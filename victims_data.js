    "story": "Anan “Nan” Phetkaew, 39, an agricultural worker from the Chaiyaphum province in northeastern Thailand, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Alumim on October 7.\n\nAnan was among the 22 Thai and Nepalese workers who were murdered in the kibbutz that morning when the terrorists attacked their living quarters with grenades and gunfire.\n\nOne survivor told Human Rights Watch that before one of the terrorists threw a grenade into their living quarters, he shouted, “Hello, Thailand,” and then in Hebrew, “You like to work so hard, now you will die.”\n\nMitchai Sarabon, another Thai survivor from Alumim, told Fox News that the terrorists threw grenades inside and opened fire: “Everything was burning, the room, the people and I just decided to jump out and run.”\n\nAnan’s body was flown back to Thailand for burial on October 20. His cremation ceremony was held several days later. He is survived by his wife, Aoyjai Chaisri, their 12-year-old daughter, and his parents.\n\nHis aunt, Wongduean Lamlert, told local media that Anan had been working in Israel for close to 2.5 years, sending money back to his family to provide them with a better life and pay off his debts after his previous business closed down during the COVID pandemic.\n\nShe told another news outlet: “The war was inhuman. We had nothing to do with it. If they wanted to regain land or attack each other, they had to evacuate people, but they did not seem to care who was who. The value of a person is of great importance to our family. My nephew was the pillar of our family and the pride of our house. But today we have to receive his lifeless body.”\n\nAnan’s mother told a local news site that her son would call her “every month. He would always send me money every month without fail. He said that he was planning to save money to build a new house and had already filled in the soil and leveled the area… I still can’t accept the loss of my beloved son, who was the pillar of the family.”\n\nWriting on Facebook in May 2024, his wife, Aoyjai, wrote that she misses the “person who secretly took photos of me, the person who always cares for me. No matter what I do, he always looks at me and cares for me. The person who does everything, no matter how difficult it is, my child and I love and miss you always, my love.”"

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Ori Gerby, 20, a soldier with the Givati Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, from Herzliya, died on January 18, 2024, of wounds sustained a day earlier while fighting in south Gaza.\n\nHe was seriously wounded by an RPG during a battle in Khan Younis and brought to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba where he succumbed to his wounds a day later. His liver and kidney were donated and saved the life of a baby and a 6-year-old girl.\n\nHe was killed alongside his friend and comrade, Staff Sgt. Oriya Ayimalk Goshen.\n\nOri was buried in Herzliya on January 19. He is survived by his parents, Naomi and Chagai, his sister, Yuval and his girlfriend, Chen.\n\nBorn in Petah Tikva, Ori and his family moved to Herzliya when he was 5 years old. Ori arrived in the world after years of his parents trying for a baby, according to an IDF eulogy.\n\nAt age 8 he started playing tennis, and quickly showed great talent in the sport and began competing, training almost daily. He also played basketball, soccer, matkot (beach paddle ball) and table tennis, his family said, as well as took up running.\n\nHe also loved to write, including writing and illustrating a book at age 9 titled “Aliens vs. Mutants from Mars,” as well as limericks and poems for his family. Ori loved photography and also loved animals and wildlife, his loved ones said.\n\nAt age 16, he gave up tennis to focus on preparing for his army service, aiming to serve in an elite unit. After finishing high school, Ori enlisted in the IDF in August 2021 and was placed in the Givati Brigade, successfully completing the lengthy training to join its reconnaissance unit.\n\nOn October 7, 2023, Ori joined his comrades battling in Kibbutz Nahal Oz to save inhabitants from the Hamas onslaught. Later, he was sent into Gaza with the start of the IDF ground campaign, fighting there for more than 100 days before he was killed.\n\n“Ori was a special child and had an inner light that radiated outward. I always felt that he was a gift for a short time,” his mother, Naomi told the Ynet news site. “When the war broke out, I felt that he wouldn’t come back. He was a competitive tennis player, an athlete, and he left tennis behind to enlist in the army. He aspired to reach as far as possible.”\n\nNaomi said that she last saw her son two months before he was killed, and they last spoke five days before, when “he said he hadn’t showered in 45 days. He said he looked like a disheveled professor and laughed his sweet laugh.”\n\nHis father, Chagai, told the news site that Ori had aspired to “serve in Sayeret Matkal and ended up in Givati. He was admired by everyone and his commanders said they would follow him into battle. It’s hard for us to say ‘was,’ it’s still not believable. Uri was the first grandson on Naomi’s side of the family. He loved animals, the safari in Ramat Gan was his second home. He was smart, he could do anything he wanted in this life.”"

All four of them – Danielle Waldman, Noam Shai, Omri Ahrak and Almog’s girlfriend, Shahar Gindi, were murdered, while Almog was kidnapped as he tried to save her.\n\nIn a separate car, his friend Alon Werber was murdered and another friend, Guy Illouz, was wounded and taken captive, dying of his wounds in Gaza.\n\nAlmog was murdered by his captors on August 29, 2024, alongside Carmel Gat, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Alex Lobanov, Eden Yerushalmi and Ori Danino.

Almog planned to propose in January 2024, his family said. They were living together near Ariel University where they were both studying; Almog was slated to enter his final year of a civil engineering degree.\n\n“For me, Almog was so much more than a big brother,” his younger sister, Amit, wrote in Ynet in January 2025. “He was another parent, an adviser, a therapist and a soulmate. He instilled in me such optimism and positivity – and in his presence, any worries I had disappeared.”\n\nAmit wrote that she didn’t believe “that somebody could hurt Almog, a person who everyone who met him fell in love with immediately. Almog, who during his civil engineering studies at Ariel would find time to give free math tutoring to kids from struggling families. My brother, who for every holiday would go out and shop for food for needy families and also volunteered in Yedidim, an organization for stranded travelers.\n\nAlmog’s younger sister said she wants the world to know the brother that she did, “who knew how to appreciate and give thanks for the little things in life. His friends called him ‘Father Sarusi,’ the leader and the moral compass of their group. He made sure to experience all the goodness the world has to offer – music and nature and people – and he got to experience true love with his girlfriend Shahar Gindi.”"

    "story": "Master Sgt. (res.) Itay Yehoshua, 36, both a reservist in the General Staff Security Unit and the 36th Division and a Shin Bet officer, from Ra’anana, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Be’eri.\n\nThe morning of the attack, Itay was home with his family when the sirens started. His wife nevertheless set out for work and shortly afterward he was called up to join the 36th Division fighting in the south. He left his daughter with his mother-in-law and set out to head to the front lines, not telling his wife in order not to worry her.\n\nItay fought all day with his comrades on the battlefield, engaging in several firefights with Hamas gunmen, first in Netiv Ha’asara and then in Kibbbutz Sa’ad and Kibbutz Alumim. In the afternoon, he arrived in Kibbutz Be’eri, where he was killed battling Hamas terrorists around 9 p.m. that evening.\n\nHe was buried on October 12 in Hadid. He is survived by his wife, Dafnie, their daughter Haley, 2, his parents Dorit and Yehoshua and his brothers Tomer and Guy.\n\nItay was born and raised in Hadid, a small town outside Lod. He always loved animals, helping raise chickens and reptiles in his backyard.\n\nHe attended high school in nearby Shoham, and after finishing he enlisted in the IDF in 2005, joining the Golani Brigade before qualifying for its elite anti-tank Orev unit. During his service he also trained as a paramedic.\n\nItay and Dafnie met when she was a flight attendant and he was working security on a flight. They wed in 2019, and their daughter was born in 2021. They settled in their apartment in Ra’anana a little over a year before he was killed. Though Itay was abroad a great deal of the time, he would always devote as much time as possible to his family when he was home, his loved ones said.\n\nIn 2010, Itay joined the Shin Bet, working as a security guard. Over the years he also worked as a mentor within the unit and was promoted to be a security team leader.\n\n“Itay was always surrounded by friends, loved life, he was a modest and moral person,” reads a Shin Bet eulogy. “Itay always volunteered for any task in his modest and quiet way.”\n\nHe also had a bachelor’s degree in business management and political science from the Open University and an MBA from the Ono Academic College.\n\nMarking six months since Itay was killed, Dafnie wrote on Facebook that the days without him “are lonelier, harder, but we keep going.”\n\n“Our Haley is still magical and special, smart and confident, even though she’s changed so much since you’ve been gone,” she wrote. “She remembers you and talks about you every day, she’s the gift you gave me, that keeps me strong.”\n\nDafnie said Itay’s absence “is felt every moment of the day, more and more as time passes by. Not a day goes by that I don’t want to tell you something, or hear about your day, share with you the little daily things — the ones that are the most missed. The salad you would make me with love, the restaurant we’d go to in Hadera, without any special reason, the trips around the world… you were the perfect partner in so many ways.”\n\nShe added that she is mourning all their future plans “that we won’t get to achieve together, like the family trip to a safari in Africa that we wanted to do with Haley. They say that time heals all wounds, but I’m still waiting for it to happen.”"

His shift was slated to end at 6:30 a.m., but when the attack began he stayed at the site of the rave helping people to evacuate, and later battling against the Hamas gunmen.\nAt 7:45 a.m. he texted his wife that there was chaos and a terror attack, adding, “I’m fine.” That was the last she heard from him.

The homeowners alerted the Alumim local security team that people had broken into their home, assuming they were terrorists.\nTwo local security team members entered the home, and Ofek assumed they were terrorists, attacking one from behind and trying to save Tamar. The officer returned fire and killed him before 8 a.m. Tamar was also shot and wounded but ultimately rescued and survived.\nOfek was buried in Holon on October 11. He is survived by his parents, Nitza and Haim, and his older brothers Tal and Eden.\nThe baby of the family, Ofek was raised in Holon, attending local schools, according to a municipal eulogy. From a young age his family nicknamed him Kiko, a moniker that stuck.\nHe started working at a young age, first at a water park, then in gardening and eventually at a gas station. After finishing high school, he enlisted in the IDF, serving in the Combat Engineering Corps, and kept working during his breaks.\nOfek completed his mandatory service during the COVID pandemic, and his big plans to travel the world were thwarted. But he kept working hard, always seeking financial independence. After years working at a gas station he sought to own his own branch, but the bank wouldn’t provide him a loan at such a young age.\nInstead, Ofek began working at a branch of a falafel eatery in Givatayim and brought it back from the brink of closure, his loved ones said.\nBut above all, Ofek loved trance music and festivals, dreaming of becoming a successful DJ and performing around the world, according to a memorial website. He had a DJ table set up in his room, and would return home after a long day of work to record music – already releasing five tracks of his own under the name Kiko — and the walls of his room were covered in foam to absorb the sound.\nHe was also a loving and doting uncle to his 4-year-old nephew, Leo.\nOfek’s girlfriend, Tamar, wrote on an Instagram memorial page, “Your face is etched into my soul and your soul will always be with me.”\nTamar said she wakes up every morning, “and I go to make coffee the way you like it: two teaspoons of Taster’s Choice — only Taster’s! — with a small teaspoon of sugar and water halfway and a splash of milk, it can’t be full all the way or it spills on you and you get annoyed.” Now, she said, she only drinks coffee the way Ofek did.\n“A week ago, I made red pasta with schnitzel and I couldn’t stop the tears because it was our meal. In general, the kitchen was our domain so it’s hard to enter, like hot dogs with Israeli couscous, stir fry, pancakes in the morning — those were all ours.”\nTamar added that it is impossible to come to terms with the fact that Ofek “is not by my side. How can it be that I’m crying next to you and you’re not wiping away my tears? How are you not smiling with your dimples and telling me that everything will be OK? How are you not with me in this long rehabilitation period?… I believe wholeheartedly that you are in a much better place than here.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Cpt. Shilo Cohen, 24, a team commander in the elite Shaldag unit, from Sderot, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas attack on Kibbutz Be’eri.\nAt the start of the attack, Shilo was home in Sderot with his family. Without waiting to be summoned, he headed out to take part in the battles and joined up with a group of Sayeret Matkal soldiers.\nThey headed first to Kibbutz Mefalsim, battling Hamas gunmen there, and later to outside Kibbutz Alumim, before they were told to head to Be’eri in the later hours of the day.\nInside Be’eri, they went home by home looking for Hamas terrorists who were holed up inside. Inside the third house they entered, Shilo was shot and wounded and Lt. Nave Lax was killed by gunfire. But Shilo kept going, and in the next home he was shot again, ultimately bleeding out from his wounds.\nShilo was buried on October 9 in Sderot. He is survived by his parents, Ruti and Aryeh, and his siblings Itay, Ravid, Izhar and Tchiya.\nBorn and raised in Sderot, Shilo was the middle child among his four siblings. He was an active participant and later camper in the local Bnei Akiva chapter, according to a Shaldag eulogy.\nShilo loved to travel around Israel, spend time hiking in nature and camping. He was also great with his hands, including learning how to weld professionally.\nHe enlisted in the IDF in December 2019, joining the Israeli Air Force’s elite Shaldag commando unit. He later completed an officer’s course, and commanded his own team in Shaldag for 11 months, until he was killed.\nHis older sister, Ravid, wrote on Instagram that she had heard so much in the wake of his death “about how you were such a hero.”\n“The people you fought with speak with admiration about a super-warrior,” she wrote. “And even though I didn’t know your military capabilities up close, I’m not surprised. Because you were a hero also in your personal life. Even though I would always tell you how talented and successful you were, you never really believed me or understood it.”\n“Everywhere you went, you were always fighting to be the best, the most exact,” she added. “And you were also my hero. Who helped me move apartments without me even asking. Who’d pick me up when I was hurt even though I’m not exactly light. Who video chatted me in the middle of the night and listened to all my nonsense even though you were exhausted.”\nShilo’s father, Aryeh, told 103FM radio that his son was part of “an act of heroism on which generations of the Jewish nation can be educated.”\nAryeh said that “despite all the pain, we thank God that this is how [his life ended], with bravery and for the people of Israel and our neighbors in Be’eri and Mefalsim. [Shilo] decided that he wanted to continue for the people of Israel with heroism, and this is what he did.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Tal Katz, 37, from Ma’alot, was killed on October 7 in Kibbutz Be’eri after fleeing there from the Supernova music festival.\nTal attended the rave with his girlfriend, Yasmin Porat, arriving there overnight. When the rocket fire began, they decided to leave the site of the festival and head home.\nThey stopped to seek safety in a roadside bomb shelter, and then heard gunfire outside. Feeling unsafe in the shelter, Tal and Yasmin decided to head to Be’eri, hoping to find safety there. They knocked on the door of Hadas and Adi Dagan, and the couple took them in and let them hide with them inside their reinforced room.\nWhen Hamas terrorists stormed the Dagan home, they took Tal, Yasmin, Hadas and Adi hostage and brought them to the house of Pessi Cohen, where they were held captive with a number of other hostages.\nWhen IDF forces gathered outside the home, one Hamas terrorist used Yasmin as a human shield to surrender to the troops, saving her life. After hours of standoff, IDF troops fired tank shells in warning at the home and then engaged in a firefight with the Hamas gunmen. Hadas was the only hostage to emerge alive.\nThe IDF said in a probe of the highly contentious incident that “most of the hostages were likely murdered by the terrorists,” though it could not determine the exact figure.\nTal was buried outside Ma’alot on October 11. He is survived by his daughter, Orian, his parents, Hana and Shai, and his siblings, Itzik and Sapir.\nBorn and raised in Ma’alot-Tarshiha in the north, Tal was the middle of his siblings, according to a state eulogy. He attended a local elementary school and went to high school in nearby Karmiel.\nHe was drawn to music as a child, learning to play the keyboard, guitar and drums and a number of other instruments. He was also very into mechanics, his loved ones said, always taking apart and reassembling electronics.\nTal worked as a medical equipment technician and also as a DJ on the side, under the stage name SPIRITAL, recording his own trance music dance tracks. He loved to attend music festivals, which is also where he met Yasmin in 2021.\nOn what would have been his 38th birthday, Yasmin wrote on Facebook that she “feels you walking hand in hand with me every day, achieving dreams with me.”\n“You pleaded with me to do so many things and I didn’t always agree with you,” she said. “Suddenly I find myself doing those things that you pushed me to do.”\nYasmin said despite feeling his presence all the time, “I miss your physical body, your embrace, your touch, your voice and your care for me, our conversations, our partying, I miss taking care of you and making you laugh — nobody will understand me the way you understood me.”\nTal’s sister, Sapir, wrote online to “my brother, my heart, my life — I don’t have many words to say, except that the longing is burning inside me every day.”\n“Nothing that fill this empty space, but thank you my brother for leaving us your little treasure, Orian, who will continue in your path and fill up the joy that you always had and that you left in our hearts — I love you, I love you so much.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 10 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

Eliran Abergel, 29, an officer in the coordination of enforcement operations unit, from Hadera, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas attack on Kibbutz Be’eri.\nThe morning of the attack, Eliran was with his wife at her parents house in Tiberias celebrating the holiday. He immediately headed down south to join his comrades, meeting up with them on the front lines.\nEliran was among those who volunteered to be the first officers entering the hard-hit Kibbutz Be’eri, driving one of two armored jeeps inside in the early afternoon.\nThe jeep was hit by an RPG shortly after entering the kibbutz, but Eliran and the others were not deterred, getting out and engaging in a firefight until all but one of them was ultimately slain.\nEliran was killed in Be’eri alongside Chief Supt. Avi Amar, Supt. Dan Ganot, Supt. Vadim Blih, Sgt. First Class Mulugeta Gadif, Sgt. Maj. Boris Danilov, Sgt. First Class Dor Mangadi, Sgt. First Class Orel Alon and civilian Ziv Shopen.\nHe was buried in Netanya on October 10.\nHe is survived by his wife, Eden, his parents, Doris and Mark, and his sisters, Sivan and Merav. His wife discovered during the shiva mourning period that she was pregnant, and their son, Ari Yehuda, was born in June 2024.\nBorn and raised in Netanya, Eliran was the youngest in the family, and attended local schools, according to an online eulogy.\nAfter finishing high school, he enlisted in the IDF, serving in the Combat Intelligence Collection Corps along the Lebanon border, later serving as a commander in the 91st Division.\nShortly after his release in 2016 he joined the Israel Police, serving in the Yasam special patrol unit based in Yafo, later in a motorcycle unit and in 2023 he moved to the coordination of enforcement operations unit.\nIn March 2023, a photo of Eliran lifting Channel 12 police reporter Branu Tegene on his shoulders during a mass anti-government protest in Tel Aviv went viral.\nHis mother, Doris, told Channel 12 that Eliran “was beloved” as a child. “He was a leader even without wanting to be, just in his own pleasant way.”\nDoris said she will most remember “his generosity, his boundless love, his laughter.”\nEliran and Eden met in 2015 and were married on October 6, 2021. They celebrated their second anniversary the day before he was killed, and they had been hoping and longing for a baby while undergoing fertility treatments that had not been successful.\nOn their anniversary, Eden told Channel 12, “he told me how much he loved me, how happy he was that we were together, side by side, and I told him that I loved him, that I was happy that he was in my life and that I couldn’t ask for a better man than him.”\nEden said her husband “was sensitive. Even though he looked really tough on the outside, he had a huge heart. He had a heart of gold, with a lot of sensitivity to those around him, and mostly to those near him who he loved. Eliran wanted lots of kids.”\nFinding out she was pregnant, she said, “was firstly a huge joy, pride, light, but it was also confusion and frustration. It was painful that Eliran didn’t know.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

They were shot dead in their vehicle along the highway.\nHis body was not identified for several weeks after he was killed, and he was buried in the Gezer Regional Cemetery outside Modiin on October 25. Ultimately, all five of the friends were buried side by side in the local cemetery.\nBen is survived by his parents, Zehava and Rafael, and his older siblings Moran and Tal.\nHe was born and raised in Beit Hashmonai, the baby of the family, arriving 10 years after his next oldest sibling.\nHis family described him in an online obituary as an entrepreneur from a young age, setting up a lemonade stand or selling used toys. As a kid, he took cooking and ceramics classes and made up new board games. Ben loved growing up in nature, riding bikes, roller blades, spending time outside, especially with animals — including his beloved bull terrier Johnny — and enjoyed manual labor, his loved ones said.\nHe had a number of hobbies, including skiing, photography, traveling around Israel and abroad, playing music and visiting the beach. Ben was also active in his local scout troop, and above all loved spending time with his close friends, in particular Dor, Eden and Yiftah.\nAfter finishing high school, he enlisted in the IDF, serving in the Kfir Brigade. After his release, he worked for a period in the local pizza shop before setting up his own handyman business for renovations, including training as a plumber. Over the past year he ran a business selling construction materials.\nHis mother, Zahava, told a culinary memorial project that what she misses most is Ben coming down the stairs every Friday morning to see what she had been cooking, moving between the different pots and sampling.\nHe especially loved fresh schnitzel — “the love of his life” — and Iraqi potato vegetable pancakes, known as Aruk, and by 10 a.m. each Friday, he’d already have had his first schnitzel of the day, she said, before his brother and father joined in.\n“I really loved pampering them on Fridays and I really miss it,” she said. “He’d always compliment me on the food, he’d say, ‘You’re crazy, how many people are coming?'”\nShe said that “Ben was our youngest, he lit up the house, he brought so much light. A man of love. He took life by storm.”\nZahava said that at his funeral, “I promised that I would continue his path, he really loved to make people happy, he was happy, he pursued justice, was a man of love, of generosity.”\n“It gives me a lot of strength to know that Ben is in a good place with his friends,” she said. “He’s not alone.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Yosef Hai “Yossi” Tahar, 39, a Shin Bet officer from Bitzaron, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas attack on southern Israel.\nHis photo is barred from publication by the Shin Bet.\nWhen Yossi realized the scale of the attack, he headed toward the front lines to help repel the Hamas invasion. When he got a call that a comrade was seriously wounded, he managed to get him in a helicopter to a hospital, saving his life.\nYossi then headed toward Kibbutz Mefalsim, where he heard a firefight was taking place. He battled with a number of Hamas gunmen until he was shot dead outside the kibbutz.\nHe was buried in Kfar Warburg. He is survived by his wife, Liat, their four children, twins Omer and Ziv, 8, Ron, 6 and Shahar, 5, his parents, Eli and Mazal and four of his siblings, Shai, Guy, Erez and Bar. His brother, Roi, was killed in 2001 in a motorcycle accident during his army service.\nYossi was named for his paternal uncle, Lt. Col. Yossi Tahar, who was killed in 1981 while fighting in Lebanon. His father, Eli, is the deputy director of Yad Lebanim, an organization for bereaved family members of fallen soldiers.\nBorn in Azrikam, a small town near Ashdod, Yossi was the fifth-oldest in the family, coming after four older brothers and ahead of his younger sister.\nYossi and Liat knew each other from high school, and began dating as teenagers in 2001 — ultimately staying together for close to 23 years and raising their four children in Bitzaron, a small town outside Ashdod.\nIn 2002, Yossi enlisted in the IDF, serving in the elite Shayetet 13 naval commando unit, according to a Shin Bet eulogy. Despite the tragedies to already hit his family, Yossi’s parents signed the forms allowing him to go into combat.\nDuring his army service, he fought in both the Second Lebanon War and Operation Cast Lead in Gaza. In 2009, shortly after he was released from the IDF, Yossi joined the Shin Bet, in the operations unit. He held a number of different positions, advancing to be team leader, then a branch leader and eventually the deputy unit chief.\nThe Shin Bet said Yossi “was a curious person, smart, sensitive to his surroundings, loving, responsible, professional and dedicated. Yossi was… a brave and cool-headed person who did not easily back down.”\nHis wife, Liat, told Globes that she was told to break the bad news to her children by stressing that he was a hero — something they’d heard many times before.\n“Because of his senior role, this was a sentence they heard all the time,” she said. “He wouldn’t be there on holidays, Shabbat or family events, because he’s saving the country.”\nLiat said that “Yossi really was an indestructible person. With him I felt the most protected, and I can’t really comprehend [that he’s gone] — can’t or don’t want to.” His loss, she said, “will accompany us all of our lives. The kids are proud that their father is a hero, but they want a dad like all of their friends, not a dad in heaven.”\nYossi’s father, Eli, told Ynet that his son “swept people along with him, not necessarily because of his rank but because of his humanity. His constant saying was ‘walk with your head up and your nose down.'”\nEli said that Yossi was named after his late brother, “and my wife added the name ‘Hai’ [life] to protect him, but it didn’t help. I didn’t believe that he could be harmed — he was a super-warrior.”\n“Yossi believed in what he was doing, he was at peace with what he was doing and he was killed because he was protecting his people,” he added. “The State of Israel owes him a lot.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 13 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

Amid the chaos the group ended splitting up, and Ziv was last seen hiding in the bushes between the parking lot and the nearby Kibbutz Re’im.\nZiv was considered missing for more than a week until his body was identified.\nHe was buried in Gevim on October 16. He is survived by his parents, Reut and Pesach, and his younger brother Guy.\nBorn and raised in Kibbutz Gevim, Ziv attended school in the nearby Sderot, according to a state eulogy.\nAfter finishing high school, he did a year of national service at a dormitory for at-risk youth who had previously been hospitalized or attended rehab. Ziv then enlisted in the IDF, serving in the Paratroopers Brigade’s reconnaissance unit.\nFollowing his release, Ziv worked for a year in the fishery at Kibbutz Ma’agan Michael in the north before taking off for 10 months of traveling around Asia. In recent years, Ziv was living in Yafo in south Tel Aviv and devoting his time to studying and perfecting his Arabic, specifically the Egyptian dialect, in which he became fluent.\nHe was slated to begin a degree in Mideast studies and international relations at Tel Aviv University just a few weeks after he was killed.\nHis friends said he had a keen sense of humor, loved sports, Hapoel Tel Aviv, dancing at music festivals and would always say that any new person he met was “first of all a king, unless proven otherwise.”\nZiv’s friend, Maya Baitner, wrote on Facebook that they met “through our shared love of the Arabic language.”\n“Ziv had an amazing vibe, he was the kind of person that always drew a lot of interest, love and smiles from everyone around,” she wrote. “Just two weeks ago, we sat on the beach in Jaffa, laughed, and talked about life… He had an exciting love and curiosity for the language, and such wide knowledge… He always knew how to find the word that I forgot how to say.”\nZiv’s younger brother, Guy, wrote on Instagram that “anything I say will minimize who you were.”\nHis brother, he said, “was always calm, always helping, always here. There are people who always know what to say, but you always knew what to do. They say people don’t remember what you said but what you made them feel — that’s you, my brother, you made everyone feel like they were the best, number one, that you’re with them until the end.”\nGuy wrote that he misses his “presence, the feeling that everything is good now, and if it’s not, then you’ll make us feel like it’s good… I want your optimism, I want your motivation, I want your calm, I want your smile, I want to know how to enjoy like you.

    "story": "Command Sgt. Maj. Meir Abergel, 54, the Sderot police station investigation coordinator, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas attack on the city.\nWhen the attack began, Meir decided immediately that he had to head toward the station, even though he was on leave for medical treatment.\nJust outside the police station, Meir was shot dead in his car by Hamas gunmen who had invaded the city and stormed the station. Meir was among eight Sderot police officers killed in battle for the station, alongside Command Sgt. Maj. Shmuel Golima, Command Sgt. Maj. David Ben Dayan, Command Sgt. Maj. Adir Shlomo, Command Sgt. Maj. Denis Belenky, Command Sgt. Maj. Yaron Dayan, Master Sgt. Eliyahu Michael Harush and First Sgt. Mor Shakuri.\nMeir was buried in Sderot on October 10. He is survived by his daughter, Idan, his mother, Tzivya, brother Yaniv and girlfriend Ayelet.\nBorn and raised in Sderot, Meir attended local schools and excelled in history and geography, according to a local eulogy.\nAfter high school he enlisted in the IDF and served in the Combat Engineering Corp, staying on for five years, beyond the mandatory period.\nRight after his release, Meir joined the Israel Police, beginning his service in October 1991 and remaining with the police force for more than 30 years, working his way up the ranks to become coordinator of investigations at the Sderot police station.\nHe was a huge fan of the Beitar Jerusalem soccer team, attending as many games as he could. His loved ones said he loved to travel in Israel and abroad, planning trips for family and friends, and also loved photography and cooking and hosting meals.\nIn recent years, Meir was diagnosed with leukemia and was undergoing treatment, but he refused to let that stop him from setting out to defend his fellow officers on October 7.\nHis daughter, Idan, wrote in a social media post that her father “accepted me as I am.”\nIdan said that despite the loss of her father, she is comforted that he always supported her, including when she came out as transgender four years earlier: “My father loved me and accepted me as I am. That’s what gives me strength to keep going in life,” she added, noting that her father would accompany her to doctor’s appointments and “supported the transition I’m going through without criticism and without thinking about how others would look at us in [Sderot].”\nIdan said she last saw her father at holiday dinner the night before, “and when the sirens sounded, Dad headed for the station — he didn’t need to, because he was on sick leave, but he insisted on joining his comrades and helping them.”\nHis girlfriend Ayelet, who he met in 2007, wrote online that Meir “was funny, had a great sense of humor, was smart. He had life wisdom, mostly.”\n“He loved to tell stories, mostly about the police and the army,” she said. “Everyone was captivated when he spoke. He loved to cook and to host people, everyone loved coming over to his house. He loved traveling in the country and abroad, he got to know the country through many trips and treks. He always saw the needs of others before his own needs… With Meir, the sky was the limit. Everything he wanted to achieve, he set a goal and made it happen.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Steven Makarchenko, 25, from Karmiel, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while trying to flee the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHe attended the rave with his girlfriend, Alisia Levin, and his friend Slava Giler. The three left the festival together via car, and their vehicle was later found abandoned near Kibbutz Mefalsim. All three were slain, and Steven’s body was identified several days later.\nHe was buried in Karmiel on October 11. He is survived by his parents, Ira and Alex, and his older brother Dima.\nSteve grew up in Karmiel in the north. He loved being out in nature and enjoyed camping, his loved ones said. From a young age, he loved cars and vehicles and counted down the days until he could get his driver’s license.\nHe was very close to his parents and his older brother, and he doted on and spoiled his young niece when she arrived in the family. He and Alisia dated for three years, and during that time he also served as a father figure to her young children, his family said.\nSteve worked as a truck driver and also worked for a company that provided services for people with disabilities, his family said.\nHis cousin, Karin, wrote on Facebook that she was struggling to come to terms with the fact that “I simply won’t see you anymore, forever… One day we’ll meet again, we’ll swap jokes, we’ll sit and chill, we’ll take a shot, we’ll light up the barbecue with some good pieces of meat — what more than that could we want?”\nKarin said she wanted to tell Steve, “Thank you, thank you for who you were, for being my cousin… thank you for every time I only needed to ask and you would show up for me. Thank you for giving me everything you could when I asked. Thank you for supporting me, for believing in me. I appreciate you so much. I’m so grateful.”\nHis sister-in-law, Keren, said she first met Steve when he was 10 or 11 years old, and over the years they shared a special bond and learned a great deal from each other.\n“I’m grateful that you were in my life, grateful that you taught me so much — about optimism, your joy for life — you knew how to smile in every situation,” she wrote on Facebook. “Thank you for your endless help, you were always the first to help and take me to every doctor’s appointment, stay with me for the surgeries and make sure I wasn’t lacking anything.”\nKeren said she felt Steve “was sending me strength every moment of the day so that I can help your parents and Dima, who were such a huge part of your life, handle things… I feel you whispering in my ear that I need to be strong, I need to hold everyone together,” she added.\n“If you were here now, you would sit next to me and find a way to laugh about this too,” she continued. “You would tell me how much you understood me and the situation I’m in. You would tell me that you’re here for me, every hour and every minute — you’re here for me.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 16 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. David Ratner, 20, a Golani Brigade soldier, from Ashdod, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the Nahal Oz IDF base.\nWhen the attack began, David, a Negevist, went up to an observation tower and began shooting at Hamas gunmen outside the base. Later, while he was next to on-base shelter, he was wounded in his neck from a bullet, but he continued fighting for many hours until he was killed.\nDavid was among the 53 soldiers killed in the Nahal Oz base, the hardest-hit IDF facility in Hamas’s October 7 onslaught.\nHe was buried on October 13 in Ashdod. He is survived by his parents, Miriam and Chaim, and his five siblings, Yosef, Esther, Shlomo, Ariel and Batel.\nThe oldest in the family, David was born in in Simferopol, Ukraine, and moved to Israel with his parents in 2005, when he was 2 years old, according to a municipal eulogy.\nGrowing up he loved sports, playing both soccer and basketball for a number of years. He loved rap music and would write his own lyrics, including during his army service. David and his family were active members of the Beit Hallel messianic Jewish congregation in Ashdod.\nAfter finishing high school, he enlisted in the IDF and joined the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, training as a Negevist — an operator of the Negev light machine gun. He served in the Golan Heights and in the West Bank before he was stationed at the Nahal Oz base.\nDavid’s girlfriend of three years, Diana, wrote on Instagram that “God took the most important person to me in the world.”\n“I didn’t think our lives together would end this way,” she wrote. “My love, I’m waiting for you to return, I can’t live without you… We were together for three years and I know that these are the best three years of my life, because you are such a unique person.”\nDiana said that David “always taught me to be the strongest woman… you’re a hero, you’re the strongest warrior in the world, you saved your friends, you fought for hours against terrorists… I’m so proud of you,” she added. “You’ve left me alone with the best memories.”\nHis mother, Miriam, told a Kan podcast that “I feel in my heart that this was David’s choice. That he was willing to give his life for the people, for all his friends, for his family. Of course he wanted to live, but this he wanted with all his heart. He did what he wanted.”\nMiriam told a local news outlet that her oldest son “was an exceptional person — strong, sensitive, generous and beloved. He radiated inner strength and peace, he was a true friend, a person who always knew how to give without expecting anything in return. He lived his life with passion and bravery, and fell when he was protecting his friends and the State of Israel with his body.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Alex Lobanov, 33, from Ashkelon, was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists from the Supernova music festival on October 7. He was held captive in Gaza for almost 11 months before he was murdered by his captors in a tunnel in Rafah on August 29, 2024.\nHis body was recovered two days later by the IDF, along with those of Ori Danino, Eden Yerushalmi, Almog Sarusi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin and Carmel Gat, and brought back to Israel for burial.\nAlex, a bartender and business owner, was working as the head barman at the desert rave when he was kidnapped. He told his wife that morning that he was trying to run and hide in the nearby forest from the terrorists attacking the festival. That was the last she ever heard from him.\nAlex was buried in Ashkelon on September 1. He is survived by his wife, Michal, their two children, Tom and Kai (who was born in March 2024 while his father was held captive), his parents, Oksana and Gregory and his brother, Anton.\nBorn in Russia, Alex moved to Israel with his family and settled in Ashkelon where he grew up. His loved ones said Alex was a prankster with a sense of humor who loved the beach and the sea, including surfing, and enjoyed jeep treks in the desert.\nHe was also a volunteer with the Yedidim organization, which helps stranded motorists.\nHe and his wife Michal met a decade earlier while he was working as a chef in a restaurant and she was a waitress. In 2019 he and a partner opened “Beer Market” in the Mahaneh Yehuda market in Jerusalem, but it didn’t survive the COVID pandemic. Later Alex established his own company providing bar services for events and parties — which is what brought him to Supernova.\nThe couple’s first son, Tom, was born in 2021, and Kai was born while his father was being held hostage in a Hamas tunnel.\nIn his memory, his family set up a memorial website describing Alex as having “a huge heart, a captivating smile, rolling laughter that made everyone happy. He loved nature, lived by the sea, and mostly loved to help and give to others.”\nHis loved ones said they hope to set up a physical memorial for Alex, “a magical corner in nature, with a picnic table, benches and a barbecue, exactly as Alex loved in life, to hang out, be happy and enjoy with family and friends.”\nHe and his two closest childhood friends, Dima and Zohar, called themselves the “three musketeers” and had a shared tattoo of three swords with the letters of their names and the words “all for one and one for all.” Zohar told Ynet that Alex “was our glue, he always connected everyone, wherever we went. He’s not a regular person, he never gets stuck, he’s always looking for something new — ‘let’s open this business, let’s do that.'” Dima said, “Alex is the one who makes things happen in our group. He announces new ideas and carries them out.”\nAt his funeral, his wife, Michal, described Alex as “the best father and the best husband” in the world.\n“Love of my life… it is really true that God takes the best,” she cried. “I want to focus on your love of others, your love of life and freedom, a freedom that was taken from you on October 7 by those despicable people.”\nMichal said Alex was “the best father in the world, the best person that I knew… Thank you for the privilege of being a mother and being your wife.\nShe promised to raise their two children with Alex’s “values and ethics” and said that he would be “our one and only hero.”\n“Please come to me in [my] dreams, send me signs. Rest, my sweetheart, now you can rest,” she added. “Please send me strength, I will be yours forever and ever until we meet again.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Yiftah Dan Tweg, 27, from Azaria, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nYiftah attended the rave with a group of four close childhood friends – Eden Moshe, Ben Binyamin Cohen, Tamar Gutman and Dor Toar — who were all slain in the attack that day.\nWhen the rocket fire began, the friends split up, and Yiftah stayed at the site of the festival. At some point in the morning, after he was already wounded, he decided to hide inside a large dumpster along with a group of others, hoping to avoid detection.\nHe spoke to his family and told them that he was fine, and not to worry.\nAt 11:47 a.m., Hamas gunmen discovered those hiding inside the dumpster and opened fire. Yiftah and eight others were murdered there: Ilkin Nazarov, Inbar Shem Tov, Ron Yehudai, Hadar Prince, Amit Levy, David Newman, Maya Bitton and Eliran Mizrahi. Yiftah managed to protect two young women with his body who were wounded inside the dumpster but survived.\nYiftah was considered missing for more than a week until his family was informed on October 15 that his body had been identified.\nThe five childhood friends were buried side by side in the Gezer Regional Cemetery outside Modiin. Yiftah is survived by his parents, Shoshana and Meir, and his siblings Rami, Sivan and Keren.\nYiftah, the youngest in the family, grew up in Azaria, a small community near Ramle. He arrived as a surprise, when his mother was 43 years old, and his older siblings were 21, 19 and 16. In a way, his family said, Yiftah grew up with five parents always watching out for him.\nHe attended high school in Beit Hashmonai, and after graduating, he enlisted in the IDF and served as a combat soldier in the Armored Corps. Following his release, Yiftah began working in event production and specialized in LED lighting, and he planned to soon begin his studies.\nYiftah and his friends loved extreme sports, including ski trips, mountain biking and off-roading. He also loved and played soccer, and he was most known for his love of tea, and how he always liked to sit with friends and sip on a steaming cup of tea and talk about life. In his memory, Wissotzky issued a special line of tea called “Yiftah’s Magic.”\nHis sister, Keren, told the Ynet news site that “Yiftah was — as often is with the youngest — the prince of the house,” noting the large gaps between the siblings.\n“We all raised him together,” she said. “He was connected to all of his siblings in a different way — if it was through cooking with my sister or studying Gemara with my brother. He knew how to reach everyone.”\nKeren said that “Yiftah was an unusually smart guy. He was a big prankster, but anytime Mom would arrive at the school, they would say, ‘The genius’s mom is here.” Keren said that despite their 20-year age gap, “I wouldn’t take any step without seeking his advice and asking his opinion. He was always modest, helped others, we keep hearing more and more stories about him.”\nSpeaking to a local news site, his father, Meir, noted that he was close to 50 when Yiftah was born, “and I would take him to kindergarten or the playground, and I had to make myself fit in with all the other parents who were younger than me.”\nIn school, Meir said, his youngest son “was always smart. He learned everything himself. In the army, he was a combat soldier,” recalling attending his beret march “with great pride.”\nAt just age 27, he said, Yiftah “was a businessman, he worked in event production,” and he sought to take care of his parents: “He always helped,  he didn’t want us to worry about him. He didn’t want to be a burden.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 19 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

When he realized what was going on, decided he had to set out and join the battle.\nThough he hadn’t been called up, Michael left the house at 8:20 a.m. and convinced some of his comrades to join him. He was on his way to gather weapons from Zikim when he encountered a cell of Hamas gunmen and engaged in a firefight, killing several of them, before he was shot dead.\nHe was buried in Ashkelon on October 13. He is survived by his wife, Aviya and their son, Lavi, 2, his parents, Marina and Yaakov and his siblings, Yafit, Tzlil, Ariel and Elad.\nMichael’s older brother, Netanel, was killed in 2012 in a gunfight with a Palestinian infiltrator near the Gaza border while he was serving in the IDF.\nBorn and raised in Ashkelon, Michael grew up in a religious family, attending a local yeshiva and then a religious pre-military academy, according to a state eulogy.\nAccording to an online memorial page, Michael studied mixed martial arts as a teen and also volunteered with the Israel Fire and Rescue Services.\nHe enlisted in the IDF in November 2017, joining the Golani Brigade and serving as a sniper and later a commander.\nAfter he and Aviya wed in 2019, they decided to change their family name from Mosheashvili to Ben Moshe. Their son Lavi was born in April 2021.\nIn 2021, he joined the Shin Bet, “demonstrating great dedication and commitment,” the agency wrote in a eulogy.\nThe Shin Bet described him as “strong-willed, dominant and charismatic, with a strong work ethic, very social and deeply admired. Michael was endowed with emotional intelligence, maturity and caring.” The agency added that he was a “natural leader who never compromised on his values… and always acted with integrity.”\nAviya told the Ynet news site that the pair met when they were 16, when she attended a Torah class in memory of Michael’s brother, Netanel.\n“I was crying, and Michael saw me and came over to me. I came again, and after every class he would come over to me — that’s how we started to talk,” she said. “We got to know each other because of his brother, and now they’re buried next to each other.”\nAviya said she always sensed that “this moment would come. I would look at him and cry and say, ‘Stop, don’t always be the first one to act, I’m afraid,'” she said. “Michael would always hug me and say, ‘I don’t want to die, I want to grow old with you.’ But it couldn’t be helped.”\nShe said their son, now 3, “knows everything and understands everything. But he’s strong and he knows that Dad is a hero, and that he went and he saved us.”\nHis father, Yaakov, wrote on Facebook to “my heroic son. You were always a role model and an inspiration.”\n“I thank God for the privilege that you were my son,” he added. “It is so hard for me without you. I pray and hope to see you together with Nati soon, with the redemption of the people of Israel.”\nYaakov said that Michael’s “heroic actions will serve as a model for learning and admiration. I believe that you and Nati will work together with all of the heroes to establish peace among us.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

He is survived by his parents, Lizi and Yitzhak, and his siblings Ori, 14, and Emma, 6.\nBorn and raised in Tel Aviv, Amit was always a free spirit, his family said, and was very opinionated.\nHe attended high school in Tel Aviv and he was slated to begin his studies at the BPM College of Music in Tel Aviv shortly after he was killed.\nAmit’s family said he loved nature and loved to watch the sunrise, but more than anything he loved music and trance music festivals, and dreamed of producing his own music and performing at festivals in Israel and around the world.\nHis family didn’t let anybody touch the music he left behind until Eliya returned from captivity. They shared a video online of Eliya working on Amit’s tracks in March 2025.\nSingers Netta Barzilai and Kfir Tsafrir — a friend of Ziv — released a duet, titled “Natek Oti,” (Disconnect Me) inspired by a line in the eulogy Amit’s mother read at his funeral, which she said was something he would say when a conversation got too heavy.\nAmit’s younger brother, Ori, said in a memorial video that there “were two versions of Amit, the quiet, calm Amit with his family, and the Amit of music festivals, louder… more dominant, dancing with energy. He was a very social guy, he connected to everyone.”\nWhen he and Karin started dating, Ori said, Karin urged the brothers to become closer, “and we’d go out to movies together, we’d order food at night… In the summer vacation we’d order hamburgers at 2 or 3 a.m.”\nSpeaking at a Memorial Day ceremony at his high school, Amit’s mother, Lizi, said what she feels the most is the quiet.\n“I miss his shouts when he’s playing on the computer with friends,” she said. “I miss the trance music that rang out loudly from his room. I miss the noise of his friends coming up and down the stairs in the middle of the night. I miss our arguments and our laughter.”\nNow that he is gone, she said, “There’s nobody who sends me a ‘what is there to eat’ message or sends me new food trends or a TikTok video of a new restaurant that just opened. I want us to remember him as he would have wanted — a boy of peace, love, music and freedom.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "First Sgt. Dror Altun, 29, an officer in the elite Yamam counter-terror unit, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nDror was home the morning of the attack, and was immediately called up to head to the front lines. He and his comrades arrived at the Sha’ar Hanegev Junction which was beset by Hamas gunmen.\nThey and other Border Police officers worked to repel the Hamas invasion but they were vastly outnumbered. Dror was slain there in battle alongside fellow Yamam officers Supt. Moshael Shlomo and Sgt. Maj. Bar Sivan.\nHe is survived by his wife Clil, their son Erez, his parents Avi and Ruti and his older brothers Omri and Yuval. He was buried in Misgav on October 9.\nThe youngest in the family, Dror was born and raised in Tzurit, a small town in the Western Galilee, according to a police eulogy.\nFrom a young age he was fiercely independent and loved to be outdoors, his family said, including once sneaking out of kindergarten, arriving at home and climbing in through the window.\nHe played soccer with a local team from a young age, but also loved dancing, learning ballroom dancing and even taking ballet lessons. He performed around the country and even traveled abroad with his troupe to Brazil and South Korea.\nDror enlisted in the IDF in March 2013 and served in the Combat Engineering Corps. He completed a commander’s course and was about to start an officer’s course when Operation Protective Edge began, and he took part in the fighting in Gaza.\nAfterward, he completed the officer’s course and was appointed as a platoon commander and later commander of the battalion’s reconnaissance unit.\nIn 2019, Dror joined the Israel Police, completing the rigorous training to serve in Yamam and later training as a sapper, becoming a deputy team commander.\nDror and Clil met in middle school and were quickly inseparable, becoming a couple at age 14. After Dror completed his army service, they traveled together to Tanzania to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and scale peaks in China, Nepal, India, and Thailand.\nIn 2020, Dror and Clil got married and in March 2023, their son, Erez, was born and Dror was devoted to being the best father possible.\n“Dror worked to be better than the person he was yesterday and always wanted to cause the people around him to be better to themselves,” wrote Clil on Facebook ahead of Memorial Day 2024.\n“Dror was a true friend. He wasn’t satisfied with polite friendships, he would ask how people were getting by financially, how their relationships were really going, their communication, how things were with the kids,” she said. “He always believed that everyone around him could achieve anything and infected them with that belief.”\nClil said that her husband “always told his friends yes. No matter if it was going out for a beer or helping move apartments. And he was a little brother, but the brother who calls his big brothers just to chat and forces them to go out together, and reminds them to call their parents.”\nDror was “the son who helped with the cooking for Shabbat. The grandson who always asked Savta questions so she could tell the stories he knew she loved to tell.” In addition to all that, she said, “he was a father and a partner, but on that, perhaps one day I’ll write a book.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 22 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Maj. (res.) David Haim Meir, 31, a Sayeret Matkal soldier, from Jerusalem, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Be’eri.\nA reservist in the elite unit, David was called up the morning of the attack, and quickly headed south toward the front line.\nMeeting up with his comrades, they headed first to Kibbutz Kfar Aza, where they helped treat the wounded at the gate outside. According to his family, David wanted to enter the kibbutz but his commander said no, since they couldn’t make contact with the other forces inside and he was concerned about friendly fire.\nThe team then headed in the afternoon to Kibbutz Be’eri, where David was killed while they were trying to root out Hamas terrorists hiding inside homes. Two other Sayeret Matkal soldiers were killed in Be’eri that day — Maj. Amir Skoury and Lt. Nave Lax.\nDavid was buried on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem on October 10. He is survived by his wife, Anat, their son, Shaked, 7 months, his parents, Yair and Chaya and his six siblings, Ori, Achiya, Naama, Avital, Tzuriel and Gilat.\nHis father, Yair, died several months after David was killed.\nA photo of David’s baby son, Shaked, grinning at his graveside on the month anniversary of his death, struck a chord with many Israelis.\nThe youngest of seven siblings, David grew up in the West Bank settlement of Kochav Hashahar, according to a state eulogy. He attended a local elementary school and went to a yeshiva high school in the Kiryat Arba settlement.\nDavid loved sports and extreme activities, including playing soccer, riding mountain bikes, running marathons and challenging himself on ninja workout courses.\nAfter high school he attended the Bnei David pre-military yeshiva academy and then enlisted in the IDF in December 2011, joining the elite Sayeret Matkal unit. He completed an officer’s course and spent a total of seven years in the unit, staying on beyond the mandatory service period.\nFollowing his release, David worked in hi-tech and then in investments, before getting a job as the VP of business development at a real estate firm in Jerusalem.\nDavid and Anat married in 2021 and settled in the Nahlaot neighborhood of Jerusalem. When his son, Shaked, was born in early 2023, David was overjoyed with the new world of fatherhood.\nDespite her husband’s long military career and ongoing reserve duty, Anat never imagined she would lose him this way.\n“He enjoyed every moment of civilian life and family and being home, it had nothing to do with our life that he died in the army,” Anat told the Mako news site. “But that was so David, to die in the most heroic manner. To live a full family life, but the moment that he was needed, to give everything.”\nAnat said David would be embarrassed by all the attention he received in his death, because “he always played things down. One of the dissonances in David was that he was very confident, but he didn’t hold himself in high regard. He always gave others space and praised others, he hated when people brought up that he was in Sayeret Matkal, he didn’t like it. He didn’t want to date someone who just wanted to go out with him because he was in Sayeret Matkal.”\nAnat said that at his funeral, his commander eulogized him very aptly: “With a shy smile and the determination of a herd of elephants, there was no task you couldn’t handle.”\nShe said that their son, Shaked “looks so much like [David], he’s sweet and happy.”\nOn his gravestone, she said, they wrote a line from a Naomi Shemer song, “A Father’s Song,” with the lyrics, “It is not in vain, my brother, that you have hewn stones for a new building, for from these stones, a temple will be built.”\nDavid, she said, “loved classic Israeli songs, he knew all the words. I would call him “Beyonce” because he really knew how to belt a tune. Among all the moments of him singing, I found a video of him singing to his son, and it was this song. This is really his last wish. I am sure that something big will still come from him. That his death was not in vain.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Others were taken hostage, including Nepali citizen Bipin Joshi, who is still believed to be held captive in Gaza.\nKC Pramod, who survived the attack, told the Guardian that he watched as Ganesh and another friend, Dipesh Raj Bist, were shot dead in front of him.\n“We started shouting, ‘We are Nepali, we are Nepali,’ but they didn’t listen to anyone, they just kept firing and threw two grenades into the bunker,” Pramod told the newspaper. “After that, the bunker was completely covered in blood.”\nGanesh’s body arrived back in Nepal for burial on October 26. His cremation ceremony was held the next day. He is survived by his parents, Dhanlal and Lakshmi, and his siblings.\nAccording to the Nepali Times, Ganesh was a “bright agricultural student” and was studying to specialize in tissue culture, also known as cellular agriculture.\nHis family told the Kantipur news site that the last time they spoke to him was when he called them on Friday evening, worried about news of an earthquake in Nepal. Their family home had been damaged in the quake, they said, and he urged them not to stay in it if it was unsafe.\nHis father told the news outlet that the last thing he said to them was, “‘Don’t worry about me, you guys should stay safe.’ He came home as a dead body himself.”\nA professor at the university where he was studying told Kantipur that “Ganesh’s ability was superior to others not only in studies but also in songs/music and literature. It is very sad to lose a very hardworking and promising young man who got along with everyone.”\nOn September 17, Ganesh posted a photo of himself arriving at Ben Gurion Airport, writing: “Looking for myself inside the crowd of millions.” In his profile, he described himself as a “future agriculturalist.”\nAfter just settling into his new temporary home, Ganesh shared seven photos on Facebook on October 6, 2023, with the caption: “Night view of the Alumim, Israel,” adding in two Israeli flag emojis and a heart.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 25 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

While traveling along the highway, they saw what they initially assumed to be IDF soldiers before they realized they were Hamas gunmen.\nAdam and Shani were both shot dead in their vehicle. Adam’s body was identified several days later, and Shani’s family was not informed of her death for another week.\nAdam was buried in Ashdod on October 10. A week later, Shani was buried nearby.

His body was not identified for more than a week.\nShlomo was buried in Ashkelon on October 15.

You were murdered by depraved terrorists when you just went out to have fun and enjoy and you didn’t come home. I love you so much, we will always remember you.”\nShlomo’s niece, Eve, wrote on Facebook that her uncle was “a man whose smile never left his face, he was always laughing, always making those around him happy.”\n“You loved life the way only you, Shlomo, knew how to love it,” she added. “Your voice is ingrained in my mind accompanied by laughter. They always came together with you.”\nAfter he was gone, said Eve, the family heard “from so many people who came and told us how much you helped them, how much you gave without thinking twice, on a weekly/monthly basis you would financially support people you knew were lacking… You did it all with modesty and without anyone knowing.”\n“You had so much kindness,” she added. “Love for others and true love for all.

    "story": "Goyitom “Gigi” Gebrehiyet, 40, an Eritrean asylum seeker living in Sderot, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in the city that day.\nEarly that morning, he got up to go for a run in the city, not knowing that it had been invaded by terrorists.\nWhile he was out on a jog, he was mowed down by Hamas gunmen on Herzl Street.\nHis body was flown back to Eritrea for burial.\nGigi is one of three asylum seekers — along with Adam “Puma” Brema and Wolderaphael “Tiger” Hagos — who were slain by Hamas that day. Since they entered Israel illegally, they are not recognized by the state for the purpose of benefits, unlike foreign workers from Thailand, Nepal and the Philippines who came on work visas.\nAccording to Haaretz, Gigi, as he was known to his friends, worked as a carpenter and car mechanic before he left his home country.\nHe settled in Sderot in 2008 where he worked as a welder.\nHis younger brother, Merwahi Gebrehiyet, who lives in Tel Aviv, told Haaretz that he tried to call his brother at 8 a.m. that day but he received no answer, not knowing that it was already too late and Gigi had been murdered.\n“I didn’t know what to do,” he said. When his brother’s body was identified, and social workers came to inform him, “I didn’t ask what had happened to him, and they didn’t say,” he told the newspaper.\nMerwahi said that his older brother always took care of him, after they lost their mother at a young age and more recently when he was injured in a car accident.\n“He wasn’t just my brother,” he told Haaretz. “He was like a mother and father to me… The two of us were here alone,” he added. “When I needed something, he was the one who thought about me. Everything that I ever wanted, he got me.

    "story": "Avidan Gamliel Torgeman, 26, from Masu’ot Yitzhak, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nAvidan attended the rave alongside four childhood friends – Aviel Rahamim, Eldad Bergman, Ido Ben Zino and Oded Abergel, all of whom were also murdered that day.\nHe was also part of the team, along with Oded, Shoval Yaakov and Dror Bahat who were responsible for setting up the stage and the lighting for the festival, arriving there on Friday to do so.\nAfter working all day, they rested for a few hours Friday night before returning very early Saturday to the site of the festival. At the start of the attack. Avidan and the others hid under the stage they built, where they were all shot dead by Hamas gunmen.\nAvidan was buried in Masu’ot Yitzhak on October 10. He is survived by his parents, Michael and Monique, and his six siblings, Doron, Elilea, Kaniel, Prielle, Amior and Tahel.\nBorn in Bordeaux in southern France, Avidan is the fourth-oldest in his religious family, the “sandwich” child among the seven kids, according to a municipal eulogy. As a young child, his family moved to Israel, settling in Masu’ot Yitzhak, a small community not far from Ashdod.\nHe was known as a bit of a class clown, always making his classmates giggle and bringing laughter to every occasion. After finishing high school, he enlisted in the IDF, joining the Armored Corps and serving as a tank gunner, including along the Syrian border.\nFollowing his release he worked in a number of different manual jobs, enjoying working with his hands, until he and a friend decided to set up their own business dealing with real estate in the United States. He also loved to drive and got a license for a number of different types of vehicles, including his motorcycle which he loved to ride around the country.\nHe was close with his six siblings and doted on his many nieces and nephews, his family said.\nHis sister, Prielle, told the Srugim news site that Avidan “was a person who was all about giving with love, and he managed to achieve quite a few dreams in his short life… He celebrated life in an endless dance.”\n“He was a devoted family man and every member of the family got to have a special and different relationship with Avidan,” she added. “The nieces and nephews are Uncle Avidan’s biggest fans, with him they did all the nonsense and fun and every time he’d enter the house, a crowd of them would run to him with a huge smile.”\nPrielle said that her brother “had the sensitivity to accept different situations and to help people who needed attention and help — whether that be a social situation or technical assistance with his golden hands, he answered any request for help with a smile and always did it with love and in the best way possible.”\nAvidan’s father, Michael, told Ynet that he wasn’t surprised his son was helping out with the production of the Supernova rave, “because that was Avidan. He was someone who always loved to help and simply couldn’t say no.”\nMichael said his son “had a very developed emotional intelligence. It helped him develop a large circle of friends and also to succeed in business with a company that deals with real estate investments in the US. I will remember his sensitivity, his caring, his endless love for his family. He loved life so much, he made sure to take advantage of every moment in it.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 31 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Maj. Raz Peretz, 24, commander of a combat support company in the Golani Brigade, from Afula, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas attack on the Kissufim IDF outpost.\nThe morning of the attack, Raz and his company were stationed at the IDF outpost not far from the Gaza border. When he realized what was happening, he gathered the 18 other soldiers on base in the bomb shelter and organized a plan of action.\nFrom inside the shelter, Raz began firing at the Hamas gunmen inside the base, until he was hit in his arm and had to switch hands. He later charged out of the shelter to engage in a closer-range battle with the gunmen and was shot and killed.\nRaz was slain that day alongside six of his soldiers: Staff Sgt. Yogev Aharon, Staff Sgt. Or Asto, Staff Sgt. Brando Flores Garcia, Staff Sgt. Eviatar Ochayon Abukasis, Staff Sgt. Teshager Taka and Sgt. Uriel Segal. The other 12 soldiers survived.\nHe was buried in Afula on October 11. He is survived by his fiance, Noam, his parents, Nava and Roni and his siblings Hadar and Itamar.\nThe oldest in his family, Raz was born and raised in Afula, attending local schools, according to an IDF eulogy. His two major interests, his family said, were soccer and music.\nHe learned a number of instruments as a child, focusing most on drums, and later bought turntables and began experimenting as a DJ during parties for his friends — something he continued while on weekend breaks from the army.\nAfter high school he took a trip to Thailand with family and friends and when he returned he enlisted in the IDF in July 2017, joining the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion. He completed a squad commander’s course and later an officer’s course, becoming a deputy company commander.\nRaz signed up to stay in the IDF past the mandatory period, and then completed a company commander’s course, and was appointed a company commander in the 51st Battalion.\nRaz and Noam met in the 5th grade and their close friendship turned romantic toward the end of high school. In 2021 they moved in together, and in April 2023 he proposed, and the pair set a wedding date for March 7, 2024.\nA month after he was killed, Noam wrote to Raz on Instagram: “My love, you were my support system, the most stable pillar of strength in my life, the most pure and good love.”\nNoam recalled how they became friends in middle school, when she met “a boy with sandy hair and freckles. A boy who became my best friend before anything. Everyone at school knew that there was no Noam without Raz and no Raz without Noam. Close, glued together, inseparable.”\n“The love of my life, you were my secret keeper, we went through everything together — from elementary school to middle school, high school until your enlistment,” she continued. “Seven years of being in a relationship, a healthy and loving relationship, the kind that can’t be explained. Soulmates who met each other. You were the person who always completed me.”\nRaz’s father, Roni, told Army Radio that his oldest son “was a boy with very unique values, a musical kid from when he was little, he loved music and played many instruments. He was always happy and made sure to make others happy. He played the drums, guitar, keyboard, and in recent years he was also a DJ.”\nRoni said that Raz “always wanted to join Golani, he liked the familial nature, the togetherness, the brotherhood — there’s something special there that he always connected to… he really loved it. He wanted to give a significant service to the country.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

They sought safety in a roadside bomb shelter not far from the site of the festival.\nNot long after, terrorists arrived and attacked the partygoers, throwing grenades inside the structure. Dan and Omer were both wounded, and Ron ran out to try and fight back and was killed. Afterward more terrorists came by and opened fire on them again.

We always said that we would work and he’d be the one who’d make money in the end. He had a great sense of humor, he loved festivals and partying, he took the world by storm.”\nBen said the four older siblings were always more academically inclined, while Dan chafed at strict frameworks and expectations. “Now I want to see him as a role model, to learn from him how to approach life.”\nHis mother, Talila, wrote on Facebook a month after he was killed, on what would have been his 23rd birthday: “My Dan, our Dan, is 23 today.

You managed to travel in the world, both alone and with friends, and you collected along the way many more, including those you met for just a moment and immediately clicked with.”\n“You taught us so much about hard work and dedication, uncompromising friendship and so much joy and life wisdom,” she continued. “You had so many dreams and plans that will never come true.

The bus station also served as a bomb shelter which was supposed to electronically unlock when there were rocket sirens in the city. As they were standing outside, a rocket siren sounded in the city but the door malfunctioned, and the group of travelers were stuck outside.\nMoments later, a pickup truck of Hamas terrorists drove by and opened fire on the group, killing all 13 passengers.

She always acted like everything was fine, even when it wasn’t, and she was willing to do anything for me, just to put a smile on my face.”\n“She was my role model, she was everything to me,” she added. “Every time my mother went to work, she would stay with me and play with me, and every time I was sick she would take care of me and give me her whole soul. Savta had no holds barred when it came to me, and she would do anything to put a smile on my face.”\nEva said her grandmother “was shy, with the biggest heart.

He is survived by his parents, Sima and Eyal and his older brothers, Elior and Ohad.\nBorn and raised in Karmiel, Itamar was the youngest in the family, raised in a traditional Jewish home and educated in local schools.\nHe loved soccer, and was a devoted fan of the Beitar Jerusalem team, and also played the sport regularly with friends, according to his loved ones. He was very close to his family, both his parents and siblings as well as his wider extended family, they said.\nItamar dreamed of joining the Golani Brigade and following in his older brother’s footsteps, and intensified his workouts as his enlistment date approached. In December 2022 he enlisted in the IDF and was placed in Golani, completing his training and being stationed with the 13th battalion at the Paga outpost. He was slated to begin a squad commander’s course just a few weeks after his death.\nHis older brother, Elior, who served in the same battalion as Itamar, recalled frantically searching for him after the Hamas attack, barely unable to accept his fate, and marveling in his final acts of bravery.\n“But that was you — you saved everyone, you were just the best,” Elior wrote on a memorial page. “So I got up, I got up because that’s what you would have wanted, I got up and worked, I got up and kept going because I knew that you did everything to defend the country, the battalion, the company, your friends, I kept going in your path, in our path.”\nElior said everything he did “was in your memory, my little brother, a hero of Israel. You’re my brother forever, my little brother, I’ll admire you forever.”\nHis other brother, Ohad, wrote online: “I want to tell you my little brother, that there is nothing in the world I love like you, and nobody in the world will understand the connection between us, you were my brother, my king.”\nOhad said Itamar “was killed as a hero, you protected your friends and the whole country, you’re a martyr, pure holiness, the most pure boy I know. I miss you so much. I don’t know how I’ll go on without you Itamar, you were a part of me… I am your biggest admirer.

    "story": "Sakda Surakhai, 32, from Khai Bok Wan in the Nong Khai province of northeast Thailand, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7.\nKurat Kha-Fluan, a Thai laborer who survived the attack on the kibbutz, told Ma’ariv that “I’ll never forget the terrifying and horrible moments when the Hamas came to our shelter, and starting shooting in every direction — I mostly remember chaos and confusion,” he said, noting that he had blocked out “some of the details, the moments when I saw my friends murdered in front of my eyes.”\nIn total, 11 Thai nationals were murdered by Hamas in Nir Oz — including brothers Apichart and Phongthep Kusaram — and five others were kidnapped to Gaza. Two of those kidnapped were released in November 2023, two more were freed in January 2025 and one, Pinta Nattapong, is still believed to be held hostage.\nSakda’s body arrived back in Thailand on October 26 for his funeral. He is survived by his wife, Thanita Rahom, their two children, ages 7 and 4, his father, Weerha, and his siblings.\nHis mother died on September 25, 2023, less than two weeks before he was slain.\nIn a Facebook post that day, Sakda wrote “Go be an angel in heaven, Mom. No more pain and suffering,” adding: “In the next life, I want to be born as your child again.”\nSakda had arrived in Israel on a five-year contract on October 6, 2022, almost exactly a year before he was killed.\nIn a Facebook post a few days before departing, Sakda wrote that he “said goodbye to his father and mother to go work far away,” adding that he was “sorry I couldn’t be here to take care of you when you’re old.”\nOver the year he was working in Israel he shared images of life on the farm, showing him driving tractors, harvesting pomegranates, picking potatoes and drinking beer and traveling around the country on days off, dotting his posts with Israeli flag emojis.\nIn a February 2023 post, he shared images from the fields, writing: “It’s called work, if you can do it, it’s great.”\nHis brother wrote on Facebook that this has been “the most devastating and difficult year of my life. Miracles don’t exist. Sleep well, little brother. Go to a good place. Go take care of our mother in heaven. Don’t worry about the people left behind. I’ll take care of them myself. I’ll do my best. If there’s a next life, let’s be siblings again.”\nHis sister Jaruwan wrote on Facebook sharing a post of the last time they were together, writing: “Sad memories, I miss you my lovely little brother. Not seeing each other for 9 years is not as painful as not seeing each other again.”\nHis father Weerha told a local Thai news outlet that when he learned of the attack on Israel, “I could only ask my wife’s spirit to take care of my son and keep him safe, but it was to no avail. My son died as well. It was very sad, the family losses coming at the same time. I still can’t accept it.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 37 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Yitzhak Levy, 26, from Beit Shemesh, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while trying to flee the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHe attended the rave with two friends, Yehuda Becher and Abigael Guedj. When the attack began, the three of them fled via car while coming under fire from terrorists.\nAbigael told Channel 12 news that Yehuda was shot dead first while driving, and Yitzhak tried to grab the steering wheel but was soon also shot dead. Hamas terrorists kidnapped Abigael and shoved her into the trunk of a vehicle and began to head for the Gaza border — but they were killed by IDF soldiers and Abigael was rescued.\nYitzhak was buried in Jerusalem, alongside Yehuda, on October 15. He is survived by his parents, Yaakov and Tzipora, and his eight siblings.\nYitzhak was born to French immigrant parents and raised in a large ultra-Orthodox family as part of the Breslov Hasidic community. The fourth-oldest child, Yitzhak’s family lived first in Safed, then in Gush Etzion and later in Beit Shemesh, according to an online memorial page.\nHe attended ultra-Orthodox schools, although when he struggled to find himself there his family sent him for a period to study in yeshiva in France, where he lived in Paris and later Lyon before returning to Israel around age 18. He lived for a period with his grandparents in Netanya, and then settling in Jerusalem, renting an apartment in the Nahlaot neighborhood.\nThough he left behind the ultra-Orthodox lifestyle, he remained close with his family, his parents said, as well as to elements of observant life, including visiting Uman, Ukraine on Rosh Hashana. Yitzhak worked as a counselor with an organization for at-risk youth, which encouraged him to pursue higher education, and he began a college prep academy linked to the Hadassah Academic College aimed at eventually training as a social worker.\n“YItzhak was special,” his younger brother, Avi, told a local news outlet. “He was loved by people and he loved people in a way unique to him. He always connected to people who were hard to connect to. You could see it in his surroundings, that everyone was very different. He had Hasidic friends and the crowd he’d go to festivals with. Friends of all stripes.”\nAvi said his older brother “knew how to accept every person, he didn’t care who they were or what they did, he was interested in their soul and the person. That’s what connected him to people.” In the period before his death, Avi said Yitzhak started school, “invested in his degree and really invested in himself.”\nHe loved the outdoors, “loved the earth that God gave us, for him it was a gift, and so was life. Yitzhak also loved animals and would take care of them,” Avi said. “Whenever I would look at him I remember I saw a person who was very connected to nature. As my big brother, he was a role model for me.”\nWriting on Facebook, his cousin, Yohanna, marked six months “without your voice, smile, wisdom, beauty, compassion, kindness, uniqueness, humanity, modesty, caring, empathy, tenderness, innocence and your gaze.”\nOn what would have been his 27th birthday, Yohanna wrote that she hopes “you are in a better and happier place, sitting with Papi, Gil, Yehuda and everyone you loved and who loved you back… You won’t get to see 27, but thank you for all the 26 years you gave us, our beautiful boy. I love you forever and I’ll miss you forever.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Sgt. Maj. Bar Sivan, 33, an officer in the Israel Police’s Yamam counter-terror unit, from Kochav Yair, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nBar and his comrades were called up at the start of the attack and sent to the front lines to battle the Hamas onslaught.\nHe engaged in a firefight with Hamas gunmen at the Sha’ar Hanegev Junction outside Sderot, and was slain alongside fellow Yamam officers Supt. Moshael Shlomo and First Sgt. Dror Altun.\nHe was buried in Kochav Yair on October 10. He is survived by his wife, Ayelet, his parents, Yaron and Inbal and his sister, Paz.\nBar was born in Kfar Saba and at age 5 moved to the nearby town of Kochav Yair, according to an online memorial page.\nHe attended schools in Kochav Yair and in Beit Berl. As a child he was active in the scout troops and was also a talented and dedicated judo practitioner, who took part in national competitions. He also volunteered with the Fire and Rescue Services as a teen.\nAfter finishing high school, he enlisted in the IDF and served in its rescue and training division, completing with the rank of major. Following his release, he traveled around South and Central America.\nIn January 2020, Bar enlisted in the Israel Police, joining the elite Yamam unit where he remained for the next four years, including serving as a deputy team commander.\nIn a memorial post, Yamam wrote that “Bar had a huge heart, a wide and contagious smile. He was a moral guy full of charisma and charm, a talented chef and a true friend.”\n“Bar had an incredible ability to read between the lines, to understand people and to relate to the person in front of him,” the unit added. “A warrior in every fiber of his being, on the judo mat or in the alleys of the kasbah, he was determined and never gave up.”\nThe Yamam post added that “as a commander, you led with personal example and paternal tenderness, thinking about others before you thought about yourself.”\nHis relative, Hedva Avraham, wrote on Facebook that a year after his death, “you are missed in every moment, every smile, every family gathering. Our hearts are broken again and again when we remember the person you were — full of love, strength, bravery and endless generosity.”\nShe wrote that Bar was “not just a brave Yamam fighter, but also an incredible person. Not just on the battlefield, but also in life itself, with your huge heart and your love for Noshi [Ayelet], your family, your friends and everyone you knew. You were always there for everyone, ready to give of yourself without asking anything in return.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Regev Amar, 20, a soldier in the Paratroopers Brigade, from Kibbutz Sde Nehemia, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas attack on Kibbutz Kissufim.\nThe morning of the attack, Regev and his comrades were in the middle of a squad commander’s course with the Bismalach Brigade at a base next Yeruham, but were immediately called into action.\nThey arrived in the area around 9 a.m. and engaged in several battles with Hamas gunmen at junctions near the Gaza border. They headed toward the area of Nahal HaBesor park, continuing to engage in gun battles along the way.\nThe team then arrived at Kibbutz Kissufim and engaged in heavy gunfire with the Hamas terrorists who had invaded the kibbutz. Regev was shot three times, and according to his family, his comrades wanted to try and rescue him but he told them not to risk their lives in doing so. He died shortly afterward, alongside Staff Sgt. Adam Agmon, Staff Sgt. Omri Peretz, Sgt. Bar Yankilov, Sgt. Lavi Buchnik and Sgt. Matan Malka.\nRegev was buried in Sde Nehemia on October 12. He is survived by his parents, David and Gilanit, and his sisters Roni and Shaked.\nBorn in the US, Regev moved to Israel with his parents when a year old after they completed their time stationed there as emissaries and settled in Kibbutz Sde Nehemia in the Upper Galilee.\nThere, middle-child Regev grew up surrounded by animals, streams and many friends, according to an IDF eulogy. An inquisitive child who was always thirsty for knowledge, he attended schools in the nearby Kfar Blum.\nHe played water polo for many years, and loved to travel around the country, bouncing from Eilat to the Golan Heights and the Dead Sea, his loved ones said. He explored nature and knew how to identify animal tracks, plants, insects and constellations.\nAfter finishing high school, Regev did a year of national service at the Ein Gedi field school, during which he served as a tour guide.\nHe enlisted in the IDF in December 2021, beginning training in the elite Shayetet 13 naval force, although after 10 months he was dropped from the course. He then spent several months in the Duvdevan commando unit before settling in the Paratroopers Brigade as a Negevist.\nJust a couple of months before he was killed, Regev began a squad commander’s course. He dreamed of later completing an officer’s course, eventually studying medicine and returning to the army as a commander, his family said.\nHis mother, Gilanit, told a local news outlet that Regev’s father picked his name, which means a patch of land, years before he was born, “and Regev did have a connection to the land and to the country. A very strong connection.”\nGilanit said that while he had a challenging childhood, his time playing water polo really changed him, “and he blossomed from a skinny boy into a large man, strong and sturdy. He was always surrounded by friends. He was always the center of things in the kibbutz and later as a volunteer. When anyone needed help they would call Regev.”\nShe said her son was a “brilliant child” who completed many more majors in high school than he needed to, focusing on math, physics, Bible and geography, “for his soul and also for the future. He was full of knowledge. A genius. The salt of the earth.”\nGilanit said Regev had many dreams for the future: “When he was in high school he said he wanted to be the next IDF chief of staff. When he grew up he said he wanted to be the next prime minister. In the army he wanted to become an officer, it was important to him. He said that his goal was to lead and educate the next generation of soldiers.”\nAfter the army she said, he dreamed of studying medicine and had already started studying for the matriculation exam: “Regev was a man with values and an ideology. In 21 years he managed to do what people don’t get to in 70 years. An incredible boy who became an angel.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 40 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

Ben and Or left the site of the festival via car, but jumped out to try and hide in the forest near the highway when they realized they were under attack.\nBen and Or were both slain along the side of the highway. His family searched for him near the festival and in local hospitals before they were informed that his body had been identified.\nHe was buried in Tzippori on October 10. He is survived by his parents, Nirit and Eran, his younger siblings Ravid and Liron and his girlfriend Liel.\nThe oldest in his family, Ben was born in Afula and lived in his early years in Nazareth Illit (Nof Hagalil), according to an online memorial page.\nWhen he was 7, his family moved to Tzippori, a small town in the Lower Galilee, where he attended school in nearby Givat Ela and later Nahalal, enjoying the rural life, especially riding his bike around the community.\nThe son of a prominent karate instructor, Ben trained under his father from age 4 until he enlisted in the IDF, working his way up over the years to earn a black belt and even spent time overseas with his father training. He also played the drums, and as a teen started working in restaurants to earn money.\nAfter graduating high school, Ben enlisted in the IDF, serving in the 7th Armored Brigade in the Armored Corps. Following his release, he moved to Eilat to work in security at hotels in the city.\nA year before he was killed, Ben returned to the Jezreel Valley and lived with his girlfriend Liel in Kibbutz Hanaton, working in sales.\nHis father, Eran, told a local news site that Ben “loved to dance and loved festivals. At the same time, he worked 12 hours a day because he really wanted to earn money to provide himself with a good life.”\nEran said Ben “was very happy. In recent years he was out all the time. He had many friends. He really lived in the full sense of the world. He was very spontaneous, always going with the flow.”\n“Ben wouldn’t want our home to fall apart or for us to fall into an abyss of mourning,” added Eran. “If he could, he would tell me that I need to keep taking care of his little sister, his brother and Mom. So I do everything I can, but it’s hard. Ben was so dominant, his presence was so significant.”\nBen’s girlfriend, Liel, wrote on Instagram a month after he was killed that she was still desperate “to wake up with you every morning and go to sleep with you every night, to add more photos to the album in my phone full of pictures of your sleeping.”\nLiel said that she was “never at the level of happiness in my life as when I was happy with you – it really felt like a dream because it was so good.”\n“I want to say thank you for taking care of me,” she added. “You were always my balance… always made sure I wasn’t lacking anything, you made me into a happy person, you are a man that every woman could only dream of.

    "story": "Sgt. Ron Sherman, 19, a COGAT soldier, from Lehavim, was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7 from his army base next to the Erez Crossing. He died in captivity and his body was brought back to Israel in December 2023.\nRon’s family said the morning of the attack he was on the phone with his mother before they got cut off, and he switched to sending WhatsApp messages. At 7:12 a.m., Ron wrote: “That’s it, Mom, they’re here, it’s over, I love you.”\nBut hours later the family came across Hamas videos showing him bound in the back of a pickup truck after being kidnapped. Ron’s comrades, Staff Sgt. Or Malka, Sgt. Emil Samoylov and Cpl. Lidor Mekayes were killed on the base on October 7, while Ron, Cpl. Nik Beizer and Sgt. Tamir Nimrodi were taken hostage alive.\nOn December 14, 2023, IDF troops recovered Ron’s body from a tunnel in northern Gaza along with those of Nik and Elia Toledano. Tamir is believed to still be held hostage.\nAn IDF investigation published in September 2024 revealed that Ron, Elia and Nik were killed on November 10, 2023, as a result of a “byproduct” of an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip, likely indicating that they suffocated or were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning inside a tunnel. Ron’s family said he had asthma and needed an inhaler.\nRon was buried on December 15, 2023, in Lehavim. He is survived by his parents, Maayan and Alexander and his siblings Dan and Eden.\nBorn in Petah Tikva, Ron grew up in Lehavim, a small town north of Beersheba. He attended high school in the nearby Eshel HaNasi youth village.\nThe oldest child of two veterinarians, Ron was a major animal lover, and was raised in a house full of pets, including many dogs and cats. His family said he was a huge soccer fan and loved to travel around the world, and was extremely competitive and very charismatic.\nHe enlisted in the IDF in December 2022, just 10 months before he was kidnapped. Due to his asthma, he was not able to serve in a full combat role.\n“You gave us 19 years of pride and happiness,” his father, Alex, said at his funeral. “We saw you emerge into the world and from your very first moment you filled your surroundings with light. You grew up from a dreaming and sensitive child into an impressive young man, smart with a captivating smile and always surrounded by friends.”\nAlex said that Ron “succeeded in everything you set your mind to and you had dreams that you undoubtedly would have achieved, if your life had not been cut short in such a tragic and horrible manner.”\nAmid the family’s pain, he said, “we will try to remember you with the smile and the mischievous and confident expression that so characterized you. You came back to us Ron, it’s over. You’re home. In our hearts.”\nHis younger brother, Dan, wrote on an Instagram memorial page that the world is “a cruel place that doesn’t allow pure and good people like you the opportunity to grow, to accomplish their dreams, to build a family.”\nDan said Ron was “an incredible person, loved by so many friends, smart, opinionated and funny. I can’t imagine my life without you, and the fact that you can’t continue your life, because I know it would have been incredible.”\nHe said that just a few days before Ron was kidnapped, “you played with me on the new PlayStation and I felt that we had gone back to playing like when we were kids.

    "story": "Sgt. Ofir Yeruchin, 19, a soldier with the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, from Givat Shmuel, was killed on October 9, 2023, battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nOfir and his comrades were stationed at a small IDF outpost near Kibbutz Erez when the Hamas onslaught began. Together they fought back against the Hamas invaders for hours, managing to prevent them from conquering the base. His comrade, Sgt. Yaron Zohar, was killed by mortar fire.\nOfir was killed two days after the start of the attack while at the outpost right next to the border.\nHe was buried Petah Tikva on October 12. He is survived by his parents, Dina and Yaron, and his siblings Nadav, Aviv and Ella.\nBorn and raised in Givat Shmuel, outside Tel Aviv, Ofir was a huge soccer fan, including supporting the Israel national team as well as his beloved Barcelona.\nHe studied the Capoeira martial art for many years, and also played the drums, his family said, and also loved playing FIFA video games.\nAfter finishing high school, Ofir enlisted in the IDF in December 2022 and served in the Golani Brigade.\nHis younger sister, Ella, wrote on Instagram that she is always looking at photos of Ofir “and remembering our moments together and smiling and then remembering that there won’t be any more of those, moments where you just say one word out of nowhere and we burst out laughing until our stomachs and cheeks hurt, where we watch Barca games together and you get annoyed and almost break something… when you come home from the army and tell us stories that are so funny that you don’t manage to speak and we’re all laughing before we even heard the story. I want all those moments back and I want you back.”\nOfir’s girlfriend, Gal Almog, wrote online that he was “always the best, the most handsome, the most successful… we loved each other so much, all the time and greatly. Everyone felt it, everyone knew that you and I were forever. You were the best boyfriend I could ask for myself, perfect for me, suited for me exactly and completing me in everything — everything I wasn’t, you were.”\nGal said Ofir “wasn’t afraid of anything, you were the bravest of anyone. You’re my hero. You always told me that deep inside, I know what to do. My love, I don’t know what to do when you’re not by my side. I feel so lost. You promised me you would take care of yourself, for me and for your mom, that’s what you said, and I’m sure that you did so until your last moment.”\nA month after he was killed his mother, Dina, wrote on Facebook that all she wanted in life was to be a mother, “to raise this magic called Ofir, a frenzied child full of reddish curls and laughter, mischievous and happy, always in motion, to get excited with you when you were happy and to be pained with you when something didn’t go right (even when your soccer team lost).”\nDina said her dreams were to “see you grow every day, turn from a child into a teen into a handsome man whose smile doesn’t leave his face, to smell you and to hug and kiss you, to do your laundry to make the food you love, to spoil you and to give.”\nA few months before he was killed, she said, “when you were lying in bed playing FIFA, I lay next to you and asked you want you want to do when you’re released from the army, and you said without thinking that you want to be a drummer, a drummer in a band, and without thinking twice I said, ‘Go for it, I’m with you.'”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 43 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Kraisorn “Ting” Thumyoma, 29, an agricultural laborer from the Bueng Kan province of northeastern Thailand, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Alumim on October 7.\nWhen the rocket fire began, Kraisorn and most of the other Thai workers ran for their nearby bomb shelter.\nHearing voices outside, they thought they were IDF soldiers, but they soon realized that they were Hamas terrorists. One Thai survivor from Alumim told Human Rights Watch that a Hamas member asked one of them where he was from, and “when the guy said he was Thai and not the boss, the soldiers just started shooting nonstop while shouting, ‘Allahu akbar!’”\nAnother survivor said that before one of the terrorists threw a grenade into their living quarters, he shouted, “Hello Thailand,” and then in Hebrew, “You like to work so hard, now you will die.”\nIn total, 22 Thai and Nepalese workers were killed in Alumim that day, including Tianchai Yotthongdee, Ashish Chaudhary, Thawatchai Saetao and cousins Dua and Somchai Sae-yang, while others were kidnapped to Gaza.\nKraisorn’s remains were returned to Thailand on November 9. His cremation ceremony was held on November 14 in the Tha Sa-at subdistrict of Seka District in Bueng Kan Province.\nHe is survived by his wife, Somboon Hnoowieng, their son, and other relatives.\nKraisorn arrived in Israel to work in agriculture in February 2021, signing on for the typical five-year contract. The day he left for the airport, he wrote on Facebook: “In 5 years and 3 months, let’s meet again.”\nOver the years, he worked in farms in a number of communities in the south, starting with picking potatoes in Ohad, not far from the Egyptian border, and eventually harvesting squash and watermelon in Kibbutz Alumim.\nKraisorn documented his work and leisure activities across social media, sharing frequent Facebook updates and images of his daily life. He posted photos and videos of work in the fields, meals shared with his fellow workers and travels around Israel on his days off.\nAt times he expressed joy in the work and the environment, and at other times bemoaned the long hours and difficult labor.\nOn October 7, 2023, at 9:34 a.m., Kraisorn shared one last Facebook post: A video of sirens and Iron Dome interceptions.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Sgt. First Class Shalom Orel Alon, 23, an officer in the Israel Police’s coordination of enforcement operations unit, from Kiryat Ata, was killed battling the Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7.\nOrel had only returned home early that morning from police activity in Jerusalem, but with the start of the attack he hurried out to join his comrades in the fighting. He arrived first in Sderot, where they engaged in gunfire with a number of Hamas gunmen.\nOrel then headed toward the hard-hit Kibbutz Be’eri. He entered the kibbutz with seven other police officers and a civilian, in two armored jeeps.\nThey were ambushed almost immediately by Hamas gunmen, and seven of the eight police officers were killed after RPG and later gunfire hit their vehicles.\nOrel was slain alongside Chief Supt. Avi Amar, Supt. Dan Ganot, Supt. Vadim Blih, Sgt. First Class Mulugeta Gadif, Sgt. Maj. Boris Danilov, Sgt. 1st Class Dor Mangadi, Master Sgt. Eliran Abergel and civilian Ziv Shopen.\nHe was buried in Kiryat Ata on October 12. He is survived by his parents, Tali and Eli, and his four sisters Koral, Noya, Mori and Esther.\nOrel was born and raised in Kiryat Ata where he attended local schools and was a good student, according to a police eulogy. A huge soccer fan, he rooted for the Maccabi Haifa team and also played with a local club.\nHe was a huge fan of the Israeli musician Ravid Plotnik, even tattooing some of his lyrics on his body, including: “Walking in blind faith and creating a new reality.”\nAfter finishing high school, Orel enlisted in the IDF and served in the Givati Brigade’s Shaked Battalion, taking part in many West Bank operations and also breaking his arm in one incident.\nOrel decided that he wanted to continue a security career and join the police, with his sights set on the elite Yamam counter-terror unit. Since he didn’t think they would take him at such a young age, he decided to first gain experience in the coordination of enforcement operations unit, singing up in March 2023, just six months before he was killed.\nHis girlfriend, Noa, wrote on a memorial page that the pair “were so close even in our thoughts, we dreamed the same dreams at night, we aspired to the same achievements, we were different but similar, soulmates.”\nNoa said the phrase “‘guardian angel’ gained new meaning during our time together. Without a doubt we were blessed to have each other, to love and be loved, pure and unconditional love,” she said. “We managed to do and go through in a year and a half what couples don’t manage in 10 years… You’ll always be a hero because you were a hero before, my hero.”\nHis mother, Tali, told a local news site, “The moment Orel was born I felt that a piece of my heart was torn out and attached to him. We had an incredible connection and a huge love for each other.” Tali said she always thought that she would one day lose her son, even seeking therapy to deal with her fears. When he finished his IDF service she was relieved, she said, and tried to dissuade him from joining the police force.\n“We had an inexplicable connection, we would communicate with our eyes,” she said. “I think the fear of losing him was because he was so special and close to me… I think maybe because I had him for such a short time, our connection was so unique, so he could get as much from me as possible.”\nOrel, she said, “loved this country and fought for it with pride.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Maor Rafael Shalom, 46, a retired Shin Bet agent, from Arugot, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nThough Maor had retired from the Shin Bet a year earlier, he still served as a reservist with an extra-military unit within the Defense Ministry.\nWith the start of the attack, Maor headed toward the front lines and joined up with three other fighters, battling in a number of communities before arriving in the hard-hit Kibbutz Kfar Aza, according to an online memorial page.\nThere they joined up with a group of combat soldiers who were trying to counter the heavy Hamas gunfire and together headed to rescue civilians. They spotted a cell of four terrorists and managed to kill three of them, and Maor exited the jeep in order to get a better angle. He was hit with heavy gunfire from hidden Hamas gunmen and was killed.\nMaor was buried in Kfar Ahim shortly before his 47th birthday. He is survived by his wife, Hila, their three children, Yair, Barak and Sahar, his parents, Sima and Shlomo and his siblings Naomi, Boaz and Yehonatan.\nMaor began his service in the Shin Bet in 2000, according to a eulogy from the intelligence agency.\nThe Shin Bet eulogy said that over the years Maor “dealt impressively with significant changes, gained experience and served in a number of challenging positions, both operational and managerial while maintaining a steadfastness and an uncompromising execution of his role.” Maor, it said, was “humble, authentic, attentive, tolerant and empathetic… with deep-rooted Zionist values, he was a role model to many.”\nIn 2022, Maor retired from active service with the Shin Bet, in order to spend more time with his family and be more active in his community, but enlisted in a reserves unit connected to the agency.\nHe and his wife and three children made their home in the small community of Arugot outside Kiryat Malachi. Maor was an active volunteer and member in a number of organizations, including as an EMT with United Hatzalah, the Yedidim organization to assist stranded motorists and the Israeli Association of PPC (powered parachute) Pilots.\nThe PPC organization remembered Maor as “doing everything with an endless smile that infected and delighted his copilots in the southern group… To us, Maor was one of a kind, always helping and always looking forward to the next flight.”\nRoi Asraf, who met Maor through Yedidim, wrote on Facebook that through their work, “I was blessed with a great man of kindness, who chased good deeds and helped everyone without hesitation.” Roi said that whenever he asked Maor about his work with the Defense Ministry, “he would say that he was simply a lowly clerk. So much modesty… He gave of his time, his energy out of his love for the land of Israel. He was a man who could be described as the salt of the earth.”\nAt his funeral, a eulogy written by Maor was read out, in which he said, “You don’t need to say too many things about me, I was just one of 8 billion people. Not the most talented, not the most important. I came, I lived, and I will return to dust.”\n“Don’t be sad because of me,” he continued. “I lived a full life with you. Continue to be happy together, because there is so much left in life. If I come up in your memories, I have one final request from you — don’t be sad, just smile.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 46 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

When the attack began they tried to flee the site of the rave but were shot at and split up, with Daniel and Yarden heading together in one direction.\nThey tried to help treat wounded partygoers at the festival and then hid behind a large trash receptacle before deciding to flee and hide elsewhere, where they were both ultimately slain.\nDaniel was buried on October 15 in Holon. He is survived by his parents, Svitlana and Felix and his sister Rita.\nBorn in Tel Aviv, Daniel grew up in Holon, to parents who had immigrated to Israel seven years earlier from Ukraine, according to a municipal eulogy.\nHe attended local schools and loved sports, playing ice hockey, including on the national youth team, reads a state eulogy.\nAfter finishing high school he enlisted in the IDF and served in the Paratrooper Brigade’s reconnaissance battalion, including during his reserve duty. Following his release he headed to South America to travel around the continent, but had to cut short his trip due to the COVID outbreak.\nDaniel was involved in a large number of professional and personal interests. He was a part owner of the Dizzy Frishdon bar in Tel Aviv, a Krav Maga coach, a marketing director with the Issta Sport Group and a burgeoning DJ who loved music festivals and nightlife.\nHe doted on his niece and nephew and was eagerly awaiting the birth of his sister’s third child — who was born two months after he was slain and named Luka Daniel.\nA week after a deadly terrorist attack on a restaurant not far from Dizzy Frishdon on Dizengoff Street, Daniel told the Kan public broadcaster that “what unites us as a nation is that we know how to pick ourselves up quickly and continue with normal life, go back to our day to day.”\nIn a post on Instagram, the bar eulogized “Daniel, our love. Your spirit, your smile, your generosity was and always will be a part of this place. Everyone who met you loved you. How could they not?… Our heart is broken. You were taken too soon.”\nMarking a year since he was killed, Daniel’s father, Felix, wrote on Facebook that “a year has passed and I still can’t believe it happened. As time passes your absence is only greater and greater, I miss you.”\nDaniel’s older sister, Rita, shared on social media the eulogy she read at his funeral, to “my little and beloved brother.”\n“You were always surrounded by friends, I couldn’t walk with you on the street without you knowing everyone who passed,” she wrote. “You had a giant heart that was always concerned first with others and only after with yourself. Even on that cursed Saturday you stopped and helped someone who was wounded in an ambulance even if it meant you were left behind.”\nRita said Daniel had “so many more plans for the future, you always wanted to conquer the world, to do more and more and you weren’t satisfied with just a little… I don’t know how to even begin filling the enormous hole in my heart. It’s true that everything around keeps going as usual, but my children can no longer play with Uncle Danny, and we’ll never meet the girl who would win your heart, our trek overseas, our ski trip and our marathon will remain as dreams.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

He was called up with the start of the Hamas onslaught and was heading towards his base, near Kibbutz Shomria, in order to get armed and head to the front lines for battle.\nOn the way to the base, he encountered a cell of Hamas terrorists at the Ma’on Junction not far from Kibbutz Nir Oz. He was shot in the neck but managed to tie a tourniquet and keep fighting until he succumbed to his wounds. His family was not informed that he was killed until three days later.\nOriel was buried in Kfar Saba on October 10. He is survived by his wife, Nechama, their two children, Ya’ara, 4, and Gefen, 2, his parents, Yael and Tzion and his sisters Shalhevet and Ortal.\nHe also had an adopted sister, Tzipora, with Down syndrome, who died when he was 19.\nBorn and raised in Kfar Saba, he attended local religious Zionist schools, according to a municipal eulogy. From a young age he volunteered with the Magen David Adom ambulance service, and his instructor said he was “one of the outstanding trainees, characterized by humanity and human relations, and a man of values.”\nAfter finishing high school, Oriel enlisted in the IDF in 2013, joining the Paratroopers Brigade, and completed a squad commander’s course and later an officer’s course. He served as a platoon commander, then a deputy company commander and later a company commander in a number of positions.

He opened the door and a wave of light came inside. He looked for a moment like an angel.”\nHis sister, Ortal, said at a memorial that her brother was all about “giving to others. Oriel was a great man of small deeds that are expected of all of us, but we all know it’s hard to do them… He did so many things that other people don’t do,” she said, including always calling loved ones for their birthdays and memorializing the fallen. “It was important to him that in every family trip, we would visit a memorial, he always said that we are here thanks to those who are no longer with us.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Ilan Eliyahu Moshe-Yaakov, 29, from Tel Aviv, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHe attended the rave with his cousin, Jenny Nisimboim, who was also slain that day.\nAt 6:32 a.m., Ilan uploaded an Instagram post from the rave showing the rocket fire, saying: “The State of Israel, I love you despite everything, despite all the rockets and the sirens. There’s nowhere like the State of Israel, we’ll never give up, ever, we’ll never give up on our independence, on our life.”\nAt 9:12 a.m., he had a conversation with his manager at a youth center where he worked to discuss unlocking the center’s bomb shelter. Shortly before 10 a.m., Jenny told friends that she thought Ilan had been shot, and that was the last anyone heard from them.\nHis family searched for any sign of him for days, including heading down to the festival site and locating his car and his bag, but nothing else. After five days, Ilan’s body was identified.\nHe was buried in Tel Aviv on October 12. He is survived by his parents, Marina and Efim, and his siblings Neta, Roy and Tal.\nBorn and raised in Tel Aviv, the second-oldest in the family, Ilan attended schools in the city although often favored social gatherings over schoolwork, according to a state eulogy.\nToward the end of high school, Ilan realized he wanted to boost his profile before enlisting in the army, and did a year of national service through the Aharai youth leadership initiative. Through the organization he spent a year in Hadera working with middle school children.\nIlan then enlisted in the IDF and served in the elite Duvdevan commando unit. Following his release, he toured around the world, visiting close to 40 countries, his loved ones said.\nUpon his return to Israel, he began to work at a youth center in the Hatikva neighborhood of south Tel Aviv, including patrolling the area at nights and convincing at-risk youth to get off the streets. He advanced to become director of the center and became a well-known figure in the neighborhood. Ilan was running for a spot on the Tel Aviv city council on the list of Mayor Ron Huldai’s party, in the elections that were originally slated for October 2023.\n“Ilan was a man of good deeds,” wrote Huldai on Facebook. “He influenced thousands of youth who were privileged to encounter his values and his abilities, and got to have a big brother to accompany them in important moments of growing up.” Huldai said that Ilan’s “action and commitment to the city burned in his bones, and he recently joined my Tel Aviv 1 faction in the municipal elections to deepen his influence.”\nDuring his six years working at the youth center Ilan also completed a bachelor’s degree in Jewish history and politics at the University of Haifa and intended to pursue a master’s degree in politics. He was a devoted fan of the Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team, loved travel and extreme sports and doted on his niece and nephew.\n“He was a boy with very very high morals,” his mother, Marina, said in a memorial video. “I knew I had a special son, I knew I had an angel, I knew everything, but I didn’t know about the intensity.”\nHis sister, Neta, wrote on Instagram in December 2024: “My Ilanchik, you are with me all the time, in every letter I write, in the park named for you, in my morning shake, in my solitude, in the sunrise, while crying about life, in the big laughter despite everything… I hate missing you so much, it hurts my soul.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 49 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Avraham Nerya Cohen, 20, an off-duty soldier in the Gaza Division, from Jerusalem, was killed on October 7 at the Supernova music festival.\nAvraham, who was part of the production team for the rave, was hugely excited for the Supernova festival, sharing posts on social media in anticipation, including a post with the lineup of DJs, writing on October 3, 2023: “This Friday it’s happening!”\nA day earlier he shared a post on Facebook about the festival, tagging Eliyahu Berenshtein, Elkana Bohbot, and Michael and Osher Vaknin. Avraham, Eliyahu, Michael and Osher were murdered at the festival and Elkana was taken captive, and remains a hostage in Gaza.\nAvraham’s sister said that he, Eliyahu and one of the Vaknin twins tried to leave the site of the rave via car and were shot dead by Hamas terrorists.\nHe was buried on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem on October 12. His family finished the weeklong shiva mourning period on what would have been his 21st birthday.\nAvraham is survived by his parents, Ilanit and Refael, and his siblings Ben, Chen, Hodaya and Yitzhak. On the same day he was slain, his 19-year-old cousin, Sgt. Matan Abergil, was killed fighting in Kibbutz Nir Am. Their funerals were just two hours apart.\nBorn in Hashmonaim, Avraham was raised largely in Lod and lived for the last years of his life in Jerusalem, at a home for lone soldiers.\nHe began his military service in February 2021 and was slated to be released just a couple weeks after he was slain.\n“Avraham, you were plucked from us at the start of your life, just before you were supposed to finish your army service, and you left us shocked and unable to accept that this is real,” wrote his brother, Ben, on Instagram.\n“You had such a huge joy for life that you never let anything hurt you,” Ben continued. “No matter the situation, you would always play music and smile and go with the flow. And I, in my stupidity, didn’t understand how right your path was, and I would ask you why you weren’t serious. I remember you’d always say, ‘everything is good, my brother, go with it.'”\nBen said Avraham “managed to take everything with ease and at the same time to get ahead in life more than I had at your age. And now I understand that I was wrong and you were right.”\n“I’m sorry we didn’t spend more time together, that we didn’t talk enough, that I didn’t worry about you enough, that I didn’t hug you enough, and that I wasn’t there for you in the final moments of your life,” he added. “Thank you for 21 years of memories with you, thank you for 21 years that I was privileged to be your big brother, it’s the biggest gift I ever received.”\nMarking a year since he was killed, Avraham’s mother, Ilanit, wrote on Facebook how it has been “a year that we didn’t speak, a year that I didn’t get any messages from you, a year that I didn’t make food for you.”\n“A year that you didn’t seek advice from me nor I from you. A year that I didn’t wake you up in the morning for work, or you could say argued with you to get up,” wrote Ilanit. “A year that we didn’t argue — I even miss our fighting and yelling. A year that we didn’t work out together after you came home from work.”\n“Don’t leave me, I miss you so much and the signs you leave me are so important — they can’t disappear, it’s the only thing that is keeping me going,” she continued. “I promise I’ll continue to memorialize you everywhere in the world, so that nobody will forget your name, your values, the justice you wanted in the world.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Uriel Avraham.\nHe was buried in Beersheba on October 10. He is survived by his wife, Natalia, their three children, Steven, Romi and Daria, his parents, Eleanora and Igor and his sister Ileana.\nBorn in Belarus, Alexy moved with his family to Israel in 1995, at age 11, according to a police eulogy.\nIn 2002, after finishing high school, Alexy enlisted in the IDF, serving in a combat role. Following his service he decided to continue a career in security, joining the Israel Police in 2008.\nAlexy served in the Yasam Negev patrol unit dedicated to ensuring order and dispersing riots in the Negev region. He and his wife Natalia raised their three children in Beersheba, and loved ones described him as a caring family man, who enjoyed taking the family on camping trips as well as vacations in Israel and abroad.\nHis comrade, Yoram Ben Hemo, wrote on a memorial page that he “had the privilege of working with you for many years.”\n“A hero of Israel, because of you yelling into the radio on that terrible morning to come to you in Re’im via Ofakim and not via Kibbutz Sa’ad, you saved our lives, the whole team,” he added. “I joined you in the battle in Re’im and if only we could have done something different in the fight. I miss you, watch over us from above.”\nHis son, Steven, wrote on social media that Alexy’s name “is being spoken about everywhere. My Dad. No word can describe the longing the whole family feels for you. We will always remember you, you were a hero and you always will be, and the whole country will remember you, I promise!”\nSteven later wrote on Instagram to his father: “I love you to the moon and back. How lucky I am to have had a father so special that I miss you this much. As much as I hate not having you around, I’m happy to know you’re at peace, a better place. You may not be with me anymore and it hurts, oh dear God how it hurts. But my love for you will never die.

They made it to the Mefalsim Junction, where Hamas terrorists fired an RPG at their vehicle and all four of them were killed.\nShalev was buried in Ahuzat Barak. He is survived by his parents, Lizet and Tzvika, and his twin brother Asaf.\nHe grew up in the small town in the north, near Afula, standing out with his signature reddish blonde hair and blue eyes. He loved nightlife and music festivals, finding freedom dancing to trance music.\nShalev had a strong connection to Latin culture, spoke fluent Spanish, listened to Latin music and spent time traveling in Colombia, his family said. He loved to cook with his mother and watch soccer with his father, according to a memorial video.\nIn high school, he was diagnosed with epilepsy, but he refused to let it get him down and was always pushing himself toward success, his family said. He was working at Marom Dolphin, which produces military gear for the IDF, and he was slated to start a degree in project management shortly after he was killed.\nRotem Adom, a family friend, wrote on Facebook that “biologically we’re not siblings, we were born to different mothers in different parts of the country, but in feelings, we are completely. You and Asaf are my little brothers in every way.”\nRotem said that since Shalev was killed, “a piece of our heart has been taken and we have to learn to live with a perforated heart.

Only God knows how much I miss you, they took half of me, from my heart and my body and my thoughts and everything. You’re my twin brother and you’ll stay my twin brother forever.”\n“I already have so much to tell you on our birthday, and I promise you that you’ll be proud of me,” he added. “I love you my brother, a true and honest and pure love.

    "story": "Roi Moshe, 36, from Ashkelon, was killed by Hamas terrorists on October 7 while trying to return home.\nRoi, a firefighter, served as deputy team chief in the Beersheba station, and was posthumously granted the rank of first sergeant major.\nHe had just wrapped up an overnight shift and was headed home when the Hamas attack began. He was ambushed by Hamas terrorists near the Gevim Junction outside Sderot, tried to flee into a nearby field and was murdered.\nHe is buried in Ashkelon on October 10. He is survived by his wife, Linor, their two children, Daniel, 9, and Harel, 7, and their daughter, Gili, who was born in January 2024, three months after her father’s death. He is also survived by his parents, Nitza and Binyamin, and six siblings, Meital, Moran, Adir, Kfir, Liel and Matanel.\nThe oldest in his large family, Roi grew up in a religious home, attending religious schools before enlisting in the army, completing an officer’s course and later attending a yeshiva.\nRoi and Linor met in 2011 when she was in the army and he was serving in reserve duty in the Givati Brigade. Though they came from very different backgrounds, they overcame their differences and wed in 2013, welcoming two children into the world. Linor then had two miscarriages, she told Maariv, and Roi was so excited at the prospect of their third child, picking out Gili as her name and swearing Linor to secrecy.\nRoi joined the Israel Fire and Rescue Services in 2018. At his funeral, Itzik Oz, the commander of the southern district, described Roi as “active, dedicated, brave, an excellent firefighter and a guy with a sense of humor who made sure to keep the shift united, a true friend, an intelligent guy, professional, caring and ambitious.”\nHis younger brother, Matanel, told a local news site that Roi chose to work in Beersheba instead of in Ashkelon “because there’s more work in Beersheba. He really wanted to work, [there] it’s like an elite unit for firefighters because they’re responsible for the whole Negev. There’s action, he didn’t like to sit back and do nothing.”\nRoi, he said, “was always like that. Even when we’d get the house ready for Shabbat, everything was quick and efficient.” Matanel noted that Roi was older than him by 16 years, “and he was also a brother, also a father figure, also a friend, he was everything. He raised me, raised us, all the siblings — he raised us his whole life. He was always there with his knowledge, with his life experience, he was super smart.”\nRoi’s wife, Linor, told Kan public radio that her husband was “a professional, he did this job out of a sense of mission.”\nShe said he was in the middle of studying engineering when he decided to switch paths, telling her, “‘I need to be active, I can’t sit in an office, I need to save people, to do something with my life,'” she recounted. “Roi was a man of action. He was an entire world… he was just light. Full of generosity.”\nAfter he was shot, Roi managed to send a voice note to Linor, telling her that he loved her, loved the kids, asking her to take care of them, to move on with her life, adding: “You’re my queen and I know I can rely on you.”\nLinor told Ynet that when he sent the message, “He was already wounded, he knew it was the end. That was my Roi — he gave me a loving and romantic end, that will stay with me for the rest of my life.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

He is survived by his parents, Tatiana and Peter, sister Irena and brother Artiom.\nBorn in Ukraine, he moved with his family to Israel in 2007, at age 5, settling in Afula. He attended schools in Migdal HaEmek and in Afula, focusing his studies on electrical engineering, according to a local paper.\nHis family members were active in the world of competitive boxing, with his father a coach and his brother an athlete competing for Israel, and the city of Afula dedicated a boxing gym bearing his name in his memory.\nAfter finishing high school, Alex enlisted in the IDF in June 2021, serving in the Technology and Maintenance Corps.\nA friend from school told the local paper that the pair shared a lot of dreams, including traveling together to Japan, “a dream for the two of us that will no longer come true.” The friend said Alex was “a regular at my house, he was like a brother to me.”\n“In 9th grade, I had cancer and missed school and Alex was always there for me,” he recounted. “In the past year in the army, he told me how much he loved this country and the army and aspired to enroll in an officer’s course, and his commanders were also fighting for him to do so and giving him support.”\nHis cousin, Yulia, wrote on Facebook, “My dear cousin, may your soul rest in heaven.

We both knew that this was it, that we were set.”\n“Alex was the love of my life and I was the love of his life,” wrote Romi. “A pure person who everybody loved. A part of me.

One Thai survivor from Alumim told Human Rights Watch that a Hamas member asked one of them where he was from, and “when the guy said he was Thai and not the boss, the soldiers just started shooting nonstop while shouting, ‘Allahu akbar!’”\nAnother survivor said that before one of the terrorists threw a grenade into their living quarters, he shouted, “Hello Thailand,” and then in Hebrew, “You like to work so hard, now you will die.”\nIn total, 22 Thai and Nepalese workers were killed in Alumim that day, including Ashish Chaudhary, Thawatchai Saetao and cousins Dua and Somchai Sae-yang, while others were kidnapped to Gaza.\nTianchai posted on Facebook on October  7, 2023, at 8:53 a.m.: “May the power of the Great Buddha protect and keep all Thai people safe, amen.” That was his final post.\nHis family was informed of his death on October 18. His body was not returned to Thailand for his funeral until November 16.\nHe is survived by his wife, Narisara Malee, their two children, ages 11 and 7, and his parents, Thanakorn and Ranjan.\nHis family said he had been working in agriculture in Israel for more than two years, making much more money than he would at home, and sending most of his earnings back to support his family.\nA day before the attack, Tianchai posted photos and videos of himself and his friends – including Somchai – eating together, singing and goofing around at Alumim, writing, “I’m just relaxing on my day off.”\nOn September 25, 2023, Yom Kippur, he posted a photo of Thai workers hanging out and wrote, “holiday meeting.” He regularly posted to Facebook and TikTok documenting his life working on the farm as well as relaxing and exploring Israel on weekends.\nHis wife, Narisara, wrote on Facebook on the day his death was confirmed: “We’ve been together in sorrow and happiness for a long time. Thank you for being a good father and a good head of the family who always takes care of us and sacrifices for us.”\nThe day after his funeral ceremony, she shared a photo of his shrine online and wrote: “All that’s left is for you to take your place.

    "story": "Oleg Lifshitz, 60, of Ashkelon, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while out on a fishing trip on October 7.\nEarly that morning, Oleg set out with his son-in-law, Vitali Logvinchenko, to go fishing at a small reservoir near Kibbutz Ein Hashlosha, a regular pastime for the pair.\nWhen the rocket fire began, they quickly packed up and decided to head to Ashkelon, where a few of their relatives were camping, according to Haaretz. Along the way they were shot at in their car and decided to jump out and hide in the bushes.\nOleg sent a friend their GPS location, at an intersection just outside Kibbutz Rei’m. The pair were both shot dead by Hamas terrorists. Oleg’s body was only discovered days later, and Vitali’s a week after that.\nOleg was buried in Ashdod. He is survived by his wife, Yelena, their three children, Yana, Lilya and Stanislas, and a grandson, Jaroslav.\nOleg was born in Ukraine and attended schools in Kherson, later becoming a teacher, according to a state eulogy.\nHe served in the Soviet Army in the Artillery Corps, specializing in rocket fire. After his release he taught technical studies at a university in Kherson.\nAfter his first marriage ended, Oleg and Yelena wed in 1993, raising their three children in Kherson. In later years Oleg worked as a driver and owned a fleet of buses.\nAt his soul he was an artist, dabbling in drawing, painting and sculpting, and he led a arts and crafts club for children at a community center in Kherson. In his free time, he loved fishing — the hobby he was pursuing just minutes before his death. He also loved spending time outdoors, baking for his family and friends and he doted on his 5-year-old grandson, reading him books in Ukrainian.\nIn 2019, the family moved to Israel but later returned to Ukraine. According to Haaretz, Oleg stayed in Ukraine after the Russian invasion in 2022 in order to care for his elderly parents, but he was arrested by the Russians, held for about a week and tortured.\nAccording to the state eulogy, during the war Oleg helped greatly in volunteer efforts to deliver food to those afraid to leave their houses, hand out bread in the streets and care for the elderly. At the end of 2022, after Kherson was recaptured by Ukraine, Oleg and his family decided to return to Israel, setting in Ashkelon.\nHe worked at a mechanic shop in the city and immediately began to fit in and make friends, putting his years of technical studies to use.\n“Oleg was a happy guy, a kind man who loved to help others and take care of everyone,” read his eulogy. “He had many friends and he was loved by everyone. In Kherson he was well known as a philanthropist, volunteer and donor to many causes. Everyone in the area knew him and his family learned many stories about his activities after his death.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Gavriel Yishay Barel, 22, from Safed, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHe attended the rave with his friend, off-duty soldier Eliasaf Ben Porat. The pair tried to flee the site of the festival but were both shot dead. Their car was later recovered near the Mefalsim Junction.\nHis family searched for any trace of him for more than a week before they were informed that he had been killed.\nGavriel was buried in Safed on October 16. He is survived by his parents, Oshrat and Yair, and his siblings Oriel, Avraham, Sara and Yehuda.\nThe fourth oldest in the family, Gavriel grew up in Safed, attending religious schools, according to a state eulogy.\nAfter finishing high school he enlisted in the IDF and served at the main training base for the Northern Command near Yokneam. Following his release he moved back to Safed and started working in the city.\nHe was a devout fan of the Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team.\n“Gavriel, my brother, my best friend, I still can’t manage to part from you,” his brother, Yehuda, wrote on Instagram. “Every morning that you’re not with us feels like a lifetime. I feel like I’m in some sort of nightmare just waiting for you to return and say it was just one of your jokes.”\nYehuda wrote that he was “not willing to accept that you’ll never come back. I miss you my angel. I hope to one day wake up from this nightmare and hear your laugh at least one more time.”\nGavriel’s aunt, Shaylee wrote on Facebook describing her nephew as “a boy with beautiful eyes, a huge soul and a wide smile.”\n“He had a rare combination of childlike joy and a great love for life, he loved to dance and listen to music, he was very connected to his mother and was always there to provide a shoulder and to help,” she wrote.\nShaylee said that in the period before his death, “he started to ask himself the big questions about life — what he’s looking for and what he wanted to focus on. All his future was ahead of him, and despite his young age he was already started to discover his path.”\nHis mother, Oshrat, shared online the eulogy she read at a ceremony marking a month since his funeral.\n“Gavrieli, you were defined by your dynamism, your desire for freedom and for a good life,” she wrote. “You were a free and happy butterfly, you were endowed with big and stand-out charisma, with a well-developed sense of humor, a joy for life and a constant captivating smile.”\nOshrat said her son’s “energy, combined with your integrity and your love of others drew attention from your surroundings, and your presence could never be ignored. You were a true friend, with a unique personality, multi-faceted.”\nFor Gavriel, “spontaneity was a central value, alongside this you were very practical, logical and smart… Everywhere you went you really brought with you light and joy. You were gifted with sensitivity to your friends, your siblings and most of all toward me. You always tried to lighten the mood, even in difficult situations.”\n“God loaned us an angel as a gift — pure and beautiful outside and inside, with golden hair and blue eyes full of depth and understanding…  You had a fire and a passion to conquer the world.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 58 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Cpt. (res.) Iftach Gorny, 51, a reservist with the LOTAR counter-terror regional Nitzana team, from Be’er Milka, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nThe morning of the attack, Iftach was called up with other members of the rapid-response counter-terrorism team based in the Nitzana bloc of communities on the Egypt border to join the fighting.\nHe was slain battling a cell of Hamas gunmen next to Yated. His comrade, Sgt. Maj. (res.) Liran Mones Almosnino, was killed not long afterward in Kibbutz Holit.\nIftach was buried on October 15 in Kadesh Barnea (Nitzanei Sinai). He is survived by his wife, Sivane, their three children, Negev, Bustan and Sade, his parents, Ilana and Moshe and his siblings Eyal, Tomer and Asaf.\nBorn and raised in Kibbutz Na’an, near Rehovot, Iftach loved spending time out in nature, camping, hiking and bike riding, according to a kibbutz eulogy. He played and later coached basketball, he loved to laugh and play cards and bet on stupid things, his loved ones said.\nDuring his mandatory stint in the military, he served in the elite Sayeret Matkal unit and did reserve duty for many decades afterward. He and his wife, Sivane, were among the founders of Be’er Milka, a small community near the Egyptian border founded in 2006 with just eight caravans, a dirt path and a hookup to water and electricity.\nThere he ran the community’s dairy farm, helping keep the town afloat, and was an integral part of its success and development. After finishing his active reserve duty period, he joined LOTAR Nitzana, which was designed to protect the group of communities near the Nitzana border crossing with Egypt.\nIn an interview with the Israeli Cattle Breeders Association in May 2023, just months before he was killed, Iftach recounted moving to Be’er Milka “without street lights, without a fence, without internet, without phone lines, without sewage. It was an indescribable period, a spiritual uplifting, a great happiness. We were eight families with small children and huge dreams. We didn’t have anything, but we had everything.”\nHis daughter, Negev, wrote on Facebook on what would have been his 52nd birthday, wondering why he wasn’t there.\n“Where are you? Where are you to wake up today and see your birthday table, to take us camping, to play whist or Settlers of Catan or poker or any other game, to cook dinner you loved for all of us and to get excited over the roast beef you cooked for hours in the oven.”\nNegev wondered why her father wouldn’t “enter with your huge smile and your swinging walk, and we’ll just sit and laugh and I’ll tell you how things have been in reserve duty for the past few weeks. Or we’ll bet on something and whoever loses has to do the dishes. And in the end, you’ll wash them anyway… You’re not here, but sometimes you’re here more than you ever have been.”\nIftach’s wife, Sivane, shared on Facebook the eulogy she wrote for the ceremony marking a month since he was killed.\n“Where is my anchor? Where are your strong, warm and safe hands?” she wrote. “And your sturdy shoulders that wrapped me in their warmth. Resting my head on your living, beating heart.”\nSivane wrote, “When I look back, I am filled with gratitude for every moment with you and for every breath in our precious life together. Your physical body, so full of life, strength and warmth, is no longer there. But you are alive and beating in my heart. You are with us in everything. In the wind blowing, in the clouds, in the sunrise, in the birds, in the sand of the dunes, in the sunset, in your starry sky… You are here, in every breath and beat.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Along the way they were ambushed by Hamas gunmen and Hanan was shot and kidnapped. In May 2024, Hanan’s body was recovered by the IDF from Gaza and he was determined to have been killed on October 7.\nShahar called Magen David Adom and said his friends had been shot and they told him how to tie a tourniquet, according to Lior’s mother, who told Ynet that she had received a recording of the phone call. They decided to flee the car and try and hide from the gunfire, and Shahar, Lior, Marsdas and Hila were all murdered.\nShahar was buried in Tzur Moshe on October 12. He is survived by his three children — the youngest of whom was born after he was killed — his fiance Karin, his parents, Liz and Michael, and his sisters Hagit and Koral.\nHe was born and raised in Ra’anana, according to a memorial website, and always brought hordes of friends over to his house. After his studies he served in the IDF, and following his release he traveled around the world, visiting India and Europe before his mother and sister joined him for a period traveling in Thailand.\nShahar had a lifelong love of animals, and a few years before he was killed, he and Lior opened together a horse ranch providing horse rides for adults and kids as well as therapeutic services. A silhouette of a horse was etched into his gravestone.\n“Shahar was a man of nature, full of spirit, freedom and independence,” his sister, Hagit, told a local news site. “He loved horseback riding, loved the sea and was a surfer.”\nShe said even before he opened the ranch a few years ago, “he always loved animals, as a boy he would bring abandoned animals home and raise them… people said that when he entered a room he would bring great light with him.” Since he died, she said, “I have received messages from so many people who said that he helped them during dark times.”\nHis sister, Koral, wrote on Instagram two months after he was killed: “I know, I know that you can see everything from above. I know that you are really here with me, listening and feeling and understanding.”\nKoral said that “nobody and nothing in the world can shake the soul-deep connection that we had. Thank you for giving me the strength to deal with what I am dealing with, thank you for coming to me in my dreams and giving me hints.”\nShe added: “What did you say to me in the last dream? ‘You trust me, right?’ So as always, the answer is yes.

He and his coworkers headed for the nearby bomb shelter when the sirens rang, as they had been taught in such scenarios.\nWhen they heard voices outside, they assumed it was IDF soldiers coming to rescue them. So the group of six walked out of the structure only to encounter around 10 Hamas terrorists.\nThey shot Pongsathorn and his colleague Kiattisak Patee dead on the spot, and took the four others hostage.\n“We shouted, ‘Thailand, Thailand’,” Anucha Angkaew, who was kidnapped and later released, told Reuters. “But they didn’t care.”\nPongsathorn’s body was flown home for his funeral, arriving back in Thailand on October 20. His cremation ceremony was held on October 21. He is survived by his mother and two siblings.\nHis mother, Surangkhana, told the Bangkok Post that she was “shocked and speechless when I heard the news.”\n“I wished for a miracle. I wished him to return home safely. Sadly, there is no miracle,” she said.\nShe said her son had been working on an Israeli farm for a year, hoping to earn more money and build her a new house.\n“I never imagined my son would die like this in a faraway land. Many Thais have worked there, but why did it happen to be my son who was captured and killed?” she said.\nSpeaking to another local news outlet, Surangkhana described her son as “a good-natured person, loud and brash but sincere. His friends love him.”\nShe said he was working in Israel to provide her with a better life, “but if I had a choice, I would rather starve and have my child come home alive.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Ido Somech to fight against the invading Hamas gunmen.\nIt was the first time the tank crew had all worked together, yet they didn’t hesitate, battling against several groups of gunmen crossing the border.

Shay was also killed and his body kidnapped to Gaza — his death was only confirmed in January 2024.\nUltimately the tank was commandeered by two civilian partygoers, Daniel and Neria Sharabi, who took Ariel’s weapon and managed to use the tank to help save dozens of attendees. Ido was the only member of the crew who managed to survive.\nAriel was buried on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem on October 9. He is survived by his parents, Idit and Achiya, and his six younger siblings, Tehia, Atara, Malachi, Shilo, Noam and Ori.\nThe firstborn in the family, Ariel was born in Mitspe Yeriho and grew up there until age 4, when his family decided to spend several years in New York as religious emissaries, according to a municipal eulogy.\nThey returned to Israel for a year before deciding to head back for another four years, finally settling back in Israel when Ariel was 12. He was a devoted Torah scholar, and at his bar mitzvah he made a siyum (completion ceremony) on all of the Mishna, and by the time he was 18 he had completed the entire Talmud.\nFor high school, he attended yeshiva in the Lower Galilee and after finishing he joined the hesder yeshiva in Yerucham. In January 2023, Ariel enlisted in the IDF, joining the Armored Corps after recovering from a shoulder injury.\nAriel loved photography, taking a course to improve his skills. He was musically inclined, playing the violin, enjoyed baking cakes for his friends and loved to hike and travel around the State of Israel, according to an online eulogy.\n“He was sweet,” his father, Achiya, told The Forward. “Unique. And smart. And he loved to learn Torah. He loved Hashem [God].”\nAchiya said his son ran a number of WhatsApp groups, including those that shared moments of joy and thoughts of philosophy as well as one that coordinated jam sessions at public pianos in Jerusalem.\n“He did so many things in his life,” he said. “It’s sad to know that most of these things will not exist anymore.”\nAriel’s mother, Idit, told Israel Hayom that her son started exploring baking while in yeshiva, and together with friends they would bake cakes and cookies to enjoy together for Shabbat.\n“They would buy tons of flour, eggs, they’d sift the flour, check it, check the eggs for blood spots, they’d finish at 1 a.m., finish cleaning up even later,” she told the newspaper. “And what they baked really gave a homemade touch for all of the students in the yeshiva. It was their dessert on Friday nights.”\nHe particularly loved to make alfajores, a South American sandwich cookie, and after his death his loved ones started to bake them in his honor and distribute them with a sticker of the phrase Ariel had made his WhatsApp status: “My cookies  taste better when my friend eats them.”\nIdit said the sticker and the generosity perfectly encapsulate her son’s spirit: “If all of us can be the most happy, can look at those around us and help them, we’ll be in a better world.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 64 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

He was a fan of the Beitar Jerusalem soccer team and was active in his local Bnei Akiva youth group.\nIn a memorial podcast, his younger brother, Yohai, described Eldad as quiet and modest: “He didn’t seek to stand out, he’d find a spot on the side and be with himself.”\nEldad, he said, “gave off only a taste of what was going on inside.” As he began to find himself in work and with his new apartment, Yohai said his brother was “a lot more calm, a lot more peaceful.”\nHis sister, Tali, said in the few months before he was killed, Eldad “started to build himself from scratch… he started to invest in himself.”\nEldad, she said, “worked very hard on his character,” and was very dedicated in particular to respecting his parents.\n“To my mom especially, he always took care of her, if that meant on Friday night pouring her drink, not eating until she started eating, or not even sit down until she had — all these little things,” Tali added.\n“Eldad was very active, very practical, there wasn’t a day he didn’t go out to work — I can’t remember him sitting at home since he was in high school.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Alik Pozdnykov, 38, a detective in the Israel Police’s Magen unit, from Dimona, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas attack on the Supernova music festival.\nThat morning, Alik was on duty as one of the hired police officers working at the festival, where he arrived Friday night.\nHis wife called him with the start of the rocket fire, and he told her “it looks like a war is starting.” At 7:48 a.m. he sent her a selfie and wrote: “I love you guys.”\nAt 8:06 a.m., Alik sent a friend a message saying that he was trying to battle the Hamas gunmen but he had only one bullet left. That was the last anybody heard from him. His wife was informed that evening that he had been killed.\nHe was buried on October 11 in Dimona. He is survived by his wife, Olga, their three children, Michal, 10, Daniel, 7, and Talia, 2, and his seven siblings, Elena, Natasha, Vitaly, Pavel, Sergey, Vyacheslav (Slav) and Denis.\nAlik was born in Bukhara, Uzbekistan, the seventh of eight children in a Jewish family with Polish-Ukrainian roots that fled Nazi persecution, according to an Israel Police eulogy.\nIn 1997, when Alik was 12, his family moved to Israel and settled in Dimona, where he discovered his love of sports and in particular running. His coach got him to move to the Hadassah Neurim Youth Village near Netanya, where he focused on sports, joined the Wingate Institute and represented Israel overseas in the 400m and 800m races.\nIn 2004 he graduated high school and decided to put sports aside in order to join the Border Police, serving in the Yamas covert tactical unit for three years. After his release, he joined a friend working in car sales, and in August 2012 he joined the Israel Police.\nThroughout his service, Alik served in special ops units, and as a combat training instructor and in 2021 he joined the Magen unit, dedicated to combating drug and weapons smuggling on the eastern and southern borders.\nAlik met Olga in 2008 and they married in 2009, and they welcomed their three children in 2013, 2015 and 2020.\n“If he was going to fall in battle, it would be while on duty,” his brother, Slav said in a memorial video. “It was in his soul — his work and his love of the country… He was very, very proud to serve his country.”\nOlga said in the video that “it’s so hard, it’s really hard,” and her youngest daughter still asks when Dad is coming back all the time.\n“Alik was a very good dad, a very good husband, just a good person in general,” she said. “Every minute that he was home, he was with the kids. He’d come home after a shift, sleep for a few hours and then take the kids on a trip, to play, whatever. He was always with the kids.

    "story": "Arik Marziano, 50, a firefighter with the Israel Fire and Rescue Services with the rank of sergeant major, from Sderot, was murdered on October 7 by Hamas terrorists who invaded the city.\nArik, a squad commander at the Sderot station, was slated to begin a firefighting shift that Saturday morning. He was about to leave the house when the rocket sirens began, and after a period in his home’s reinforced room, he decided to head out regardless.\nHe had just arrived at the Sderot station when his daughter told him that he had forgotten a bag of equipment at home — something his family said he never did on any other day. Arik headed back home for the bag, and on the way, his vehicle was hit by an RPG fired by Hamas terrorists. He tried to get out of the car and the terrorists shot him dead on the spot, a murder which was captured on camera.\nHe was buried in Sderot on October 9. He is survived by his wife, Avital, their four children, Koral, Ron, Shalev and Imri, his mother, Sara and his younger siblings Motti, Merav, Efrat and Shmulik.\nBorn and raised in Sderot, Arik attended schools in the city, according to a state eulogy. From a young age, he dreamed of becoming a firefighter and saving lives, evening volunteering with the local fire station starting in middle school.\nAfter graduating high school, Arik enlisted in the IDF, serving as a helicopter technician in the Air Force. Following his release, he completed firefighting school in Rishon Lezion and in 1996 he joined the Israel Fire and Rescue Services.\nOver the next 27 years, he completed a number of additional certifications, including a squad commander’s course, a fire investigator’s course and at age 40, he completed a bachelor’s degree at Beit Berl College.\nIn 1998, he married Avital and they raised their four children in Sderot, where he was an active and engaged father figure, his loved ones said.\n“My dad was a special guy,” his oldest daughter, Koral, told a local Ashkelon news site. “We’ll always remember him that way. We were super connected to him and we were a very united family.”\nKoral said she wanted her father to be remembered “as a wonderful person, a friend to everyone, always helping everyone. He was a hero to kids — he would bring his fire truck to kindergartens, bring the kids to the hose and play with them with the water and the foam. Everyone who knew Dad says only good things about him. I want my future kids to know who their grandfather was.”\nMarking six months since he was killed, Arik’s wife, Avital, wrote on Facebook about no longer “feeling your warm and embracing hug, not seeing your captivating smile while you look at our Imriki, not getting a message from you that puts a smile on my face, not smelling your cologne that has spread throughout the whole room.”\nAvital said all that is left “are good memories and photos of our beautiful moments in every corner. I look into your kind eyes and I cry. My Arik — I miss you so much. What I wouldn’t give to be with you now and feel protected and safe again. To see you pick up Imri and kiss him with crazy amounts of love, to see you laugh and do nonsense with Koral, to see you give a warm hug to Shalev and Ron.”\nShe said she is “ripped apart to know that our children won’t get to experience any more beautiful and important moments with you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

At 7:45 a.m. his wife called him and he said, “I’m busy, I’ll get back to you,” and hung up. That was the last she heard from him.\nHe engaged in a firefight with Hamas gunmen at the Sha’ar Hanegev Junction outside Sderot. Moshael was slain alongside fellow Yamam officers First Sgt. Dror Altun and Sgt. Maj. Bar Sivan.\nHe was buried in Ramle on October 9. He is survived by his wife, Shahar, his parents, Simha and Haim, and his siblings Elior, Yakir, Amit and Lia.\nBorn and raised in Ramle, the second-oldest in the family, Moshael attended local schools and long dreamed of experiencing a meaningful military service, according to a memorial website.\nAfter finishing high school, he enlisted in the IDF in 2009 and served in the Paratrooper’s Brigade.\nFollowing his release, Moshael decided to continue serving the country and in 2013 he joined the Israel Police, serving in the Border Police’s Yamam special ops unit. He underwent special combat training and later training as a bomb sapper and breacher. In 2020 he completed an officer’s course and was then appointed as a team commander in Yamam.\nIn September 2022, Moshael married Shahar, whom he met during his officer’s training. He loved extreme hobbies, enjoying mountain climbing, rappelling, snowboarding and more, according to an online eulogy.\n“Moshael was an amazing child,” his mother, Simha, said in a memorial video. “He did only good wherever he went.”\nShe recalled how he started an initiative to go on Purim with his comrades dressed in superhero costumes and rappel down the sides of hospitals “and knock on the children’s windows and hand out presents. It was very moving.”\nHis sister, Amit, said Moshael was the first she’d call when stressed or troubled. “He knew how to say the right thing and to be there for you,” she said.\nIn a memorial video, Shahar recounted how Moshael proposed inside the Keshet Cave in the Upper Galilee during a rappelling adventure: “We both went down with the ropes and halfway he stopped us, pulled out the ring — he dropped it on his shirt — and then he looked at me with this face of ‘that wasn’t part of the plan.'”\nShahar said that with “all his size, the enormity of him, his big heart, I think ultimately he was a simple guy, smiling, who loved life, loved his job, was prepared to give everything for this country.

    "story": "Maj. Ben Bronshtein, 24, a squadron commander in the Duvdevan commando unit, from Holon, was killed on October 7 while battling the Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Kfar Aza.\nThe morning of the attack, Ben was on break from the army and at his girlfriend’s house. Early that morning he was called up with his comrades and sent to Kfar Aza, one of the hardest-hit kibbutzes along the Gaza border.\nThere, Ben and others battled against the Hamas invaders inside the kibbutz, managing to kill a number of them. Shortly after 11 a.m., Ben was shot directly in the heart, and died moments later, according to an IDF eulogy.\nHe was buried on October 11 in Holon. He is survived by his parents, Miri and Nir, his siblings, Moshiko and Noa and his girlfriend, Adi.\nThe middle child, Ben was born and raised in Bat Yam, attending local schools. He had a great sense of humor and his dimples were always on display, his loved ones said.\nBen loved sports, including bike riding, and in high school, he played basketball with the Maccabi Bat Yam youth team, according to a memorial website. At age 16 he decided to devote himself to his goal of serving in an elite IDF unit, including intensive workouts with CrossFit.\nAfter he finished high school, Ben and his family moved to Holon. In March 2017, Ben enlisted in the IDF and accomplished his dream of serving in the elite Duvdevan commando unit. He completed an officer’s course and then a company commander’s course, before being posted as a company commander in the Givati Brigade’s Shaked Battalion. He then returned to Duvdevan to command a squadron.\nHis family said he was known for a saying he would often repeat to the soldiers in his command: “For the nation to have a normal life, a handful of people have to live an abnormal life.” He would then tell them: “You are that handful.”\nIn a eulogy marking a year since he was killed, Ben’s mother, Miri, said it was hard to believe “that we haven’t spoken for a full year.”\n“A full year that I didn’t burst out laughing with you. A full year that I didn’t seek advice from you. A full year that I didn’t cover you at night,” she continued. “A full year that I didn’t wait for a message from you. A year that I didn’t receive any message from you — ‘Mom, I love you, please don’t worry.'”\nMiri said it had been “a full year that I didn’t brag that your dimples come from me. A year that sibling time isn’t the same, Shiko and Noki’s eyes search for you, maybe today he will surprise us and come? A year that dad doesn’t iron your uniform and kiss it. A full year that you didn’t ask for strawberries and cream — even though it’s not the season. A year that we have to settle for just your smell that remains on your uniform.”\nHis girlfriend of five years, Adi, said in a video tribute on Channel 13, “During all of our years together, you always said to me that you’d rather die a million times than have a civilian get even a scratch.”\n“You loved your job so much, and you did everything to protect your soldiers and the citizens of Israel,” she continued.\n“You were a funny guy who turned every situation into a light and funny one. You loved life so much — loved attractions, what didn’t you try? Skiing a million times, go-karting on the streets of Tokyo, bungee jumping in Colombia,” she said. “You were a person with morals, loving and loved.

    "story": "Omri Yaakov Lavi, 25, from Safed, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nOmri arrived at the festival on Friday evening, which he had been excitedly anticipating for weeks. After the start of the rocket fire, he told his parents that the police were clearing the site of the rave and he was on his way to the car to head out.\nHe and his best friend, Gil Avni, were shot dead next to their vehicle before they could leave the site of the festival. The car was found a few days later, but their bodies were not identified for another several days.\nOmri was buried in Safed on October 13. He is survived by his parents, Hagit and Yitzhak, his siblings Barak and Noa and his girlfriend Inbar.\nBorn and raised in Safed, Omri, the middle child in his family, attended local schools in the city, focusing his high school studies on film, according to a state eulogy.\nHis loves ones said he loved to draw, including graffitiing on walls, played computer games and loved the Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team. He studied martial arts, played basketball and enjoying skateboarding and snowboarding.\nAfter finishing high school, he enlisted in the IDF in 2016, serving in the Golani Brigade, and completing a squad commander’s course. Following his release, Omri worked as a security guard in Safed and later moved in with friends in Ramat Gan and worked as a bartender.\nIn December 2022 he embarked on a grand tour around South America. Just a few months before he was killed, Omri returned to Israel, rented an apartment in Ramat Gan and started working at the Meitav investment house.\nMarking a year since he was killed, his brother, Barak, wrote on Instagram that it was hard for him to contemplate the passage of time, “with an inexplicable feeling that every day in this world without you is like 10 years of suffering.”\n“If you can’t come back, at least send me strength from there, because I promised you that I would accomplish everything for you, and there’s no chance I’m going to lose — you never lost and you’re a part of me, so we’ll never lose!” he wrote.\nBarak said he would make sure “that everybody knows you, we’ll make sure to do so much good and spread so much light — your light. The biggest light in the world. Light that will shine on everyone!”\nOmri’s mother, Hagit, told a local radio station that she wants to remember her son not how he died, “but how he was, a special kid, an angel.”\n“His real life was just starting,” she said. “He had such a sense of humor, that the most depressed person would start laughing around him. There was nobody who spent time with him who wasn’t infected with his smile and the joy for life that Omri had.”\nHagit described him as a “red-headed kid who was one of a kind.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Master Sgt. (res.) Avihay Amsalem, 30, from Hadera, was killed on October 9, 2023, battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nAvichay was called up to reserve duty the morning of the Hamas attack, and left the house to join his comrades down south.\nThough during his mandatory army service he served in the Kfir Brigade, he pushed to later join the 551st “Arrows of Fire” Reserve Paratroopers Brigade, and joined up with his comrades in the commando unit that weekend.\nOn October 9, 2023, Avichay was killed in battle with Hamas terrorists who had holed up in an underground bunker near the Sha’ar Hanegev Junction just outside Sderot. Alongside him, Maj. Eitan Neeman and Cpt. Yuval Halivni were also slain in the exchange of fire.\nHe was buried on October 11 in Hadera. He is survived by his wife, Tal, their two daughters, Talia and Maor, his parents, Ruth and Gavriel and his siblings Shira-Emuna and Liraz.\nSeveral months after he was killed, Avihay’s third daughter, Shahary, was born.\nBorn and raised in Hadera, the youngest of his siblings, Avichay attended elementary school in the city and high school in Kfar Saba, according to an IDF eulogy.\nHe then spent several years studying in the Shavei Hevron yeshiva in Hebron, before enlisting in the IDF where he served in the Kfir Brigade. After finishing his mandatory duty, he and his wife Tal settled in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba so he could continue his yeshiva studies.\nThey then moved back to Hadera and the couple served as live-in parental figures at the Talpiot youth village in the city, where they counseled 12 at-risk youth during their daily life. Avichay was also studying electrical engineering at the Ruppin Academic Center and he worked as an automation engineer at the Elbit defense company.\n“Avichay was a very moral guy, he left behind a lot of values which I teach others about and pass on in conversations,” his father, Gabi, told Ynet. “Values of kindness, of integrity, of excellence — at home, in school, at work and in the army.”\nGabi said his son “always aspired to succeed even more. He got into an elite [reserves] unit and excelled there, and at the same time he was modest and humble. He didn’t brag about any of his achievements, and he had many — in his work at Elbit, in his studies, he never boasted or flaunted them.”\nHis wife, Tal, told Arutz Sheva that deep in her heart she knew that Avihay would not have a long life.\n“When Avichay left the house [on October 7] I knew he wouldn’t come back,” she said. “Avichay was a big person, too good, the kind who don’t return. He always told me that if something should happen to him, I should remarry, and I told him ‘you’re too good for this world. You’ll die young.’ This was part of our conversation, it was something we always talked about.”\nTal noted their work at a youth village for at-risk children, saying they “were like parents for 12 at-risk girls, we lived with them and Avichay was a very significant figure, not just for the kids but for the whole village. He knew what was going on with most of the children there.”\nShe said one Shabbat there they left the synagogue “and all the kids came up to him, and I said to him, ‘You’re the king of the village.’ Everyone was pulled toward him. He had a big soul. He was the best dad to our daughters, the best husband I could ask for.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

The shelter had an automated door that was supposed to electronically unlock when there were rocket sirens in the city, but it malfunctioned that morning, and the group of travelers were stuck outside.\nMoments later, a pickup truck of Hamas terrorists drove by and opened fire on the group, killing all 13 passengers.

They really loved the land of Israel.”\nShe told a women’s magazine that “the Dead Sea was their particular favorite, they enjoyed paddling around in the water.” Irit said the sisters “were planning a trip to Eilat in November and after that a visit to the Upper Galilee.

He is survived by his two children, Hila and Nadav, his partner, Efrat, and his siblings, Amira and Oz.\nIn December 2024, Adi was reburied in Netiv Ha’asara.\nBorn in Ashekon, Adi was raised in Kochav Michael, a small town near Ashkelon. He had trouble focusing in class but was an autodidact who taught himself the subjects he cared about, was opinionated and always seeking adventure, his loved ones said. A redhead in his youth, he loved nature and the outdoors and even had a horse, Paz, he rode to school.\nAfter finishing school, Adi enlisted in the IDF and served in the Paratroopers Brigade as an artillery liaison officer.

They loved to travel around Israel together with their children, enjoying the outdoors, particularly his beloved south, and Adi always loved to cook and feed others.\nHis sister, Amira, wrote on Facebook marking a year since he was killed: “My dear brother, the love of my life — it’s been a year of flowing tears.”\n“A year of pain in my heart, a year of longing with no end,” she added. “There is no day that goes by that I don’t feel how much you are missing.”\nAdi’s partner, Efrat, wrote ahead of Memorial Day 2024 that “the truth is I don’t need a day to remind me of you. You are present and appear in my life daily.”\n“Sometimes it’s in a song that plays on the radio, sometimes someone in a passing car that looks exactly like you, and even in a dream when I was privileged to dream of you,” Efrat continued.\nNevertheless, she said, “You deserve so much for people to honor you and to remember you, even in places you had never been. After all, in every new place you visited, you would succeed in finding a connection with everyone, and the stories would begin to flow with no stopping.”\nIn a post marking a year since he killed, Efrat noted that “the remnants of you I see in your children, Hila and Nadav, who you shaped in your image.

The final time they heard from him was 8 a.m.\nHai and Orel were both murdered inside the shelter when it was attacked by Hamas terrorists who fired inside and threw grenades at the partygoers.\nHai was buried in Kiryat Ata on October 10.

His family said he loved being in the culinary industry and being surrounded by food.\nAbove all, his loved ones said, he was a superfan of the Beitar Jerusalem soccer club — he had a large tattoo of its logo on his back, and the team’s symbol was engraved on his headstone. For Hai, his downtime was for music festivals and dancing, and he could be found partying to music and letting off steam most weekends.\nHis mother, Hedva, told a sports news site that Hai was “a passionate fan of Beitar… He was a happy kid, he had two loves in life — Beitar and dancing, and he was killed at a dance festival.”\n“His love for Beitar was the only thing that interested him… I’m his mom and his big love, and Beitar was his second love,” added Hedva. “His whole room is Beitar scarves, flags, shirts.” She said that his death “is so hard, it’s a huge loss, my son is no longer with me, a flower that was plucked. We’re in shock, we’re stunned, we’re sad.”\nHai’s sister, Eden, wrote on Instagram, “My Hai — you’ll forever remain etched into my soul.”\n“I love you until my bones hurt,” she added. “You were the joy, you were the light, you had the most beautiful smile, and you’re up there spreading your joy, my pure angel.”\nLater Eden wrote that all she wanted was “for you to come back for one moment. Just one more time to sit with you, with a beer on the balcony.

    "story": "Sgt. Amit Guetta, 21, a soldier in the Maglan commando unit, from Rehovot, was killed on October 7 battling the invasion of southern Israel.\nWith the start of the Hamas attack, Amit began to make his way from Netivot toward the Julis IDF base near Ashkelon in order to join his comrades before heading to the front lines. But before he could make it to the base, he was killed by Hamas gunmen along the way.\nLater in the day, his commander, Cpt. Eily Adany and his comrade Staff Sgt. Amichai Vanino were slain fighting in Kibbutz Kfar Aza.\nAmit was buried on October 10 in Rehovot. He is survived by his wife, Gal, his parents, Einat and Avishai, and his four siblings, Gilad, Yonatan, Tamar and Yael.\nAmit’s son, Oz, was born in April 2024, six months after he was killed.\nBorn and raised in Rehovot, Amit attended local religious schools. He played the guitar and was devoted to Torah study and observance.\nAfter finishing high school, Amit studied at the Otzem religious pre-military academy in Nave, near the Egyptian border, before enlisting in the IDF in August 2022. He was placed in the elite Maglan commando unit, ultimately joining the team led by Eily.\nAmit and Gal got married less than four months before he was slain, and settled in Netivot.\nAfter his death, his family printed posters and stickers with a saying they attributed to him: “Never complain — I think those who complain have a flaw in their faith. Because ultimately they are complaining about what God gave them — and everything God does is for the best.”\nRabbi Yaki Weiss, who taught Amit at Otzem, said that “from the moment Amit discovered the hidden treasures in the Beit Midrash [study hall], he never wavered from it. Through his perseverance in studying, his inner self grew and grew, and he was privileged to study for two full years at the academy.”\nAmit and Gal, he added, together held “three lofty values — the light of the Torah, building a faithful home in Israel and a meaningful military service to defend the homeland.”\nAmit’s friend, Lavi Badichi, described him as “a straight arrow, true, humble, with good manners and a true connection to holiness — and the list only goes on.”\nAt the brit mila circumcision ceremony for their son, Oz, Amit’s wife Gal said that she believed “my entire pregnancy is a great miracle, the birth even more so and this little baby is a great light in my life.”\nGal offered thanks “for the hidden and visible miracles that I get to see in my life, for the presence of God and of Amit in complicated situations, spiritually and physically.”\nLater, marking what would have been their first anniversary together, Gal noted that as newlyweds, “when Amit would come home from the army, we would disconnect from everything else and focus just on us. Not out of egoism, but from an understanding of the importance of time and building a relationship.”\nShe called on others to spend quality time with their loved ones, “to build the good in the nation of Israel. The good that my Amit aspired to, wanted and succeeded in living.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 79 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Cpt. Shilo Rauchberger, 23, a platoon commander in the Golani Brigade, from Eli, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nShilo was stationed with his soldiers that morning at an IDF outpost close to the Gaza border, not far from Kibbutz Magen. When the rocket fire began, they ran for the on-base shelter, which was also the cafeteria, assuming that it was like any other rocket or mortar attack.\nSoon they heard gunfire and Arabic nearby and understood that Hamas gunmen had invaded. The gunmen began to throw explosives and grenades at the door of the shelter, where Shilo had taken up position. He was wounded in his arm but kept fighting, continuing to fire for hours despite bleeding extensively, until he succumbed to his wounds.\nHe was killed alongside his friend and subordinate Sgt. Amichay Rubin as well as Staff Sgt. Shlomo Reshetnikov.\nHe was buried on Jerusalem’s Mount Herzl on October 12. He is survived by his parents, Nirit and David, and his siblings Dvir, Hillel, Eliya, Hadar, Halleli and Talia.\nBorn and raised in the West Bank settlement of Eli, Shilo was always surrounded by his friends, according to an online eulogy.\nHe volunteered with a number of organizations, including the Bnei Akiva youth group, the Lev Binyamin organization for children with special needs and the One Family Fund for bereaved relatives of victims of terror.\nShilo attended high school in the settlement of Susya and then yeshiva in Eilat before enlisting in the IDF in August 2020, where he initially joined the Egoz Unit’s reconnaissance team. After completing an officer’s course, he was posted as a platoon commander in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion.\nHis brother, Eliya, told the Kan public broadcaster that the pair — separated in age by just 20 months — were very close.\n“I had so many deep conversations with him, for me he was like my partner,” said Eliya. “We shared a room, we went through the same stages in life, always seeking advice from each other.”\nHis loss is felt most strongly, he said, when he is seeking direction, “because now I have nobody to ask for advice. He was the connecting link in the family.”\nShilo’s mother, Nirit, told the Arutz Sheva news site that her son was “born on [the fast day] of Tisha B’av, and already when he was a kid I said he was a child of redemption, full of life.”\n“Shilo volunteered for years for Lev Binyamin and One Family. He lived a full life including in his depth of interactions with people, his desire to connect people, to open his heart, to give and only add goodness,” she continued.\nShe said that Shilo was home on the first day of Sukkot, a week before he was killed, and despite hosting 50 people for the holiday, “I looked for opportunities to speak with Shilo, even though he came home from the army so tired — and we sat and talked until 3 a.m., a mother-son conversation about everything.”\nThey spoke “about life, about what he wanted, about how he saw himself as a civilian — they offered him a role in the army and he was debating if to continue — about dating. It was such a meaningful conversation that tied up a lot of loose ends for me, that gave me a lot of strength. I remember every word. I thank God that we didn’t miss out on that.”\nNirit said she feels “Shilo with me every moment. His spirit is in the home, his joy, but it’s hard.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

When the sirens first started, they headed to the on-base shelter, but when they realized\nItamar called his commander to say he heard voices in Arabic inside the base, and he was scared to head to the war room, which was believed to be the safest place on the base.\nHis friend and comrade Cpl. Lior Levy went to go get him, and they and Cpl. Ofir Davidian were all slain by Hamas gunmen before they were able to reach the war room.\nUltimately the Hamas invaders also succeeded in storming the war room, and five other soldiers were killed on the base that day: Sgt. Danit Cohen, Sgt. Shir Shlomo, Sgt. Adi Groman,  Cpt. Alina Pravosudova and Sgt. Maj. Aharon Farash.\nItamar was buried on October 8 in Kiryat Gat.

He loved history, and dreamed of studying it at university after he completed his mandatory military duty.\nItamar’s friend Yair Tadjiev wrote on an Instagram memorial page about meeting at age 6: “We were best friends, we grew up together, the same school, the same hobbies. We would be at each other’s houses everyday, we’d play FIFA or soccer in the park. He was such a nice kid and everyone loved him… he honored his mom more than anything — he was a really special kid. I’ll never find another friend like him.”\nHis mother, Leah, told the Mako news site that “he left his room neat and organized — he has an Xbox he bought two months ago, a TV and a collection of Marvel action figures that he loved so much. Now they’re all orphaned.”\nLeah said that Itamar was a doting big brother to his younger brothers, who both have special needs: “He would come home as early as he could from base to help me with his younger brother, to take him wherever he was going,” she said. “It’s so hard for me think of Itamar in the past tense.

When he realized that they were under attack and he was in charge, Dekel jumped into action, survivors from the base later said.\n“He got his soldiers together, gave them a short speech about how this is what they had been readying for for months, and he fought until his last drop of blood,” Dekel’s brother, Eden, told Ynet.\nAround 10:30 a.m., when Dekel realized how outnumbered they were, he ordered most of the soldiers to hole up inside the outpost’s dining hall, which was also its bomb shelter.\nBut he and Sgt. Roei Peri remained at the main gate of the base, battling the Hamas attackers until they were both slain in the battle.\nUltimately, 14 soldiers in total were killed battling in and near the Paga outpost that day: Dekel, Roei, Staff Sgt.

Dekel loved coffee, particularly brewing it on an outdoor camping stove, and in his memory his loved ones created a line of coffee liquor.\nAt age 15, he decided to attend a pre-military dormitory school, joining the Reali School in Haifa. After graduating, he did a year of national service as a Jewish Agency emissary stationed in Atlanta, Georgia.\nNeil Kalnitz, whose family hosted Dekel while he was in Atlanta, told a local news station that “he treated people with respect and never raised his voice, and he was just a good soul.” Their son Noah said Dekel “was sweet. He was loving. He was funny. He even came on our family trips with us. We took him down to Florida.”\nWhen Dekel returned to Israel, he attended a pre-military academy in the West Bank settlement of Eli. In March 2020, he enlisted in the IDF, serving first in the elite Maglan unit, then undergoing officer’s training and was appointed as a platoon commander of trainees in the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion.\nHe was also a doting uncle to his nieces and nephews and loved spending time with them on breaks from the army, playing a big role in their lives.\nHis older sister, Lital, told Army Radio in an interview that despite the 16 years between them, “the connection between us was a special relationship, very united, we were very good friends.”\nEven though he was the youngest, she said, “he was the one who always gathered us together, he’d give us instructions and we’d happily carry them out with love. He was someone you could sit with and seek advice from, he had many insights into life.”\nDuring his year in Atlanta, she said, “he totally succeeded in his mission, he had a big influence on the community,” noting some families who had since made aliya and others who were still in contact with the Swissa family, and came specially to pay condolence calls. “He succeeded in touching so many people there.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

They worked until late at night, then took a break to sleep for a few hours before returning to the site of the rave around 6 a.m.\nWhen the rocket fire began, the group decided to stay at the festival site, assuming things would calm down quickly and the party would resume. Around 9 a.m. Shoval told a friend that there was gunfire at the festival and they were hiding underneath the stage. That was the last anyone heard from him.\nShoval, Dror, Avidan and Oded were all murdered at the rave that day.\nShoval was buried in Mehola on October 11. He is survived by his parents, Merav and Da’el, and his siblings Hamutal, Aviya, Tzuria and Roi.\nThe firstborn in his family, he was born and raised in Mehola, a small religious settlement in the Jordan Valley. He bounced between a number of religious and nonreligious schools in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu and then in Beit She’an, Kibbutz Geva and Kibbutz Ein Harod, according to a state eulogy.\nFormal education wasn’t his strong suit, his family said, and he was fiercely independent, moving at age 16 to Kibbutz Maoz Haim, working at a fishery and supporting himself. He was also active in the Bnei Akiva youth group as a kid and played basketball with a local team.\nAfter high school he enlisted in the IDF, serving first in the Kfir Brigade, later trying out for the LOTAR counterterror unit and eventually being placed in the Navy. Following his release, Shoval returned to working at the fishery in Emek HaMaayanot, first as a fisherman and later advancing to managerial roles, including operations manager. He was devoted to the topic of sustainable fishing and supporting Israeli aquaculture.\nHis family said he and his girlfriend, Noam, were planning to take time to travel around the world and then start planning their future together.\nShoval loved music and music festivals, attending trance raves for many years. His loved ones set up a memorial website, remembering him through the eclectic songs he had shared over the years on Facebook, noting that “music flowed in his veins and he spoke and lived through it… music accompanied him until his last day.”\nHis mother, Meirav, wrote online that Shoval was “hardworking, a good and loyal friend, a lover of festivals and raves.”\n“You couldn’t miss Shoval — tall, handsome, loud, a cigarette in his mouth combined with some juicy curse,” she continued. “If he loved you, he’d curse you in a Shovali way, or as he would say, ‘I can at least stand you.’ But it was just a test he put people through — if you passed the test, you were friends forever.”\nShoval was “a man of contradictions,” his mother added. “Academically challenged as a kid, but smart and always learning independently. He had a tough outside but a soft and kind heart, he was scattered and messy but responsible and took charge. He talked endlessly about aquaculture and edible fish.”\nHer eldest son, Meirav said, “was a simple guy, he didn’t need much. A bottle of beer and good friends at the end of the day and he was happy.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 85 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

He was on his way to work early that morning to replace the night guard, but he never arrived for his shift.\nHis father went out to search for him while the city was still under attack, but couldn’t find him.

He is survived by a wife, three children, his parents, Faina and Yosef, and his siblings.\nBorn in Ukraine, Leonid and his family moved to Israel in 1990, when he was 18, to avoid his conscription in the Red Army, according to his niece.\nThey settled in Sderot, and Leonid then attended an ulpan for intensive Hebrew studies in a kibbutz up north before enlisting in the army and serving in the Israeli Air Force. The move to Israel and his time in the IDF filled him with a renewed sense of self and inner strength, his family said.\nHis niece, Maayan Gal, wrote on Facebook that Leonid and his family “moved to Israel to be saved from cruelty and antisemitism that knocked on the door of their lives with an imminent threat… he was saved once at 18 and murdered at 51.”\nMaayan said that Leonid has “left a huge hole, my heart is broken. It’s hard to accept. We have a drop of comfort in that you didn’t suffer, that it was immediate. You don’t deserve this and neither does anybody. Neither do your children or your wife or Grandma and Grandpa or Mom.”\nLeonid, she wrote, “loved to ride his bike, loved nature and long hikes.

Five days later, his family was informed that his body had been identified.\nHe was buried in Karmiel on October 12. He is survived by his mother Yelena and his brother Sasha.\nAt age 6, Slava arrived at the Karmiel Youth Village, where he remained for the next 12 years, as his family was unable to raise him. While living there he attended the Adam Chevra v’Teva High School in Karmiel.\n“He grew up with another 11 children who became his brothers and sisters, and here he grew up and transformed from a kid to a successful, mature and handsome teen,” the youth village wrote in a post on Facebook.\n“After 12 years that Slava grew up in the village he went on his own way but he always stayed in touch with the youth village and visited and lived in the soldiers’ dorms,” the school added. “A handsome and smiling kid… in our dreams we saw Slava blossoming and succeeding, building a family… Slava’s memory will be in our hearts forever.”\nHis former teacher, Nir Bosco, wrote online describing him as “Slava of sunshine and thunder, Slava of the heavens… Slava of the world.”\nHe shared a poem that Slava once penned in school, where he wrote of “To rise, to arrive, to live, to move; to decide, to come closer, to join, to finish; to get to know, to start, to influence, to arrive; to survive. To return, to decide, to quit, to drink, to smoke; to go out, to do, to stop; to enter, to prefer, to be; to love. To decide, to tell, to share; to part, to join up; to develop, to succeed; to stay.”\nFriends of Slava said he was fun-loving and supportive, loved music festivals and was dedicated to physical fitness, spending hours in the gym.\nHis friend Saray Afuta wrote on Facebook that Slava “was something special, you were all love. We had so many experiences together. My friend forever! My heart is broken.”\nAnother friend, Daniela Gandi, wrote on his Facebook wall that the pair “matured in the trance scene together, and I’ll keep growing and you’ll stay by my side forever, my dear friend.”\n“Thank you for wonderful years of crazy friendship,” she added. “I appreciate everything you did… I love you to the heavens and back. Watch over our friends and your family as you know how.”\nShiraz Britch, who did national service at the Karmiel Youth Village while Slava was a student, recalled in a Facebook post how he was chosen one year to dance in the Memorial Day ceremony at school.\n“I saw the light in your beautiful eyes and I was excited along with you,” she wrote. “It wasn’t a given that you would feel safe and open enough to try new things like this – but the truth is you were always a brave kid.”\nShiraz suggested that “perhaps there began the seeds of your love for dances – dances that you danced until the day you died.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Afik Rosenthal, 20, a combat medic in the Maglan commando unit, from Kfar Menahem, was killed on October 7, 2023, battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nAfik was home on break that weekend when the Hamas attack began, and he quickly headed toward his base near Ashdod to meet up with other Maglan fighters. He and Maj. Chen Bochris, Cpt. Iftah Yavetz and two other fighters headed toward the hard-hit Kibbutz Nahal Oz near the Gaza border.\nIn a battle just outside Nahal Oz, Chen and Iftah were wounded in the fighting and Afik charged ahead to try and save them, but all three were ultimately slain. Afik was found with a tourniquet still in his hand.\nAfik was buried in Kfar Menahem on October 9. He is survived by his parents, Tom and Amir, and his siblings Yam and Shahaf.\nA close friend of his from the kibbutz, Staff Sgt. Yuval Ben Yakov, was also killed during the Hamas onslaught.\nThe youngest in his family, Afik was born in Gedera and at age 4 he moved to Kibbutz Kfar Menahem near Kiryat Malachi in the south, according to a kibbutz eulogy.\nIn December 2021 he enlisted in the IDF and joined the Paratroopers Brigade and was trained as a combat medic. Tapped as a promising fighter, in July 2023 he moved to join the Maglan elite reconnaissance unit in the Commando Brigade. For months before the Hamas attack, his family said Afik told those around him that he believed a major war was coming that would exact a heavy toll on Israel.\n“He was always surrounded by crazy amounts of friends, he loved helping others, he was funny and he united the family together,” his older sister, Shahaf, told the Ynet news site. “From a young age he wanted to give back to the country,” she said, noting his military path to Maglan.\n“He invested so much to fill in the gaps he had and to become a talented fighter,” she said. “His commander told us that he was overjoyed. Even the morning [of October 7] he had a smile on his face because he was happy that he had the privilege to go out and defend his country.”\nShahaf said the family was told that “he was a hero and through his actions saved many civilians. The only thing that gives us comfort is that he was really happy and he died while he was fulfilling all of his aspirations. We are greatly pained but also full of pride. He was in the place he wanted to be, he wanted to defend the country.”\nAfik’s father, Amir, told Army Radio that his son’s “way of life can teach us a lot on the national level and the personal level.”\n“Afik from a young age and also as a teen was surrounded by many friends, from around the country, not just from the community we lived in,” he said. “He knew always to connect to all types of people and kids and also to accept those who are different.\n“He always radiated joy, he was the glue of his friend group,” he said, noting that Afik helped Yuval integrate into the community and learn the language when he moved to the kibbutz from Russia.\n“This is just one example out of a thousand examples of how Afik would act to accept others,” Amir said. “He was always an adviser and a connector — both at home and with his friends. In every argument and every disagreement — he always believed that there wasn’t one side that was wrong and one side that was right, but that the truth was somewhere in the middle.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 88 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

Around 8 a.m. they heard voices outside and thinking it was Israelis, two of them headed out and were shot dead by Hamas terrorists, according to Human Rights Watch.\nThe terrorists then threw two grenades in the shelter, which wounded many, including Aanand. Israelis from the kibbutz arrived and told those who were injured to stay put and they would call them an ambulance, and got those who were uninjured to hide elsewhere with a group of Thai laborers.\nAmid the chaos of the attack, an ambulance was never able to arrive and Aanand died of his wounds.\nAanand’s body was flown home to Nepal on November 4, 2023, and he was laid to rest in a cremation ceremony later that day. He is survived by his parents, Soman and Shuvakala, and his three younger sisters, Sunita, Saraswati and Aarati.\nAccording to a local news site, Aanand completed high school at Angels Boarding School in Janakpurdham and pursued a B.Sc in Agriculture on a full scholarship at Far West Agricultural University.\nHe had arrived in Israel in September 2023, just a few weeks before the attack, with a group of 50 Nepalese students who were part of the 10-month training program. Ten Nepali citizens were killed in the attack and one was taken hostage.\nOn September 13, 2023, Aanand shared a post on Facebook from the Israeli Embassy about the group’s departure, writing: “Thank you Israel.”\nAn online news site described Aanand as a nature lover who dreamed of one day planting 10 million trees and giving back to his community.\nAccording to a Nepali news site, Aanand was the oldest of his four siblings, the only son and “his family’s only support.”\n“Where did you go? Why don’t you come back? Who is going to look after us?” his parents said, according to the site.\nThe family’s neighbor Mithilesh Sah, told the site that “his father and mother had high hopes for him,” with his father working for a decade in the Persian Gulf so that Aanand could go to school.\n“His parents had sacrificed a lot to educate him,” Mithilesh said. “One can only imagine what they must be going through after their son’s tragic death.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Stanislav “Stas” Sheinkman, 40, a member of the Israel Police’s Yamam counter-terrorism unit, from Be’er Yaakov, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nAt 5:30 a.m. that morning, Stas was called up to the front line, part of a small group of officers in the elite Yamam counter-terror unit who were alerted by the Shin Bet ahead of the attack and sent out to investigate.\nStas, who was the unit’s point person to coordinate with the military, met with a group of officers and handed them weapons before then heading toward the Re’im base, the headquarters of the IDF’s Gaza Division.\nHe made it only to the gate of Kibbutz Re’im, at 7:50 a.m., footage shows. There he engaged in a gun battle with two pickup trucks of Hamas gunmen and was slain in the fighting.\nStas was buried in Rishon Lezion on October 11. He is survived by his wife, Alona, their three children, Bar, 8, Leo, 5, and Mila, 2, his father Igor and his siblings.\nBorn in Russia, Stas moved to Israel with his family in 1997 when he was a teenager.\nHe joined Yamam in 2006, had a degree in criminology from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and had also pursued Judaic studies at the Ono Academic College.\nStas served for 17 years in Yamam, in a number of different roles: “During his service he took part in many operational activities, some very complicated and dangerous,” wrote the unit in a eulogy. “They led to the thwarting of terror attacks, neutralizing and arresting terrorists and saving the lives of many Israelis.”\n“Stas was a moral, professional and dedicated fighter and commander, a man of unflinching truth with a sense of mission and belief in the justness of the cause,” the eulogy continued. “A professional with respect and reverence for the profession of warriors. A pedant down to the tiniest details, a true friend, a brother in arms and an incredible family man.”\nThe One Million Lobby, an organization of Russian-speaking Israelis, noted that Stas “went through a challenging aliyah process which led to difficulties with the language and his studies, until during his army service he found his place and his calling as a fighter.”\nDuring his time in the Border Police he “uncovered the talent that lay within him – to be the first to every incident, always charging ahead and being there for others even if it came at great personal risk.”\nThe organization said Stas “was a sensitive and generous man who was all heart, with a warm and unforgettable voice, who was a support and shoulder for his family and many friends, and made sure to be present and supportive at all stages of their lives, despite the nature of his work.”\nStas’s sister-in-law, Marina Karalov, wrote online to “Stas, our iron man, the man who could do anything, a true mensch, the perfect husband to my sister and a perfect father to my nieces and nephews. You were their whole world, they worshipped the ground you walked on and on the flip side they were your whole world.”\nMarina added that there “are not enough words to describe this connection, you were a true team and you built an incredible family together… those who knew you were privileged, and those you didn’t lost out.”\nHis wife, Alona, wrote on Facebook marking a year since he was killed: “A year without you, my heart.

    "story": "Sgt. Or Menashe Avital, 20, a soldier in the 7th Armored Brigade, from Kibbutz Merom Golan, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the Nahal Oz IDF outpost.\nWith the start of the attack, Or and his team were sent in their tank toward the border fence, where they battled for two hours against Hamas invaders, managing to kill a number of them.\nWhen they heard of the fighting going on inside Nahal Oz, they returned to the base and there continued to fight Hamas gunmen, until their tank was hit by an anti-tank missile. Another missile hit the area where Or was sitting, and he was killed, alongside the tank commander Staff Sgt. Yoni Golan.\nHis family was only notified four days later that he had been killed.\nOr was buried in Merom Golan on October 12. He is survived by his parents, Eti and Arik, and his older sisters Almog and Ofek.\nBorn in Moshav Haniel near Netanya, Or’s family moved before his second birthday to Kibbutz Merom Golan in the Golan Heights, where he grew up, according to an IDF eulogy.\nThe youngest in his family, Or stood out for his sharp intellect even as a kid, his loved ones said, teaching himself computers, math and English and proving able to memorize huge amounts of information.\nHe was a class clown who loved to entertain his friends, and his favorite holiday was Purim, when he always invested in his costume, his family said. He was deeply connected to Israel, loving to explore nature and enjoying classic Israeli music.\nOr fought to enlist in a combat unit, including gathering doctor’s recommendations, working out and eating right, and was thrilled to ultimately join the Armored Brigade on August 9, 2022, where he trained as a tank gunner.\nHis family said instead of embarking on a post-army trip around the world, Or was planning to hike the Israel Trail after his release, to explore his own homeland before visiting other countries.\nHis older sister, Ofek, wrote on an Instagram memorial page about how “every song on the radio reminds me of you.”\n“The knowledge that you’ll remain 20 forever is incomprehensible, how can it be?” she wrote. “You had so many dreams to achieve, so many experiences still to go through… Thank you for 20 years of being with us, for the many laughs, the nonsense, the experiences, and also the fights.”\nOfek wrote, “More than my brother, you were my best friend. Thanks for us always being together, to the level of knowing everything about each other. For looking and acting like we’re twins, except you stole my height. Thanks for caring, supporting, protecting and helping me with everything even though I was actually your big sister.”\nOr’s other sister, Almog, wrote online about the longing, the fact that “you don’t call, you don’t send a message that ‘everything is OK,’ you don’t come home for the weekend.”\n“We don’t fall asleep in our disgusting uniforms on the couch anymore, you don’t smoke next to the window and make Mom mad that the smell is everywhere,” she continued. “You don’t eat everything in the kitchen at night when everyone is asleep and you don’t annoy us to ‘go for a walk, go do something.’”\nAlmog said it “hurts so much that these normal things will never be repeated, and now are just memories. You went to sleep permanently, in Merom Golan that you loved so much, sleeping in the most beautiful view there is.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 91 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Moshe “Moshiko” Saadyan, 26, from Yavne, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while trying to flee the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHe attended the rave with a group of four friends – two of whom were also slain that day: Guy Azar and Ben Hasid.\nThe two surviving friends, Raz Mordechai and Or Moshe, told the Daily Mail that they initially got in their car to leave before encountering a police roadblock, and just ahead of it, a pickup truck of Hamas terrorists who opened fire.\n“Terrified that we would be caught in the crossfire – we scrambled out of the car before running away across the nearby scrubland,” the two survivors said. “The two of us managed to stay together but – before we knew it – Guy, Moshe and Ben were nowhere to be seen.”\nAt 8:30 a.m., Moshe told his girlfriend Ma’ayan that he was tying a tourniquet on somebody who was wounded. That was the last anybody heard from him.\nAfter a week of searching, his family was informed that his body had been identified.\nHe was buried in Yavne on October 14. He is survived by his parents, Motti and Vered, and his younger siblings Tehilla, Yair, Hadas, Agam, Tohar and Yahel.\nBorn and raised in Yavne, Moshe was the oldest in the family, ahead of his younger sister and his five half-siblings. He attended local schools, and after graduating he enlisted in the IDF and served in the Givati Brigade.\nHe was an entrepreneur who was always dreaming up his next business venture, his family said, working most recently in car sales.\nA year before he was killed, Moshe and his sister took part in a weeklong personal development workshop in Turkey, during which he wrote his vision for the future – dated October 14, 2022, exactly one year before his funeral was held.\n“With the strength and determination that I possess in quiet and inner peace, I build a world founded on the values of abundance, prosperity, unconditional love and freedom,” he wrote at the time. “I provide a personal example and inspiration to all those children who dream that everything is possible and if they want it – it’s not a fairy tale… I am a success story, I am proud of myself and the path I took despite everything.”\n“Moshiko was my firstborn, all of our eyes were on him, we adored him,” his mother, Vered, told Ynet. “He always brought with him a sense of joy, he lit up every place he entered. He was characterized by endless generosity and a captivating smile.”\nVered said Moshe “was always there for others, helped anyone who needed. He brought a sense of security everywhere he went, made sure to always convey to those around him that there are good people doing good things. He loved to travel and to laugh… he was something special.”\nShe said he went through difficulties in life, including his parents’ divorce and financial troubles: “Moshiko went through many upheavals in life, in different areas. He always worked on himself, tried to improve, to be better, to find strength in crises. He had a girlfriend, he was planning to move up north this year and I planned to move with him. I felt like recently he had found his place.”\nHis sister, Tehilla, told the Mako news site, “He wasn’t just a brother, he was my best friend, my conversationalist. If I were annoyed he knew how to reach me. I was fire and he was water, and he, who knew only how to judge people positively, always looked at the good side of people.”\nTehilla said her older brother “was really a beautiful kid – inside and out. A leader at home and with his friends. Everyone loved him, everyone gathered around him. He was the psychologist for everyone.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

At 6:30 a.m. she told her family that they were leaving the site of the festival.\nBut a couple hours later, she said they were stuck in a traffic jam and hadn’t progressed far from the site of the festival. The family later said that they learned from others that May had hidden in a fridge at the site of a bar set up at the festival.\nFor a week, May’s family searched desperately for any news, until they were informed that her body had been identified. Jenny and Ilan were also slain in the attack.\nMay was buried on October 15 in Hod Hasharon. She is survived by her mother, Sharon, and her older sister, Eden. Her father, Yehezkel, died in 2017.\nRaised and educated in Hod Hasharon, her loved ones described her as smart, kind and beautiful, always surrounded by friends.\nShe loved to travel the world and had dreams of crisscrossing the globe and exploring different cultures. Her mother said May once told her: “The world is full of beauty! Israel is nice, but it’s so small and I wasn’t born for small — I was born for big, and out there everything is big. There you see everything — cultures, people of all colors, cities, religions. Out in the world you feel small and special and that’s what I want to feel.”\nAt age 20 she started working as a waitress at the Beer Garden in Tel Aviv and later became its events manager. In a post online Beer Garden described her as “smiling, kind, beloved and always helping and giving.”\nAt the same time, May was teaching herself computer science and had big dreams for her future career.\n“My gorgeous, you loved life so much, you enjoyed even when things were tough, you loved to laugh and to make people laugh and to lighten the mood always,” her friend Tom Atsmon wrote on Facebook. “Keep dancing up in heaven, there nobody will stop the music anymore.”\nOn Memorial Day 2024, May’s sister, Eden, wrote on Facebook that “this year, bereavement came to our door, my sister, the dearest thing to me, the light of my life, was murdered.”\n“Not a day goes by that my heart is not torn apart by longing, sharp and stabbing pain,” continued Eden. “I love you and you live every second and every hundredth of a second in my heart next to me.”\n“I’ll remember you forever with a huge smile, a wide heart and endless joy for life.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Chaim Peri, 79, was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7. He was murdered in captivity in February 2024, and his body was recovered by IDF troops in August 2024 and returned to Israel for burial.\nChaim was taken captive from his home during the Hamas attack while his wife, Osnat, managed to survive hiding in their reinforced room for hours until she was rescued. His son Lior and daughter Inbal’s half-brother, Danny Darlington, was also slain in the kibbutz that day alongside his friend Carolin Bohl.\nIn December 2023, Hamas published a propaganda video featuring Chaim and fellow captives Amiram Cooper and Yoram Metzger. In June 2024, the IDF confirmed that Chaim, Amiram, Yoram and Nadav Popplewell had all been killed.\nOn August 20, 2024, the IDF announced that it had recovered the bodies of Chaim, Yoram, Nadav, Avraham Munder, Yagev Buchshtav and Alex Dancyg from Khan Younis, and returned them to Israel for burial. In an investigation published in December 2024, the IDF said it believes Chaim and the five others were shot dead by their captors amid nearby Israeli airstrikes in mid-February.\nChaim was buried in Kibbutz Nir Oz on August 27, 2024. He is survived by his wife, Osnat, their five children, Inbal, Lior, Noam, Ofri and Reut, and 13 grandchildren — Mai, Daphne, Itai, Lia, Noy, Gili, Naomi, Ella, Daria, Neta, Ofir, Ayana and Arbel.\nBorn in Givatayim, Chaim joined a Labor Zionist youth group that brought him at age 18 to Nir Oz, where he remained for the rest of his life. He served during his army service in the Paratroopers Brigade and went on to fight in four major Israeli wars, including the Six Day War and the Yom Kippur War.\nIn the kibbutz he worked in the mechanic shop, learning to work with iron and metals and later using them to create sculptures. In 1999 he turned an abandoned building inside the kibbutz into an art gallery known as the “White House.” He was also a film teacher who wrote his own screenplays, and in later years wrote two children’s books — one of which was published after his death.\nHe and his wife, Osnat, together raised his oldest two children from his first marriage, her daughter from her first marriage and their two shared children together in the kibbutz in harmony. Chaim was also a peace activist who volunteered for the Road to Recovery organization which drove Gazan children from the border to Israeli hospitals for treatment. He loved Hapoel Tel Aviv, classic Israeli music and sipping on a glass of wine.\nWriting in Israel Hayom, his wife, Osnat, said that “words cannot describe the depth of my sadness or the hole that is left in our family’s heart.”\n“Chaim was a pillar of strength, dad to our five children and grandfather to our 13 dear grandchildren. He was an entrepreneur, a peace activist, a man of vision and compassion, dedicated to building bridges and to fostering understanding.\n“He was a man who dedicated his life to peace, but his life was cut short in violence and hatred,” she continued, noting that he was taken while protecting her, ultimately saving her life. “His spirit lives in the hearts of those who loved him, the lives he touched and the ideals he championed.”\nThe kibbutz shared a eulogy written together by his 13 grandchildren, who described him as “a legend in the family — a brand name. A unique, once-in-a-generation man.”\n“Grandpa was the most optimistic, happiest, kindest person. He was one of the smartest people we knew. Intelligent and sharp. He always knew what to say and what to advise,” they wrote. “A man of who believed in equality, peace, mutual respect and acceptance. A man who led by example and uncompromising action. Grandpa was humble, loved the little things, spoke seriously but always knew how to make us laugh.”\n“Thank you for the uncompromising path you paved for us and from which we will continue, each on his own path.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 94 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Sgt. Matan Yisrael Malka, 19, a soldier in the Paratroopers Brigade, from Kibbutz Gesher Haziv, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas attack on Kibbutz Kissufim.\nAt the time of the Hamas attack, Matan was taking part in a squad commander’s training course, and was stationed on base. With the start of the invasion, Matan and his comrades were sent southward toward Kibbutz Kissufim to join the fighting, according to an IDF eulogy.\nAt 9:30 a.m. he spoke to his parents and told them he was being sent to help rescue residents of the Gaza border area. Along they way they encountered a number of others in need of help, as well as engaged in gun battles with other Hamas gunmen.\nThey arrived at Kissufim in the afternoon, and there Matan was shot dead while trying to rescue besieged residents, alongside five comrades: Staff Sgt. Adam Agmon, Staff Sgt. Omri Peretz, Sgt. Bar Yankilov, Sgt. Lavi Buchnik and Sgt. Regev Amar.\nMatan was buried on October 12 in Gesher Haziv. He is survived by his parents, Libat and Yossi, and his younger siblings, Ohad, Amit and Itamar.\nThe firstborn in the family, Matan was born in Kiryat Haim and raised in Gesher Haziv in the Western Galilee. He attended local schools and played tennis, in which he excelled.\nDespite standing out in the sport, at age 16, Matan quit tennis to focus on getting in shape to fulfill his dream of joining the Paratroopers and also worked at a boating club in Nahariya. In December 2022, he enlisted into the Paratroopers Brigade and later joined a squad commander’s course.\nHis loved ones said he was always looking out for those around him, including two immigrant lone soldiers in his battalion. In his memory, his family established a lodging house for lone soldiers in his name in Jerusalem.\nAt the ceremony, his mother, Libat, said that “his whole life, Matan always saw those who were different from him. During basic training, he adopted two friends from overseas, from France and the US, and during the shiva, they told us that Matan was always making sure they understood the language and he would explain things to them again so they would understand and fit in.”\n“Matan saw everything modestly,” she said. “Love thy neighbor as thyself — even if he’s not like you, that was exactly him.” Libat said that “in his values, giving to others was the most basic thing, thanking them for coming to protect the country they didn’t live in.”\nIn his notebook that they found after his death, she said, he expressed a great desire to fight for his country: “There are those who would call us suckers, but I call it Zionism and generosity and true love,” he wrote.\nHis girlfriend since 10th grade, Shahar, wrote online about “everything we went through together, everything we planned to do together.”\n“You had huge dreams… three years of incredible friendship, you were always there and then suddenly you were gone,” she added. “And I? I am left with a huge longing and an enormous hole because they took my heart and shattered it into pieces. You lit up everywhere you went, you made everyone you met laugh, there’s nowhere and nobody you didn’t leave your mark on.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

When the rocket fire began, Avi decided to turn around and head home, but unknowingly passed by a cell of Hamas terrorists on the street who were opening fire on every passerby.\nAvi was shot dead on the street while on his motorcycle. His family saw his body on the news and went out to find him, and one relative decided to remain by his side until he was collected — playing dead so he would not be targeted.\nDespite identifying his body at the scene, his family waited more than 10 days to be able to bury him amid the upheaval and influx of bodies.\nHe was buried in Sderot on October 18. He is survived by his wife, Michal, their four children, Shalev, Shaked, Ilay and Ori, his parents, Mazal and Eliyahu and his siblings Maya and Mishel.\nHis niece, Or Maman Hadad, told a local radio station that her uncle “was an incredible person, wonderful, he was like a dad to me. I remember as a kid I was so connected to him, I would go with him everywhere. He’s a good person… A good dad, a person who — as his niece I could call him at 2 a.m. and say, ‘Avi I’m stuck can you come get me,’ and he would just get up and get in the car and come get me. He was an incredible dad to his kids.”\nOn Memorial Day 2024, Avi’s sister, Maya, wrote on Facebook that “we would talk every day about everything, you were a listening ear for me and I for you. You knew how to listen, to accept and also to get mad and tell me I was wrong if needed.”\nMaya said Avi was a dedicated father and doting uncle to her children, “admired by all of us, handsome, a role model, you’ll stay young forever and we’ll always remember the glow of your beautiful face.”\nWriting on Facebook, Avi’s son, Shaked, said he was used to being awoken by his father every Saturday “from the engine of your motorcycle as you headed out to tear up the streets as only you knew how.”\nThe last time he saw him, he said, was after Yom Kippur, when he dropped him off at the train station to return to his IDF base.\n“You were so proud of me, of my path and how much you saw yourself in me,” wrote Shaked. “We were so close, like partners, you were a father, you were my best friend, my partner in everything, you would share everything with me and you would direct me along every path.”\nShaked said, “I wouldn’t do anything without knowing your opinion, you were my teacher, my guide, my role model… You loved life so much, you were young at heart, a dad who was a kid, you loved to enjoy, to be happy in every moment, you were loved by everyone.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

When the rocket fire began, the two tried to leave the site of the festival, and were shot at by Hamas gunmen along the road. Both Elazar and Meir were wounded, but kept driving, according to a municipal eulogy.\nThe brothers made it to the Sha’ar Hanegev Junction near Sderot, where a jeep full of Hamas terrorists shot at them, and Meir lost control of the car and crashed. He tried desperately to save Elazar, but realized it was too late. Meir, wounded, fled with another partygoer and was ultimately rescued and survived.\nElazar’s body was not recovered and identified for more than two weeks.\nHe was buried on October 23 in Ashdod. He is survived by his parents, Rachel and Jacky, and his eight siblings.\nElazar was the 7th child in his large ultra-Orthodox family, and grew up in Ashdod, attending local religious schools. Though he later left behind the Haredi way of life, he remained deeply connected to his faith and his family – he even had a tattoo reading “family” underneath an image of an anchor on his ribcage.\nHis family said he enjoyed spending time at the beach, surfing, playing matkot (Israeli paddle ball) and also enjoyed time out in nature.\nElazar’s brother, Shimon, wrote on social media on Memorial Day: “My beloved little brother. The longing is endless, I hope things are good for you up there and you are watching over us.”\nHis mother, Rachel, said Elazar “was particularly characterized by his joy. There was always a smile on his face. He loved to laugh and to be happy. Even when he got angry, he’d immediately calm down and laugh.”\nA friend of his wrote online that he recalled “how you would dance on the dancefloor with a huge smile on your face and eyes sparkling with joy. You would spread good energy and love everywhere and make everything feel perfect.

For a week his loved ones searched for any sign of him until they were informed that his body had been identified.\nHe was buried in Petah Tikva on October 15. He is survived by his parents, Lizette and Israel, and his older siblings Gili and Nadia.\nThe youngest in the family, Hezi attended local schools, including high school in nearby Bnei Brak, according to a state eulogy.\nAfter graduating, he enlisted in the IDF, serving first in the army police before moving to work in the kitchen at a prison for soldiers near Haifa. When he was released, Hezi traveled around South America for several months.\nUpon his return to Israel, he started working for the Israel Post and in recent years worked as a mailman in Petah Tikva, a job he greatly enjoyed.\nHezi also volunteered at a free supermarket for needy families and the elderly, his family said. His two great loves were music and soccer – he was a superfan of the Maccabi Tel Aviv team and he loved attending trance music festivals around Israel.\nHis friend Liraz David described Hezi in a Facebook post as “generous, funny, smiley and loved life – and you lived it as a king.”\n“Everyone remembers you smiling, even if you annoyed 1,000 people – half an hour later you would come and hug whoever you argued with,” she continued. “Nobody could be mad at you.”\n“You were a star that lit up the area for everyone,” Liraz continued. “The weekend arrives and there’s nobody for me to bug and look around for a good party with… I’ll continue at every festival to dance in your memory, in the place where you blossomed.”\nMarking a month since he was killed, his sister, Nadia, wrote on Facebook that “just a moment ago I saw you last and now you are in the ground.”\n“I can’t believe I won’t see you again, with no warm hug and loving words,” she continued. “I still can’t believe that it’s over and you won’t come back. I imagine it’s all a bad dream, that soon I’ll wake up and see you here with us.”\n“My Hez-hez, you died a hero when you protected your friends and now you belong to God,” added Nadia. “I’m sure he will enjoy you the way we all enjoyed you… I loved you, I love you, and will always love you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 100 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

When he heard the gunfire, Ilay headed to the main gate of the base to join the battle against the Hamas invaders, according to an IDF eulogy.\nHe refused to leave the position even when his commander told him to, and continued to battle against the Hamas gunmen until he was shot and killed in the fighting.\nIlay was slain defending the gate to the IDF outpost alongside a number of other soldiers, including Staff Sgt.

You had a different way of looking at things, you always found the good, always smiling, you were pure, you only had good intentions.”\nIlay would “make everyone laugh, was full of hope and took things lightly… I think everyone can learn from you, about your perspective, your courage, your endless joy.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Amichai Yaacov Vanino, 22, a squad commander in the Maglan commando unit, from Katzrin, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Kfar Aza.\nThat morning, Amichai was stationed at the Julis IDF base, east of Ashkelon. When the attack began, he and the rest of his team in the elite reconnaissance unit were sent toward the front lines.\nThey arrived at the hard-hit Kibbutz Kfar Aza, where they went house by house rescuing residents and eliminating Hamas gunmen, according to an IDF eulogy. In one home, Amichai’s commander, Cpt. Eily Adany, was shot and seriously wounded, and Amichai pulled him out and got him to an evacuation vehicle while trying to staunch his wounds.\nWhile Eilay and Amichai were evacuating from the kibbutz, Hamas gunmen opened fire on their vehicle with a volley of bullets, and neither of them survived.\nAmichai was buried on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem on October 11. He is survived by his parents, Rachel and Menachem, and his seven siblings, Herut, Aluma, Itai, Benaya, Avishai, Elad and Roni.\nBorn in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba in the south Hebron Hills, Amichai attended a religious high school in Dimona, according to a memorial website. When he was 14, his family decided to settle in Katzrin in the Golan Heights, although he finished out high school in the south, traveling home only on weekends.\nAfter high school, Amichai enrolled in the Elon Moreh yeshiva in the northern West Bank, where he spent three years immersed in Torah study, including a brief period at a yeshiva in Bruchin.\nIn August 2022 he enlisted in the IDF, joining the elite Maglan unit. His loved ones described him as multi-faceted, both a Torah scholar, a warrior, a poet and a deep thinker, who left behind a great deal of writing and reflections on life.\nIn one of his notebooks, which his family found after his death, Amichai described the exertion in his army training: “This isn’t sweat, it’s the tears of 2,000 years.”\nHis mother, Racheli, wrote in a eulogy that she “was privileged to be your mother for 22 years. You were my best friend, we understood each other without words.”\n“If I was ever feeling low, you would do everything for me to be happy again,” she continued. “We went hand-in-hand together through your life journey. You always charged ahead, you directed yourself with your incredible inner voice, how to advance, how to be a more whole person.”\nRacheli said Amichai was so looking forward to the end of his lengthy training period and to continue advancing in the military: “You had so many more dreams. And you rejoiced so much with every step and progression in the unit.”\nAmichai’s older sister, Herut, wrote a eulogy to her little brother, “the most introspective and profound man there is, you carved out your personality, your thoughts, you had so much depth in your soul.”\n“Every step in your life stemmed from a thorough and broad reflection, you mapped out your inner world and knew how to walk through it step by step to advance with courage and internal reflection.”\n“Our funny Amich, there was nothing like your impressions, your hilarious comments in the right places, your WhatsApp stickers that made us explode with laughter,” Herut added. “To me, you were always a high, supreme, noble soul, with one leg in this world and another in a world that was all a secret, a hidden world, deeper.”\n“I love you so much!

    "story": "Ron Yehudai, 24, from Yehud, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHe attended the rave with a large group of friends, and when the attack began, he hid in a large trash dumpster at the site of the festival. There he and a group of others covered themselves with garbage bags hoping to go undetected.\nOne of his friends had been with him in the dumpster, but at 10:15 a.m. decided to dash out and hide under a nearby trailer. Ron kept his family updated, texting them for the last time at 11:39 a.m., writing “It’ll be okay, love you.”\nAt 11:47 a.m., Hamas gunmen discovered those hiding inside the dumpster and opened fire. Ron and eight others were murdered there: Ilkin Nazarov, Inbar Shem Tov, Yitfah Tweg, Hadar Prince, Amit Levy, David Newman, Maya Bitton and Eliran Mizrahi.\nA week later, Ron’s family was informed that his body had been identified. He was buried in Yehud on October 16. He is survived by his parents, Yoram and Sigal, and his siblings Adi and Noam.\nRon, a huge soccer fan, played until he was 18 — when he put down his cleats to enlist in the army, where he served as a driver in a combat unit. He was released during the COVID era, and put off his post-army trip until world travel resumed.\nHe was a devotee of the Beitar Jerusalem team, attending their games around the country and the world, and even cutting short his big trip around South America to attend their game in Thessaloniki in August 2023.\nRon also loved tattoos, and was constantly adding to his collection, and dreamed of one day becoming a tattoo artist himself. He also had plans to become a trance music DJ and possibly pursue a career as a soccer coach.\nHis sister, Noam, told Maariv that “it’s hard to sum up Ron in a few words because he was a world of magic in himself. From the moment he was born, he understood that this life is lived every day, and you don’t have to wait for a specific moment to do something or have some kind of experience.”\nRon “wasn’t a guy who overthought things or vacillated, he just did what he wanted, when it came to both little and big decisions in his life,” she said.\nNoam said the siblings never fought, “not even once… he had no room for arguments, and that’s how it was also with his friends. It was also his motto for life. He made sure to tattoo his life on his body… and he made sure to only do good to everyone around him.”\nShe said Ron had a special connection to colors, “he was magical and he loved colors and spreading good things with his smile, so everywhere he went he would buy some kind of bracelet with the colors he liked, often yellow and black due to the fact that he was a fan of Beitar Jerusalem – he had a dreamcatcher necklace and bracelets of all kinds that he would swap out depending on the event.”\nHis mother, Sigal, wrote on Facebook in July 2024 commemorating the moment a year earlier when he had returned from months abroad.\n“You ran to me and said, ‘Mom, I’m back, I’m home.’ The excitement was at its peak. I made you the things you requested – stuffed vegetables and chocolate balls… you said ‘Mom, I missed your food.’”\nSigal said she “refuses to believe that it’s over, that it’s real. It doesn’t make sense not to hear your unique rolling laugh. It doesn’t make sense that you won’t walk in the house and ask, ‘Mommy, what is there to snack on?’”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

He was helping to treat injured comrades inside an on-base bomb shelter when he was himself wounded.\nAfter patching himself up, Lior went back out to fight and was killed in battle after nine hours of fighting to defend the base. Overall 14 IDF soldiers were killed in Paga that day.\nA week before the Hamas attack, Lior’s commanders had decided to allow him to attend a sniper’s course, which he wanted to do, and then have him train as a commander.\nHe was buried in Ashkelon on October 11. He is survived by his mother, Natalia, stepfather, Sergei, older sister Camilla and younger brother Lionel.\nHis mother, Natalia, told the Kan public broadcaster that Lior’s father, Timor, died in 2010 from complications after being injured in the Tel Aviv Stage Club terror attack in 2005, and that Lior had become the man of the house.\n“He would come to me in the morning and bring me a cup of coffee and tell me to get up and not be late for work. And when I cried at night, he was next to me and told me not to cry and said that everything was from God,” she said.\nLior’s grandmother was killed in 1992 fighting in the Nagorno-Karabakh War. His parents moved to Israel in 2000 and settled in Ashkelon, where he was born.\nHis grandmother, Valentina, said Lior “was simply a hero, a beloved hero.”\nAt a memorial ceremony 30 days after he was killed, Natalia said that Lior “contributed a lot of [himself] for the community, friends, family and our people.”\n“You paid the dearest price in our world — you paid with your life. You managed to do so much in your life, and there was so much you didn’t manage to do,” she said.\nLior was a talented artist and, shortly before the war, he drew a picture of an army of faceless soldiers carrying iron swords with a tree in the background.\nWhen President Isaac Herzog heard about the drawing, he decided to feature it on the president’s website. The caption accompanying the drawing described Lior as “a sensitive young man, and a talented artist who loved the sea.”\nIt said he loved to fish and dreamed of sailing a yacht.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

When the attack began, he was on a routine patrol near the border, and with word of the invasion, they headed to counter the Hamas gunmen.\nTomer and his comrades battled Hamas at a monument near Kibbutz Sufa where they were called to assist other soldiers holed up there inside a roadside bomb shelter. As they approached, their jeep was hit by an RPG, and Tomer was severely wounded but still managed to get out of the jeep and keep fighting.\nUltimately, he was slain in the battle alongside Cpt.

He attended religious schools, and for high school traveled to Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu.\nHis loved ones said Tomer loved to sing and play guitar and was always composing his own songs. As a teen, he started a band that performed covers of Israeli songs. A song he wrote and recorded at 16 — called “Kochav Zohar” (Shining Star) was produced and released in his memory.\nHe also danced in a local troupe and enjoyed playing chess and basketball.\nAfter high school, Tomer spent a year in the Aderet pre-military academy in Ayanot, then enlisted in the IDF in August 2021, following in his older brother’s footsteps and joining the Nahal Brigade’s reconnaissance unit.\nHis brother, Matan, told a radio station that “Tomer was a happy and beloved kid, he wanted the most combat role possible in the army and they gave him a role overseeing the company. He was the most loved in his company.”\nMatan said his younger brother was “a mischievous kid, he loved to sit with his friends for hours, loved to play the guitar and sing, he loved the good life.”\nHis mother, Sarit, wrote in the Makor Rishon newspaper about years of visiting Tomer on army bases, “with the fish dish that you loved and challah to wipe up the sauce and salads and a bottle of Nestea. But we never went to Sufa… because what could ever happen at Sufa?”\nSarit wrote of all the things she wishes she could tell Tomer: “I would tell you that our calendar is packed full, the house is packed full, and our heart is empty.”\n“I would tell you that we called the WhatsApp group where we share things about you ‘the salt of the earth.’ Do you remember that once you told someone that you and your friends were the ‘salt of the earth,’ and we all laughed and made fun of you? It took many years and one funeral to understand that you were right.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 106 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

He is survived by his parents, Galina and Eduard, and his older sister, Orly.\nHis friends and family described him as a smart and curious person who stood out because of his intellectuality and creativity. They also said he loved sports, music, dancing, food, nature, the beach, his friends and books, according to a state eulogy. He also loved chess, and his loved ones hosted a chess tournament in his memory.\nAfter finishing high school, Lior enlisted in the IDF and served in combat support in the Israeli Air Force. Following his release, he traveled abroad before returning and starting a bachelor’s degree in software and information systems engineering at Ben Gurion University, before continuing on to a master’s degree in the same subject.\nDar, Lior’s girlfriend, said he was the most special person she had ever met, and that she knew the day they met that she had met her soulmate.\n“From the first moment, I realized that he was the smartest, most good-looking, and most intelligent person who could also make me laugh until my stomach hurt. Lior was the most ambitious person I’d ever met, who inspired me and so many other people. I would always look at him and be inspired by how he excelled at everything he touched,” she said.\nShe added that Lior supported her, made her laugh, and was her shoulder to cry on when she needed it.\n“Lior taught me how not to give up when things were hard, how to look at the cup as half full, and how not to be disappointed by what you didn’t have. He was my whole world, my support, and he always pushed me to succeed and believed in me like I’d never believed in myself,” she said.\nLior’s friend from university, Denis, wrote that they had been partners in most of their academic projects and that Lior had helped him succeed.\n“More than that, you were my partner in life. Thank you for knowing how to make us laugh during the hardest times. Thank you for infecting me with your passion and love for life, your courage to take advantage of every opportunity and live life every day like it was your last,” he wrote.\nAnother friend, Eden, wrote on Facebook that Lior was “a wonderful and hilarious person and a real friend who knew how to turn anything complicated into something simple.”\n“He touched so many people in his life, especially during his degree. Every conversation with him pulled you in, every party with him was incredible, and every project with him was 100% guaranteed,” she wrote.\nRon, another friend of Lior’s, wrote that “not a day goes by that I don’t think of you smiling from ear to ear because that was your way and that’s how I want to remember you — happy.”\n“You taught people how to smile, laugh, share, and experience, and there were a million other traits to you,” he wrote.\nAfter being rescued in July, Argamani posted on social media, memorializing Lior and Yevgeni.\n“How can I go back to a reality that I know you won’t be part of? You were a massive part of my life, each of you in his own way. How did that party we went to together become a terrible tragedy?” she wrote.\nShe added that she would always remember them as the happy people they were “with a huge smile and a big heart.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

At the start of the rocket fire, he told his family that the festival was being canceled and he was on his way home.\nWhile trying to leave, however, they came across those who had been wounded and tried to help. At 8:43 a.m. he told his friends that “you won’t believe what’s happening here, they blew up the party, hit cars with RPGs, there are tons of wounded people.” But seven minutes later, he told his family: “Everything’s fine, it’ll be over soon and we’ll leave here.”\nHis family never heard from him again. For a week he was considered missing until his family was notified that his body had been found. Liav and Dvir were also murdered that day, while two other friends managed to escape and survive.\nSahar was buried in Netanya on October 14, 10 days before his 23rd birthday. He is survived by his parents, Sima and Babar, and his older sister, Eden.\nBorn and raised in Afula, Sahar was known best for his bashful smile, according to a memorial website. At age 13 he insisted on having his bar mitzvah at the Western Wall, his family said, setting out on a bus from Afula at 5 a.m. for the festivities.\nAfter finishing high school, Sahar enlisted in the IDF and served in the Combat Engineering Corps. Following his release, he started studying UI/UX and was interested in the field of graphic arts, but at the same time started working in Kibbutz Yir’on in the Galilee through the Hashomer Hachadash’s agricultural program.\nThe organization said that “despite the physically challenging work, Sahar found beauty in every moment – photographed sunrises in the orchards, enjoying the nature he loved and spreading joy around him.”\nHis family said Sahar loved to live in the moment, enjoyed cooking, loved animals, exploring nature and hiking trails, and was always surrounded by music.\nHis older sister, Eden, wrote on Facebook in November 2023, marking five weeks “without calling you ‘kid’ and hearing you call me ‘monkey.’ Without your embrace, without seeing you.”\nShe recalled seeing him just hours before he left for the festival, and “your loving and enveloping hug that I will never find a replacement for, and never get to feel again.”\n“You are missing at family meals, you’re missing in the conversations we’d have at night, you’re missing at home,” Eden wrote. “Your room still smells like you, your shoes are sitting in their place, your bag is organized for another week on the kibbutz… but you, you’ll never return to this room again.”\nSahar’s mother, Sima, wrote on social media marking 10 months “since evil took our light.”\n“My child, my Sahar, you believed in good, you lived with goodness,” she wrote. “We’ll never get to feel your hug again.

    "story": "Sgt. Amit Tsur, 19, a soldier in the Golani Brigade, from Elyachin, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nHe was stationed that morning at the small Erez outpost next to the northern Gaza border. Amit and his commander, Cpt. Itay Maor, his comrade and close friend Sgt. Uri Locker and another soldier, David, were out on a routine patrol near the border that morning in a jeep when the attack began.\nThe four of them battled Hamas invaders near Netiv Ha’asara, managing to kill some of the gunmen, until Amit, Itay and Uri were slain in battle — and only David survived.\nAmit was buried in Elyachin on October 10. He is survived by his parents, Liora and Eyal, and his older siblings Rotem and Yarden.\nThe youngest in his family, Amit was born and raised in Elyachin, a small town near Hadera. He was remembered for his cynical sense of humor and his love of playing soccer, according to an online eulogy.\nAmit was also very musically inclined, and he loved to sing and would also record songs, including one dedicated to his mother.\nAfter graduating high school, he enlisted in the IDF in August 2022, insistent on serving in the Golani Brigade – and he achieved his goal. He completed his “beret march” with a stuffed monkey attached to his pack – and since his death his comrades have kept a similar monkey with them in memorial.\n“Everyone who knew you knew how much joy you had, how much you loved to take advantage of every moment in life, every day for you was a holiday,” his mother, Liora, wrote on Instagram.\n“We were so close, that I knew everything about you, but regardless I am continuously hearing new stories about you, which inspire me,” she added.\nLiora said she and the family have been working tirelessly to memorialize Amit and tell his story, “about your brave actions and of course your admirable personality. I love you my dear son, you will always be engraved and preserved in my heart. We will continue to spread your light!”\nHis father, Eyal, told a local Hadera news outlet that Amit’s “presence is so missed, I miss everything about him. He was a social guy, an opinionated person who achieved everything he wanted but in a pleasant way.”\nEyal said when he would try to give Amit advice, “he’d always say to me, ‘Dad, don’t you trust me?’ When he would come home from the army he was exhausted but he’d always go get a haircut and then go immediately out to his friends. Friendship was of the highest importance to him.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Yigal Nissim Iluz, 56, a bomb sapper in the Israel Police’s Southern District, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of Ofakim.\nYigal, who was just a few months away from retirement, was working an overnight shift and was on his way to provide training in the Re’im area just when the attack started, and heard shortly afterward that terrorists had invaded Ofakim.\nYigal turned around and headed toward his home city. Not far from his home, he gathered with other police officers outside the house of Rachel and David Edry, who were being held captive by Hamas gunmen.\nWhile working to secure the scene, Yigal was shot dead by a sniper who fired from the second floor. The rest of the officers took cover and none of them were killed, and Rachel and David were ultimately rescued.\nHe was buried in Ofakim on October 9. He is survived by his wife, Ravit, their four children, Matan, Eden, Shilat and Noam, his mother Fanny, brother Mordechai and baby grandson, Liam.\nBorn in Jerusalem, Yigal attended the Naval Officers Boarding School in Acre for high school and then served in the Navy, according to a municipal eulogy.  In 1993 he enlisted in the Israel Police, serving for two years as a patrol officer before training as a sapper, a role he maintained for several decades.\nYigal was a huge fan of the Maccabi Haifa soccer team who loved cycling and working out, tending to his garden and most of all spending time with his family. He also volunteered as a police representative through the Jewish Agency to a Jewish community in New Jersey.\n“Yigal served for 30 years in the Israel Police, he was a very smart and professional guy and he always was looking a few steps ahead,” his wife, Ravit, told a sports site. “He was killed and with that saved everyone… he wanted to protect others, that was Yigal.”\nRavit said she has worked to memorialize her husband across Ofakim with large posters and artwork: “My Yigal was larger than life.

Thank you for getting up every morning and looking at me and saying, ‘Shula, there’s nothing to fear, Dad is always behind you.’ Or when I went out on a date you’d pretend you didn’t care but you’d be waiting up in the living room until I came home.”\n“In short Daddy – thank you for the privilege of being your daughter, the daughter of a king,” she wrote. “And thank you for leaving an entire empire behind you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 112 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

He and his comrades were flown via helicopter to the area of Kibbutz Alumim to join the fighting.\nAfter disembarking they marched toward Kibbutz Be’eri to join the battle against the Hamas invaders. For more than 30 hours, Ariel helped clear the kibbutz of terrorists and rescue besieged residents. On Sunday afternoon, he and his team entered the home of Maayan and Yuval Bar, who were murdered in the attack, to ensure there were no threats.\nAriel’s commander entered first and was shot and wounded, and when Ariel charged in afterward he was shot dead.\nHe was buried on October 11 in Revadim. He is survived by his parents, Liat and Yaniv, and his siblings Yoav, Gili and Shaked.\nBorn in Moshav Talmei Yehiel in central Israel, the second-oldest in the family, Ariel moved to Kibbutz Revadim in southern Israel as a baby.\nThere he grew up playing out in nature, tumbling through the scrap yard and spending time with the animals, his loved ones said, while also enjoying puzzles and building games. He attended elementary and high school in nearby Kibbutz Kfar Menachem.\nAriel loved playing both basketball and soccer and also dabbled in Capoeira, skiing, bike riding, ping pong, tennis and horseback riding, and was a participant and later leader in local youth groups.

    "story": "Carmel Gat, 40, from Kibbutz Be’eri, was kidnapped from her home on October 7 by Hamas terrorists. She was murdered in captivity in August 2024 and her body was recovered soon after by IDF troops and returned to Israel.\nCarmel was visiting her parents that holiday weekend when the Hamas onslaught began. Her mother, Kinneret Gat, was slain in the attack.\nHer sister-in-law, Yarden Roman-Gat, was also kidnapped during the attack, while Carmel’s brother Alon and the niece Geffen managed to escape before being captured. Yarden was released from captivity in November 2023 as part of a weeklong ceasefire deal.\nReleased hostages said they had spent time in captivity with Carmel, and that she had even done daily yoga with the younger hostages before they were freed.\nIn August 2024, Carmel was executed by her Hamas captors alongside fellow hostages Eden Yerushalmi, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Ori Danino, Almog Sarusi and Alex Lobanov. The IDF announced on September 1, 2024, that they had recovered their bodies in Rafah.\nAn investigation found that they were murdered by their captors just 48-72 hours before their bodies were found by troops, likely on August 29, 2024.\nCarmel was buried next to her mother in Kibbutz Be’eri on September 2, 2024. She is survived by her father, Eshel, and her younger brothers Alon and Or.\nBorn and raised in Kibbutz Be’eri, the oldest in the family, Carmel – known to friends as Melly – was a doting big sister who sought to instill a cultural education in her younger brothers, according to a kibbutz eulogy. She was opinionated, stuck to her guns and had a well-developed sense of justice, her loved ones said.\nAs a young adult she moved to Tel Aviv, living with roommates and meeting her longtime partner, Ruvi. She worked in a variety of jobs, delivering sandwiches to offices, serving as an aide to disabled university students and working as an au pair.\nEventually she got a bachelor’s degree in occupational therapy at Tel Aviv University and began working in the field. When she was killed, she was just about to start her second year in a master’s degree at Hebrew University in therapy and occupational therapy. She loved podcasts and music, as well as dancing and drinking wine along the beach.\nLess than six months before she was killed, she broke up with Ruvi after 14 years and traveled to India for several months – returning to Israel on October 1, 2023. That weekend, she was slated to reunite with her whole family – including her beloved niece.\n“The Carmel I knew was a woman of truth and compassion – you can see this even through the photos,” her friend Vita Kairys wrote in Haaretz. “The Carmel I knew constantly insisted on living the good life. Not in the bourgeois sense of material abundance, but in the sense of belonging and meaning.”\nVita said Carmel “made courageous choices in her personal life, not out of bluntness or a defiance, but rather out of curiosity and confidence in the world. When something didn’t work out, she simply went on to examine another possibility.”\nIn a eulogy read at her funeral, her brothers, Ori and Alon, spoke of “how much we need you here now to give us a hug. To look us in the eyes. To be with us. To give us strength.”\n“You brought so much beauty and light and variety and love to the world, to us,” they added. “We took so much inspiration from you. We drew so much strength from you, even when you weren’t physically with us.”\nHer brothers said they “miss your appetite for life – you loved to order a bunch of different dishes and taste everything, you loved to party and also go to sleep early after a day of giving it your all. Your ability to help others became your symbol and your hallmark.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Dor Toar, 27, from Mishmar Ayalon, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while fleeing the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHe attended the rave with four close childhood friends – Eden Moshe, Ben Binyamin Cohen, Tamar Gutman and Yiftah Tweg — who were all slain in the attack that day.\nWhen the rocket fire began, the friends split up, and Dor, Eden and Ben left via car, and were shot dead by Hamas terrorists lying in wait along the highway.\nIt took almost three weeks for Dor’s body to be identified, and he was buried in the Gezer Regional Cemetery outside Modiin on October 25. Ultimately, all five of the friends were buried side by side.\nDor is survived by his parents, Vered and Amir, and his sister, Gal. During the weeks that Dor was still considered missing, Gal gave birth to her first child, “a niece who Dor was waiting for so much that he’ll never get to meet,” his mother said.\nBorn and raised in Mishmar Ayalon, a small community near Modiin, Dor got into physical fitness from a young age, working out seriously from age 14 and learning about nutrition and anatomy. He later was certified as a personal trainer and started working in the field, and on his gravestone is even an etching of a man lifting weights.\nAfter his mandatory military service, Dor traveled around South America. After his travels, Dor studied electrical engineering at Tel Aviv University and worked at a coffee shop in Modiin. He loved spending time at the beach and excelled at footvolley.\n“Dor was always smiling with a lot of joy for life, a sense of humor and a good heart,” his mother, Vered, told a local site. He split his time between “workouts, work, studies, friends and family,” and had recently started a new relationship, she said.\n“He always found time to meet with friends, even after a night shift at the coffee shop,” she added, noting that his larger friend group was known as the “Tirasim,” (corns), named after Dor’s golden hair, and they all had a corn on the cob tattoo. “He was very charismatic, a leader, and loved by everyone.”\nDor’s sister, Gal, wrote on an Instagram memorial page that “as the days pass the feeling of longing and pain stays.”\n“I miss you so much, your loss is felt by me and all of us, if only I could hug you one more time,” she wrote. “If only I could tell you I love you one more time. If only you didn’t have to part from us… I know you’d want us to be happy, to laugh, to enjoy what we have, what’s here and now. That’s the thought that keeps me together and stops me from falling apart.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 115 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Sgt. Amir Eyal, 19, a surveillance balloon operator in the Border Defense Corps’s 414th unit, from Haifa, was killed on October 7 while battling the Hamas invasion of the IDF Nahal Oz outpost.\nAmir – who was stationed on guard duty – was one of five balloon operators on base that morning at the Nahal Oz post, along with Staff Sgt. Daniel Shperber, Sgt. Shimon Lugasi, Staff Sgt. Alroy Ben Shitrit and Staff Sgt. Neta Baram.\nThe five, who were responsible for operating a large white surveillance balloon that was supposed to collect information from deep inside Gaza, were waiting for a repair crew to arrive and fix the malfunctioning balloon when the Hamas invasion began.\nThe IDF has said it is investigating whether the balloons were merely malfunctioning or had been sabotaged by Hamas as part of its advance preparations for the onslaught.\n“We’re at war,” he texted his family WhatsApp group that morning. “They’re firing at us a ton… it’s going to end badly.”\nAmir was wounded in the initial attack and ran for shelter, where he joined up with his other four comrades. The five balloonists fought back against the mass invasion of the outpost by Hamas terrorists, but heavily outnumbered, all five were slain in the battle waged from inside an on-base shelter.\nAmir was buried in Haifa on October 13. He is survived by his parents Sharon and Shay, and his siblings Shahar and Shir.\nThe middle child in the family, Amir was born and raised in Haifa, attending local schools and pursuing a number of sporting loves, according to a eulogy on the Maccabi Haifa website.\nHe played basketball, tennis and ping pong and was also a devoted fan of the Maccabi Haifa basketball and soccer teams, cheering them on at every opportunity, and also enjoyed catching NBA games. He also had two beloved cats named after pudding cups, Milky and Carlo.\nAfter finishing high school, Amir enlisted in the IDF in August 2022, and after his basic training was stationed as a balloonist at Nahal Oz, a position his loved ones said he enjoyed.\nMarom, his commander during basic training, said she could see “that his values came from a good home,” according to a local Haifa news site. “He always had the best manners in every situation, even when he was stressed or things were needed immediately, he always respected those around him, helped everyone and volunteered for everything he could.”\nHis father, Shay,  told the Kan public broadcaster that “Amir was a big homebody, he would come home from the army – [he was] a kid who loved his big duvet and his cats and chocolate chip cookies, he loved all the creature comforts.”\nAmir “loved to sit in bed with his cell phone,” he added, and the pair would also regularly relax together on the couch in front of a sporting game and enjoy a hamburger. “He wasn’t looking to be in [an elite unit], but he enjoyed the fact that he was a combat soldier and was on the Gaza border – he loved his job as a balloonist.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Yoram Metzger, 80, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists on October 7. In June 2024, the IDF confirmed that Yoram had been slain in captivity.\nIn August 2024, his body was recovered by IDF troops from Gaza and returned to Israel for burial, alongside those of Yagev Buchshtav, Nadav Popplewell, Avraham Munder, Chaim Peri and Alex Dancyg. An IDF investigation determined that the six were shot dead by their captors in mid-February 2024.\nYoram was kidnapped from his home along with his wife, Tami Metzger. Tami was freed on November 28, 2023, as part of a weeklong ceasefire-hostage release deal.\nHe was buried in Kibbutz Nir Oz on August 22, 2024. He is survived by his wife, Tami, their three sons Guy, Rani and Nir, and seven grandchildren.\nBorn in Petah Tikva, following his older sister Aviva, Yoram served his mandatory military service in the Nahal Brigade and did regular reserve duty, including during the Six Day War and the Yom Kippur War. He spoke Yiddish from his parents and later picked up Arabic as well, which survivors said helped him connect to his Hamas captors.\nHe met Tami while working as a youth pioneer on Kibbutz Amiad in the north, marrying in 1965 and living happily together for close to 59 years. Their first two children were born in Petah Tikva, and in 1974 they settled in Nir Oz, where they remained for almost 50 years – except for a few years when they lived in the Netherlands. As was common on the kibbutz, he was always known simply as “Metzger.”\nYoram worked for many years at the kibbutz’s Nirlat paint factory, and more recently in the kibbutz garage. He was described by loved ones as an excellent cook – who always had a jar of homemade pickles on hand – humorous, a lover of history and a dedicated drinker of the Nir Oz winery’s cellar and amateur winemaker.\nAt his funeral, his son Nir said, “Everyone here knows you from a different point of view – from the army, from work, from the kibbutz and more… but I’ll talk about Metzger the cook: cholent on Shabbat in the winter, a factory of pickles, and if you stood too close you’d find yourself inside a jar.”\nNir added, “You taught us so much, mostly how to speak with confidence, even when we don’t know what we’re saying. After all, we’re Metzgers.” And as a friend, he said, “You were always there for your friends. You had the ability to hold onto relationships for decades… If anyone needed help, you’d stand by them no matter what, even if you hadn’t seen or spoken to them in years.”\nSpeaking at his funeral, his granddaughter, Amit, said that “things were never boring with him. On the backdrop of the coffee and the crossword on the balcony, it was a bit of a surprise to sometimes hear a sentence in Yiddish or fluent Arabic.”\nHe’d tell stories about his experiences in the war, “entering the Western Wall in 1967 or the Suez Canal in 1973, and we’d realize how rich and interesting and full of history his life was,” she said.\n“Grandpa Yoram really loved to cook,” she added. “He’d always tell me that I had a creative mind and therefore I’d be a great cook… Grandpa was a big talker – he could tell us stories for hours, and as soon as he realized we were interested he’d get even more excited.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

When his daughter called and told him of the Hamas invasion, he decided to set off toward his kibbutz, located in the south near Kibbutz Nir Oz, in order to help join the battle.\nHe was last heard from around 10 a.m. before all communication was cut off. His car was later found near Magen, but he was nowhere to be seen, and his loved ones believed he had been kidnapped.\nAfter close to 10 days, his family was informed that his body had been found.\nAs a member of the kibbutz’s local security team, he was posthumously recognized as a fallen soldier with the rank of sergeant major in the reserves. His fellow local security officer, Avi Fleisher, was also killed that day while battling inside Magen. Two other local security officers were wounded, and everyone else in the kibbutz was saved.\nOfir’s funeral was held in Petah Tikva on October 17 and he was buried in Magen. He is survived by his wife, Olga, their two daughters, Emma, 18, and Dana, 12, and his five siblings.\nTwo weeks after his funeral, Ofir’s father, Aryeh, died. His mother, Carmela, had died in 2017.\nHis nephew, Shlomi Samocha, wrote that the news of Ofir’s death after 10 days of searching “broke our heart, and broke a little bit of the spirit that was carrying us like a leaf in the wind.”\n“Hug the rainbow, now that you’re close, and Aunt Carmela, and send strength to those of us left here,” he added.

He was slain alongside Yesha local security team members Gil Avital and Lior Ben Yaakov, and Mivtahim residents Dan Asulin and Tal Maman.\nItay was buried on October 11 in Tzohar. He is survived by his parents, Galit and Oded David, his brothers, Aviv and Or, and his sister Shelly.\nBorn in the Livne settlement in the South Hebron Hills, Itay moved as a young child to Omer, near Beersheba, and then at age 5 to Kibbutz Re’im before eventually settling in Yesha, according to an IDF eulogy. He attended school in nearby Kibbutz Magen, specializing in physics, chemistry and math.\nItay enlisted in the IDF in December 2021, intent on joining an elite combat unit after years of preparing himself physically for the challenge. He joined the elite Multidomain “Ghost” Unit, which was only established in 2019, and threw himself into the role.\nHe was described by family and friends as a man of action who researched everything that interested him in depth until he possessed a deep understanding of it. He worked out regularly and was an active wrestler who also enjoyed cooking and motorsports and learned how to build and repair vehicles.\n“We all grew up in a house where we ride motorbikes and ATVs, but Itay took it to the extreme because he liked to mend them as well as ride them,” said his brothers Aviv and Or. “He had an incredible technical instinct and by the age of 10, he’d already gained the knowledge and professionalism to leave us all behind.”\nHis mother, Galit, who works as a midwife, told the Kan public broadcaster in August that it was clear to her that she would continue working because bringing life into the world would be her way of remembering Itay.\nIn March, she said, she delivered Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh’s niece’s baby because she would not let him break her.\n“Bringing life into the world is emotional, and there are some births where I feel Itay standing with me, supporting me, and pushing me forward,” she said, adding that Itay was stubborn and couldn’t be dissuaded from whatever he set his mind to. “I hope that the babies I deliver won’t need to fight for their lives and all there is left is hope.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

During 11th and 12th grade he took part in the “Atidim” program to take more advanced classes in math and English.\nAfter finishing high school, Yevgeni enlisted in the IDF and served in the military police at the Natan Camp near Beersheba, tasked with investigating accidents.\nFollowing his release, he began a bachelor’s degree in computer science at Ben Gurion University, while working at Mobileye to fund his studies. He and his girlfriend, Aviv, met while they were both traveling in Sri Lanka and discovered that they were both students at BGU. He completed his degree just a few months before he was killed.\nYevgeni and Lior also attended the rave together with Noa Argamani, who was kidnapped to Gaza and rescued by IDF troops in June 2024. After her return, Noa eulogized her friends on social media, writing that they were “my friends, my partners in life and parties and jokes, for good and bad.”\nShe wrote that she only found out about their murders after her return to Israel – “and how can I return to a reality that you’re not part of? You were an inseparable part of my life, each of you in their own way… I’ll always remember you as the happy people you were, with a huge smile and wide heart. Thank you for all the shared moments you gave me, all the experiences, Friday night dinners, parties, life lessons and help in university studies.”\nYevgeni’s girlfriend, Aviv, wrote online that he was “my home, my best friend. The best friend anyone could ever ask for.”\n“When we just met, I couldn’t believe that I found someone who has everything, who had the perfect balance between ambition and seriousness and the ability to enjoy life and take things easily,” Aviv added.\n“Yevgeni was a person with a pure heart, a sensitive and caring guy who always thought about others,” she continued. “The first to offer help with all his heart, the friend who will stand by you no matter when and push you to be the best version of yourself. He was beloved, funny and engaging and got along with everyone, everywhere he went.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 121 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

Five days later, John’s family was informed that he had been killed. A week later, after completing the shiva mourning period, they were told that Robert was also found dead.\nJohn was buried in Ashdod on October 12. He is survived by his wife, Inna, their three children, Sergio, Stas and Shoshi, and several grandchildren.\nBorn in Russia, John had two older sisters and two younger sisters. He and Inna wed in the city of Pyatigorsk on October 7, 1977 and they had three children. John was an industrial engineer by training.\nIn the 1990s, they decided to move to Israel, living first for a few years in Ramat Gan before settling in Ashdod. Inna’s brother, Robert – a childhood friend of John’s – decided to move to Israel in 2016 and settle nearby.\nHis daughter, Shoshi, told the Davar news outlet that “my father really loved nature. As a child he would take me to pick fruits and vegetables, I would bring friends with me. I’d say ‘OK, who wants to come with me today to collect mushrooms in the forest.’ Our shared moments together were the perfect entertainment,” she said, recalling family camping and fishing trips.\n“He knew the season of every fruit, when was the right time to harvest pomegranates or clementines, and he would pick in the orchards near the house, organize them in bags and give them out to all the kids.”\nShoshi said her father “was always there for me. A very simple guy, modest, but rich in life experience, knowledge and education. He demanded that we be good to others, find shared dialogue, to know how to find the good in everyone.”\nHer father “pushed us to advance in life, to succeed, to go study, not to be average. I never once saw him complain, his motto was that we need to be strong, life is no picnic and we have to be strong.”\nReturning to Zikim Beach nine months after his father was killed, John’s son, Sergio, told the Kan public broadcaster that “Dad died in the place he loved most, the sea… I’d give everything just to sit with him for a few minutes, just to show him the fish that I caught.

When the rocket fire began, they left via car but were stopped at a police roadblock, which directed them instead to a roadside bomb shelter near Kibbutz Alumim.\nInside the shelter, Yonatan called his mother and told her they were under attack, telling her that there was no army or police to save them: “Take care of yourself, I don’t know if I’ll make it out alive,” he said in the conversation, which was cut off by an explosion.\nYonatan was slain by a grenade thrown inside the shelter by Hamas terrorists. He was protecting his girlfriend with his body, and she managed to survive the attack and was later rescued.\nAfter five days of searching, his family was informed that his body had been identified. His close friend – who he had attended the rave with –  Eliya Cohen, was kidnapped from a different shelter and is still held captive in Gaza.\nYonatan was buried in Jerusalem on October 11. He is survived by his mother, Linda, and his siblings Oshri, Tehila, Kfir and Daniel. His father, Yaakov, died of cancer when Yonatan was 7 years old.\nBorn and raised in the Nahlaot neighborhood of Jerusalem, Yonatan was the fourth-oldest in the family, attending local schools and growing up in the alleyways of the nearby Mahane Yehuda market, even working as a teenager in the local Marzipan bakery. He was also a devoted fan of the Beitar Jerusalem soccer team and would never miss a game.\nYonatan’s father worked for the Netanyahu family as a driver for many years, and Yonatan was named after Yoni Netanyahu, the brother of Benjamin Netanyahu who was killed during the 1976 Operation Entebbe. Benzion Netanyahu, Benjamin’s father, was the sandak at Yonatan’s brit mila, according to a state eulogy, and the prime minister and his wife were both in attendance.\nSara Netanyahu paid a condolence call to the family, and said that “Yonatan was a marvelous and beautiful boy… a true friend of everyone. Even in his last hours, he bravely and heroically fought to save lives. I will always remember him, his smile, his love of life.”\nAfter graduating high school, Yonatan served as a combat soldier in the Kfir Brigade, eventually becoming a deputy logistics commander of his company. After his release, Yonatan sought to enjoy life to the fullest, traveling abroad, attending festivals in Israel and overseas, including several trips to India, where he would always bring his favorite Marzipan rugelach with him.\n“Yoni was a guy who loved life, loved festivals abroad,” his brother, Kfir, told a local Jerusalem news site. “For him, ‘a day that passes never returns.’ He loved to say that.”\nKfir said Yoni was a party animal, “and as his older brother I would tell him to focus, but he would always tell me… ‘let me enjoy a little bit longer, I’m young.’”\nYoni, he said, “was a man of faith, he loved religion and God. He was a happy guy… he always told us that life was short and this is the time to enjoy.

Or Malka was on a video call with his girlfriend. Emil, Or and Cpl. Lidor Mekayes were slain when the Hamas invaders attacked the shelter. Cpl. Nik Beizer and Sgt.

    "story": "Lt. Yuval Yoffe, 21, a platoon commander in the 7th Armored Brigade, from Tzofit, was killed on October 11, 2023, in fighting near Kibbutz Kissufim.\nYuval was at home on break with the start of the Hamas onslaught on October 7, and was called back to base at the Shizafon training camp in the south. Yuval and his comrades took part in the battle against the Hamas invaders for several days along the border and in hard-hit communities.\nHe last spoke with his parents on Tuesday evening, and expressed satisfaction that he had been able to be a part of the operations to defend against the Hamas attack. The next morning, four days after the start of the attack, Yuval was killed next to Kibbutz Kissufim.\nHe was buried in Tzofit on October 13. He is survived by his parents, Yoram and Ossi, and his older siblings Shahar and Omri.\nBorn and raised in Tzofit, a small community near Kfar Saba, Yuval was the youngest in the family. From a young age he loved music and soccer, and was a devout fan of the Hapoel Kfar Saba and Liverpool soccer teams, according to an IDF eulogy. He also played the sport for many years, until a knee injury at age 17.\nYuval attended the Tavor pre-military academy in the Galilee while he sought to heal from the injury and find the right IDF path forward. In December 2021 he enlisted in the IDF and joined the Armored Brigade, later training as a tank commander, completing officer’s training and eventually being appointed a platoon commander a few months before his death.\nHis family said Yuval loved his country and exploring its environs, spending time at fresh springs, hiking around with his guitar and his campstove for coffee. Giving back to the state was deeply important to him, and he viewed his military service with great meaning.\n“We always said to him, ‘What, you’re going to be an officer now?’ All your friends will be released and send you pictures from Thailand,'” Yuval’s brother, Shahar, told Ynet. “He always had a saying along the way — ‘Those who can, must.’ I really think it’s one of the things that best characterized him.”\nShahar added, “When we talk about Yuval, we talk about his smile, which was impossible not to fall in love with in a second. It’s a smile that really epitomized him.

    "story": "Oz Ezra Moshe, 23, from Holon, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHe attended the rave with his girlfriend, Naomie Bikhar, and the pair tried to flee the festival grounds together in a car with Adiel Twito and Amit Buskila. Adiel was murdered and Amit was also slain and her body kidnapped to Gaza.\nOz was shot in the shoulder, and he and Naomie then got in a car with Motti Zoherman and Keshet Casarotti-Kalfa. Naomie was trying to stop his bleeding when terrorists approached them — while they were on a video call with family — and asked if they had a weapon. Naomie said no, and they immediately opened fire, killing all four of them.\nOz was buried on October 10 in Holon. He is survived by his parents, Rachel and Meir, and his four older siblings, Yoni, Moshe, Florin and Daizy.\nThe youngest in the family, Oz was born and raised in Holon, attending local schools. He was always interested in electronics, and worked as a cellphone technician, according to a municipal eulogy.\nHe was a devoted soccer fanatic, an ardent fan of the Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv team, filling his room with scarves and t-shirts expressing his devotion, and attended every game, including those abroad, his family said. He was very close to his family, always loving to play with his nieces and nephews and young cousins.\nHe also loved music and music festivals, was always the star of every karaoke party. Just a few months before he was killed, he attended the Ozora music festival in Hungary.\nOz and Naomie had been together for three years and were planning a life together, their loved ones said, talking about moving in together, a wedding, children and what their shared future would look like.\nMarking 100 days since he was killed, Oz’s older sister, Daizy, lamented, “100 days that you no longer dream dreams, 100 days that you’re no longer trying to achieve them.”\n“So much has changed, if only I could share with you some of the things that happened when you weren’t here,” she added. “With time I’ve learned that time doesn’t really heal anything — it only sharpens the painful and insane reality that you will stay a child of 23 forever, and I’ll never feel your enveloping hug or hear your rolling laughter again.”\nIn April, Oz’s brother Moshe marked “six months without your smile, six months without our joking together, six months that our heart is no longer whole, six months that the world stopped and doesn’t move, six months that you’re not with us — I love you my brother, I’ll never forget you.”\nHis mother, Rachel, wrote on Facebook, “Oz my righteous man, my true angel, my life — I miss you so much.”\n“Not a day goes by that I don’t mention you and just cry from longing,” she continued. “I want to know that things are good for you — come to me in a dream and tell me how you are.”\nRachel said that Oz “loved to play with kids, that was your life, and I never got to see you have children, I wanted grandchildren from you so much.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

After he realized that terrorists had arrived at the festival grounds, Amit said he was hiding and couldn’t talk.\nHis connection with his family was cut off at 9:21 a.m. Two days later, his family was informed that he had been killed and his body identified.\nAmit was buried in Ness Ziona on October 9. He is survived by his parents, Anat and Haim, and his siblings Noy, Aviv and Agam.\nBorn in Rishon Lezion, the third child in the family, Amit moved to Ness Ziona as a baby and was raised there, attending schools in the city, focusing on theater studies, according to a state eulogy.\nAt age 13, Amit began to train as a wrestler, something he later pursued professionally. After his release from his mandatory army service — during which he served a fitness instructor — Amit flew to Germany for a monthlong wrestling training camp.\nUpon his return, he got a job as a manager at a clothing store. At age 19, he was exposed to the world of music festivals and trance music, falling in love and learning music production, dreaming of one day performing on stages around the world.\nLidor Bushary, who trained Amit in wrestling for many years, wrote on Facebook that “Amit was a shining star in the Israeli wrestling scene, always displaying his remarkable skills and sportsmanship. But more than that, he was a beacon of free love and positivity, bringing smiles to all who crossed his path… His bright smile and warm spirit will forever be etched in our hearts.”\nAmit’s mother, Anat, wrote on Facebook that “too many days have passed since I heard your voice, since I heard your laughter, since I saw your smile that everyone talks about, and it’s been too long since I smelled your scent.”\n“My Amiti, the days are so hard, my heart is shattered and bleeding, but I always hear you tell me, ‘My Mamaleh, you’re strong, you’re a warrior mother.'” wrote Anat. “Yes Amiti, I am a warrior, I’m strong, but I also break sometimes, but I promise you that I’ll keep being strong for your brother and sisters, for the whole family, for your friends but mostly for you, my love.

    "story": "Doron Boldas, 34, from Gan Hashomron, was murdered on October 7 after being kidnapped from the Supernova music festival by Hamas terrorists.\nDoron was working at the rave that morning at a food stand. When the rocket fire began, he began to close down the stand and pack up the equipment since the festival was shut down. Piecing together his final moments from video, evidence and testimony, his family believes that Doron — after helping treat wounded at the site of the rave — left via car and headed in the direction of Be’eri.\nNear the kibbutz, he was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists and placed in the back of a pickup truck with others being kidnapped from Be’eri. But days later, Doron’s body was found near the border with Gaza, and his family believes he got in a fight with a Hamas terrorist and was shot dead and his body dumped.\nDoron was buried in Gan Hashomron on October 11. He is survived by his parents, Yehudit and Moshe, and his sisters Shay and Liran.\nBorn and raised in Gan Hashomron, a small town near Hadera in central Israel, Doron was the oldest in his family. As a kid he was an active ping pong player, even winning a national youth championship, according to a state eulogy.\nDoron was a chef with a specialty in meats, and he would regularly run food stands at festivals and events around Israel, including the 2019 Eurovision in Tel Aviv. He opened his own smokeshop station at a horse farm in Kibbutz Ramot Menashe in the north and also worked at a restaurant in Holon. His longtime dream was to open his own food truck of smoked meats.\nIzik Biton, who worked with Doron that day at the festival, wrote in testimony about realizing they were under attack from more than just rockets. He said, “I tell Doron that I’m getting out of here now and plead that he does the same, but because of his big heart, he insists on hitching the food truck, since he lent it from a close friend.”\n“Doron Boldas, friend, chef, you who looked like a Viking but would never hurt the tip of a fly’s wing, with the purest heart and laugh and willingness to give, and our conversations,” he wrote. “Dear God, we had just slept outside together for three days, we worked together, laughed, had fun, I can’t breathe.”\nTo commemorate his memory, his sister, Shay, opened up a smoked meat food truck at the entrance to their hometown, called Meshek Boldas, which tells his life story and his dreams.\n“My brother was a champion when it comes to meat and he dreamed of a smoked meat food truck for a long time,” Shay told the Haaretz newspaper. “He had even submitted an application for a license to the municipality, but it was rejected. Already during the shiva [mourning period] I said that there was no way I wasn’t going to open the food truck that he dreamed of. That there was no way I wasn’t passing along his love.”\nShay said Doron “was really worth of admiration, he loved to help people and was always full of optimism. I never encountered him crying or annoyed, he was always satisfied by life and everything he encountered. He had a sort of calm that you could never disrupt, a calm that I hope stayed with him until the end.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Command Sgt. Maj. Yehuda Kadar, 50, a non-commissioned Border Police officer at the Eshkol Ein Habesor station, from Ofakim, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nYehuda was at home with his family with the start of the attack, but soon received many messages and updates about the Hamas onslaught. He quickly put on his uniform and headed for the front lines, collecting another police officer along the way. Their goal was to get to the Ein Habesor station and get suited up with better equipment for combat.\nAlong the way, they encountered a cell of Hamas terrorists and exchanged gunfire, with an RPG just missing them in the battle. At Ein Habesor, Yehuda unlocked the weapons locker and armed the town’s local security team with rifles, helping them hold off an attack on the town.\nYehuda then decided to continue onward toward Kibbutz Re’im to come to the assistance of a wounded officer who had called for help. Along the way they encountered another group of Hamas gunmen and Yehuda was killed in the gun battle.\nHe was buried on October 9 in Ofakim. He is survived by his wife, Iris, their two children, Eliya and Aviad, his mother, Malka, and six siblings: Esther, Benny, Moshe, Avi, Yaakov and Ruth. He was predeceased by his father, Yehoshua, and his brother, Eli.\nBorn and raised in a large family in Ofakim, Yehuda attended local schools, according to a municipal eulogy. In 1991 he enlisted in the IDF, serving in the Border Police, and after completing his mandatory service, he signed on in 1994 to remain in the police force.\nYehuda was deeply family oriented, his loved ones said, and loved to regularly gather together his extended family, including for a big 50th birthday bash just months before he was killed. He also volunteered in an old age home as well as with kids with special needs, his family said.\nHis daughter, Eliya, wrote on an Instagram memorial page that “when the battle started, my dad was exactly where he always was, on the front line, defending home, defending us.”\nHer father, she wrote, “wasn’t just a Border Police fighter. He was a dad, he was a husband, he was a friend. The man with the warmest eyes, always asking if we were OK, always there when we needed, he would talk to us about everything, advise us on everything, and always knew what to say.”\n“He instilled in us the values he believed in,” she added. “He was the man in whom you could see light, the man who you are sure will find a solution to everything… He fought because there was no choice, he fought to defend our home, the country, our family.”\nHis wife, Iris, told a local news outlet, “Yehuda taught us that it’s important to be an important person, but it’s more important to be a decent person.” His son, Aviad, told the news site, “Dad was always my role model. Now, I want to continue his path in the Border Police, so that he’ll be proud of me.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Ram Shalom, 24, from Givat Ze’ev, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while trying to flee the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nRam attended the rave with a large group of revelers, including his close childhood friend Idan Dor.\nWhen they realized that Hamas terrorists had attacked the rave, they headed for their car and tried to escape the site of the festival. Ram told his mother that they were leaving the rave and not to worry. At 9:30 a.m., Idan told his sister the pair were hiding, and that was the last that was heard from them.\nAfter five days of waiting and searching, Ram’s family was informed that his body had been identified. Officers told his mother that he and Idan had been slain trying to fight back against the Hamas gunmen.\nRam was buried in Jerusalem on October 15 — alongside his best friend Idan. He is survived by his mother, Nurit, and his older brother, Tom. His father, Dan, died when Ram was 14.\nBorn in Jerusalem, Ram attended schools in the capital and in Givat Ze’ev, including the Denmark High School in Jerusalem. For more than a decade he played soccer on local teams, including Hapoel Katamon, according to a state eulogy.\nRam deliberated enlisting the IDF under the category of athlete, to enable him to keep playing, but instead he chose to join the Paratroopers Brigade, later completing a platoon commander’s course. After his release, Ram worked as a security guard with Israel Railways and later spent several months touring South America. After returning he got a job as a porter at the Ben Gurion Airport.\nIdan and Ram were rarely far from each other — they went to the same high school, played on the same soccer team and later worked together at the airport — and were killed together at the Supernova festival and buried side by side.\nHis mother said Ram had plans to study electrical engineering and to live and work alongside his brother, Tom, in Miami. Ram and Nurit had only returned from a trip to Florida a few days before he was killed, and Ram was already planning his return.\nNurit told a local Jerusalem news site that “he admired me and I admired him. Ram was my oxygen. Everything he did he would seek my advice and vice versa. He never argued with me, always spoke respectfully and pleasantly. He was very mature, something his friends can attest to.”\nShe described her son as “bashful with an amazing smile, he loved to help others. He was the one who would connect friends together, he was light. They would always hang out at our house. He had a huge heart. He was a person who wanted only to do good, he didn’t know how to speak badly of others.\nNurit said if Ram ever “heard me saying something out of place, he would tell me not to speak that way… I can’t believe that I’ll never hear his voice again or speak to him again… I’m still waiting for him to call me ‘Mom,’ and I still can’t comprehend that it won’t ever happen again.”\nHis older brother, Tom, wrote on Facebook on what would have been Ram’s 25th birthday, to “a boy whose whole life was ahead of him.”\nTom recalled the time they had recently spent together in Miami: “The laughter, the experiences, the conversations just between you and me, if only we had had more time… we may live in different worlds today, but my beloved brother, our memories are eternal and live on everywhere in both worlds.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 133 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Alex (Olesh) Dancyg, 75, was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7 and brought to Gaza. In July 2024, the IDF confirmed that Alex had been killed in the Strip.\nIn August 2024, his body was recovered from a tunnel in Khan Younis along with the bodies of five others — Yagev Buchshtav, Nadav Popplewell, Avraham Munder, Chaim Peri and Yoram Metzger. An IDF investigation determined that the six were shot dead by their captors in mid-February 2024.\nAlex was buried in Kibbutz Nir Oz on August 25, 2024. He is survived by his four children, Yuval, Matti, Ben and Lee, and many grandchildren.\nBorn in Warsaw, Poland, in 1948, to Holocaust survivors Nina and Marcin, Alex moved to Israel with his parents and older sister, Edith, in 1957. He was a member of the left-wing Labor Zionist youth group Hashomer Hatzair, served in the IDF in the Paratroopers Brigade and eventually settled in Nir Oz, where he raised four children with his then-wife, Rachel and was involved in the kibbutz’s agriculture.\nAlex got a degree in history from Ben Gurion University and worked as a history teacher until a trip back to Poland in 1986 — for the first time since he had left in 1957 — kindled a keen interest in Holocaust history and education. In 1990 he began working with the Yad Vashem Museum at the Education Ministry to train guides for youth trips to Poland and Polish educators, clergy and police officers, and became a world-renowned Holocaust historian and expert in the field, including writing several books.\nIn a video of a talk he gave not long before his death, Alex described himself: “I am born in Poland, a Polish kid, the son of survivors of the Holocaust in Warsaw, and other places, son of a historical family of great rabbis from Vilna, and I am culturally poor… a Jew with deep roots and an Israeli patriot. Is it possible? Yes. I want the kids to understand that life is complicated.”\nInbal Kvity Ben-Dov, an executive at Yad Vashem, wrote in an online tribute about their shared “funny, moving, irritating, and educational moments — memories of the fiery redhead you were, even when your hair turned white. We experienced ups and downs in our joint work, and you were always wise and witty, charismatic and articulate, knowledgeable, yet also grumpy and irritable, and perpetually hungry. Not just for a good meal, drink or some salted nuts, you were hungry for a new survivor’s testimony, a captivating book to discuss for hours, for new experiences, and for challenging philosophical ideas.”\nAfter his death was announced, his son Yuval wrote on Instagram that “this isn’t how it was supposed to end.”\n“You were abducted alive and breathing from your bed on that cursed morning, and you should have returned home alive and in one piece. I’m sorry we didn’t succeed in this task,” wrote Yuval. “In the last few months, I was exposed more and more to the number of people you inspired and to what an amazing legacy you left behind. I promise to carry this legacy with me to every place and to tell your story.”\nFollowing the retrieval of Alex’s body, his son, Matty told the Kan public broadcaster that his father was “one of the founders” of the now widely accepted trips for Israeli youth to Poland in high school.\n“He dedicated much of his life to this, he worked for many years with Yad Vashem, he established a lot of dialogue with groups of Polish Jews, tried to explain the point of view of Polish citizens in a more accurate and historical and less stereotypical way,” said Matty. At the same time, Alex worked in agriculture in the kibbutz, where he lived for more than 50 years, he said.\n“He was a very smart guy, very warm, loved his family, he was the person I had the most fun speaking with, he had so much knowledge, and he was always very interesting,” he added. “I miss him so much… it’s important to me that the legacy he worked to instill, of Holocaust education and nuanced history will continue.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

When the rocket fire began, he attempted to help people safely leave the site of the festival, even though his shift had been slated to end at 6:30 a.m.\nWhen he and other police officers realized that Hamas gunmen were attacking people along the highway, they set up a roadblock to attempt to slow them down and allow partygoers to flee. Malik and many other officers fought back against the terrorists and were ultimately slain in the battle.\nHe was buried in Dimona on October 10. He is survived by his wife, Yana, their two children, Daniel and Anabel, and his mother, Mina. His father, Malik, died before he was born.\nBorn in Derbent, Russia, Malik moved to Israel with his mother in 1994, at age 3. They settled in Dimona where he attended local schools.\nHe served in the Border Police and later in the Prisons Service during his mandatory IDF service, and in February 2013 he enlisted in the Israel Police, serving in the southern district.\nHis friend and colleague Enas Abu Wasel wrote on Facebook that she was “still waiting every day for you to come up the stairs and shout, ‘Hello commander, I’ve arrived.'”\n“I’m waiting for our conversations, for your smile, your pure heart — you knew only how to love and to help,” she added. “How can I imagine the days without you coming and making me happy?”\nYana wrote on Facebook that she and Malik met when she was 19 and he was 21, introduced after her mother had met his mother during a visit to Israel: “I can’t put into words what we felt when we first met.”\n“Two months later Malik proposed to me and I said ‘yes.’ I couldn’t imagine my life without him,” she said. “So I moved to Israel and started learning Hebrew. Malik joined the police force since he had always dreamt of being a policeman. Everything was so wonderful. We lived well and took care of our two kids, Daniel and Anabel.”\n“On October 6, he put on his uniform, kissed the family goodbye and left for work,” Yana recounted. When she called him amid the attack, she “heard a distressed and shaking voice. He said he couldn’t talk… I could only imagine what Malik had to go through.”\nMalik, she said, was “an amazing man, who we learned later on, helped save civilians but couldn’t save himself. Every night, I have the same dream. Malik comes home and says: ‘I’m alive Yana, everything is alright.'”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Cpt. Etai Cohen, 22, a commander in the special forces Yahalom unit in the Combat Engineering Corps, from Rehovot, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas attack on Kibbutz Alumim.\nOff duty that weekend — hours after returning from a family trip to Cyprus — Etai immediately jumped into action when he heard of the attack, and rounded up his team to head down south before they were even called up.\nHis sister, Ofek, texted him around 10 a.m. and asked how he was feeling, in response he texted: “There are no feelings, just responsibility. Something happened here that should never have happened” — a sentence that his family has used to memorialize him around the world.\nEtai was killed battling a cell of Hamas gunmen in Kibbutz Alumim.\nHe was buried on October 10 in Rehovot. He is survived by his parents, Ortal and Yaniv, and his siblings Ofek and Noam.\nBorn in Maryland in the US, Etai moved to Israel with his family when he was 6 months old. The oldest of his siblings, Etai grew up in Rehovot, where he attended local schools, focusing his high school studies on robotics and physics. He also played basketball with a local team — which added “Etai” to its name to honor him after his death.\nHis family said one of his dreams was to fly to the US to see Israeli NBA star Deni Avdija play a basketball game; after his death, Avdija paid tribute to Cohen in his first post-October 7 game by writing his name on his shoes. Among the plans they found after his death, Etai had also written about his desires to see Lebron James play, to watch a Formula 1 race and to attend concerts by Drake and Billie Eilish, his family told Maariv.\nIn December 2019 he enlisted in the IDF, in the elite Yahalom unit in the Combat Engineering Course. He later underwent an officer’s course, and signed up to stay an additional four years in the military past the mandatory period, which would include training with the US army, obtaining a bachelor’s degree and taking up a role as a company commander.\nHis father, Yaniv, told Army Radio that Etai was “a wonderful kid, who grew up here in Rehovot, a mature kid with good values, sociable, went out to give back to the country, to have a meaningful military service, and that’s how he got to Yahalom.”\nAsked how he wanted Etai to be remembered, Yaniv said “the way he was — all his close friends who knew him well [remembered him] as a top-notch man, a loyal friend, who knew how to laugh but also to be serious. A smart guy, who loved sports.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 136 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Sgt. Maj. (res.) Liran Mones Almosnino, 42, from Kmehin, a reservist with the LOTAR counter-terror regional Nitzana team, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nLiran was home with his family the morning of the attack in Kmehin, a small community in the western Negev not far from the border with Egypt.\nWhen he got word of the Hamas invasion, he and other members of the rapid-response counter-terrorism team based in the Nitzana bloc of communities on the Egypt border got into a van and headed to join the fighting. They went first to Yated, near the southern Gaza border, where they battled Hamas gunmen and where Cpt. (res.) Iftach Gorny was killed.\nLater Liran and his comrades continued to Kibbutz Holit, which had been invaded by Hamas gunmen. Liran was shot dead while trying to battle the onslaught.\nHe was buried on October 12 in Kadesh Barnea (Nitzanei Sinai). He is survived by his wife, Efrat, their five children, Guy, Geva, Peleg, Tene and Matar, his parents, Sari and Michael and his siblings Shahar and Hen.\nBorn in Hatzor, a kibbutz near Ashdod, Liran grew up in a military family with a pilot father whose work took him around the world. They lived for a period in the United States, before later settling in Reut, near Modiin, where Liran attended high school.\nHe and his wife Efrat had a lifelong dream of raising their family on a farm and living off the land. In 2016 they settled in Kmehin where they raised a flock of sheep together and also started a tourist business taking people on jeep tours of the desert and sandboarding.\nIn an interview with Ynet in March 2023 about their rural life, Liran said he wanted to live in the desert “because I had a dream. We had a business for rental equipment for events, but we sold it and came to Kmehim because I wanted to raise sheep… Why specifically sheep? I don’t know, I just really love the animal.”\nLiran also did regular reserve duty in the IDF, was an active volunteer with a local group providing protection against the stealing of animals from farms and was a member of the LOTAR counter-terror group for the communities next to the Nitzana border crossing with Egypt.\nHis mother, Sari, wrote on Facebook about his final moments, “When you were called up, put on your uniform and went to do what you knew how to do — defend your home, defend this country you loved so much.”\n“Liran, your loss has opened a deep hole in my heart,” she added. “The pain is endless and unimaginable… I am proud of you my heroic son. Proud and thankful for the privilege of being your mother.”\nHis wife, Efrat, told the Mako news site that “Liran was the kid who was in all the after-school scouting troops, who learned all the knots and the bindings, who knew the trees and the types of rocks and knew how people used to live.”\nLiran was “a child of nature in every meaning of the word, who grew up to be a man of nature full of magic. He was always ready to help, even at the expense of the kids at home, the first to jump into action and assist, to bring, to organize or to rescue, even without being asked, always ready for any task.”\nHer husband, she said, never censored his words. He said “everything he felt, for good and bad and spoke with no filters. Even if we didn’t always understand him, you could never be mad at him because ultimately we all loved him and knew that this is how he was. He was embarrassed by the spotlight, out of modesty, but when he was teaching and guiding people he spoke like a great man.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Aviad Gad Cohen, 41, from Shlomit, was killed on October 7 while battling the Hamas attack on Moshav Pri Gan.\nWhen the rocket fire began that morning, Aviad was praying in a synagogue at an early-morning service in Shlomit, situated about 5 miles from the Gaza border and just a few hundred meters from the Egyptian border. Aviad headed home to his wife and five of his six children — the oldest was with friends in Sderot.\nAviad, a member of the local security team, helped calm down the kids inside their reinforced room before heading out to assess the situation. Unbeknownst to his wife, Aviad joined 10 other Shlomit residents and headed to the nearby Pri Gan community where Hamas gunmen were trying to invade.\nAviad and his friends and neighbors Bechor Swid, Reouven Chicheportiche and Oriel Bibi — as well as police officer Supt. Avi Zidon — were slain in the battle. No civilians in the town were killed.\nAs a member of his community’s local security team, Aviad was posthumously recognized as a fallen soldier with the rank of sergeant major in the reserves.\nHe was buried on October 10 in Berekhya. He is survived by his wife, Dana, their six children, Noa, Oriya, Maayan, Tohar, Dror and Uri, his parents, Oshra and Yitzhak, and his six siblings, Itamar, Eldad, Uriya, Daniel, Yotam and Noam.\nBorn in Berekhya, near Ashkelon, Aviad attended religious schools, including a yeshiva high school in Kfar Maimon. He attended the religious Yatir pre-military academy in the south Hebron Hills before enlisting in the IDF and serving in the Golani Brigade’s reconnaissance unit. He continued to do regular reserve duty for many years.\nAviad and Dana settled in Shlomit, a small town that was only established in 2011, and they were among the pioneers of the nascent community. Aviad worked for Mekorot, the water company, and was responsible for overseeing and inspecting the water supply in the western Negev region.\n“He was there, come rain or shine, always the first to help with any task or challenge, always at the front lines of action,” the company said in a statement. “He reflected the Israeli spirit in all its glory, the values of mutual responsibility, of solidarity and generosity to others and to the community.”\nMarking a year since he was killed, Aviad’s brother, Eldad, wrote on Facebook about all the things he missed: “Barbecues where something is missing, coffee that’s OK but not any better than that, five to six conversations a day (at least), plays we’d stage for the kids on the holidays that I’ll never do again without you.”\nEldad wrote of missing “not very funny jokes, the advice that would help me make decisions, the conversations in which you knew how to say the right words in order to calm things down, knowing that you had my back on every issue and topic. Knowing that I could call you and you’d drive an hour to me just to hang a shelf or some other nonsense.”\n“The glue of the family, the nights in Eshkol Park, the shooting range, knowing how to take everything easily and in proportion,” he continued. “The stupid impersonations, the dumb videos, the voice notes that would make me crack up with laughter, making beer together — it’s a million more things that will never be the same without you.”\nAviad’s wife, Dana, described to Ynet that when she told her children their father had been killed, “I sat them on the couch, looked them in the eyes and said that their father was a hero, he went to go help the residents of Pri Gan, he was killed and he won’t return. I explained to them that at this moment the heroism of their father passed on to them, entered into their DNA.”\nDana added, “I told them, ‘We’ll be heroes like Dad. We’ll fall, we’ll cry, we’ll get up, we’ll laugh and it will be hard but we’ll succeed.’ I promised them that our home will continue to be a home of joy and full of life because that was their father.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

They both updated their families that they were trying to head out but were stuck in traffic trying to leave the parking lot.\nThe connection with both of them was cut off around 8 a.m., the time their families believe both Nitzan and Olga were shot dead by Hamas terrorists. After several days of searching, his family was informed that his body had been identified.\nHe was buried in Netanya on October 10. He is survived by his parents, Yisca and Yaron, his brother Hadar and sister Zuf.\nBorn in Eilat, Nitzan was an active kid. He took judo classes, learned Capoeira and became an active scout member, according to an online eulogy. When he was 15, Nitzan, his mother and sister moved to Netanya.\nAlready in high school, Nitzan fell in love with cars and mechanics, even taking a course in Germany on vehicle diagnostics. He chose to pursue an academic “Atuda” track for his army service, studying for two years to become an auto engineer. He then enlisted in the IDF in 2015 as a technical combat soldier in the elite Duvdevan commando unit.\nAfter his release he continued to do regular reserve duty, and worked for 5 years in auto shops until — a little over a year before he was killed — Nitzan got his dream job: an automotive technician with Tesla. He excelled in the role, receiving a promotion and special training in Madrid just weeks before he was slain.\n“Half the world came to his funeral, from the counselors he had in scouts to friends from the army and from childhood, friends from work at Tesla, who got tattoos like Nitzan had in his memory, friends from Eilat and friends and family from Netanya,” his uncle, Yoram Tishbi, told a local news outlet.\n“Nitzan was dedicated to the army and always wanted to be in a super combat role,” he added. “This kid was like my own son, and I always saw how much he loved to help and to give of himself, he was just a kid with a good soul who always came to help, even without being asked. A boy who loved everyone and was loved by everyone.”\nHis mother, Yisca, told a local Netanya site that “Nitzan achieved all of his dreams in the span of a year, the biggest of which was to work at Tesla, and he accomplished that big time. At Tesla, they really loved him as a person and as a professional and they even gave him a promotion quickly.”\n“Nitzan loved this country, loved people as they were, he was a kid with morals, very Zionist, the salt of the earth,” she added. “Nitzan was a prankster with a heart of gold, always loved to make jokes and pranks… he was funny, a loyal friend, loved martial arts, was a boy of nature, breathed music and was a beloved scout leader.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Avi and the rest of the local security officers were told to get equipped and head out to a central meeting point.\nA group of dozens of Hamas gunmen on motorcycles arrived at the kibbutz gates and blew it open, invading the small community. Inside, they battled the outmanned and outgunned local security for several hours. Avi was shot and seriously wounded in the battle around 100 feet from his home. Many hours later, when the army arrived, he was flown to a hospital where he was declared dead.\nA member of the kibbutz’s local security team, he was posthumously recognized as a fallen soldier with the rank of chief warrant officer in the reserves. His fellow local security officer, Ofir Yaron, was also killed that day while trying to return to the kibbutz and join the defense. Two other local security officers were wounded, and everyone else in the kibbutz was saved.\nAvi’s funeral was held on October 15 in Beersheba and he was buried in Magen. He is survived by his wife, Varda, their three children, Peleg, Ella and Hagai, his mother, Latifah and his three siblings, Haviva, Rachel and Yoram.\nBorn in Ashkelon, he grew up an active member of the HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed Zionist youth group. During his mandatory military service, Avi served in the Nahal Brigade. After being released, he settled in Kibbutz Mashabei Sadeh, not far from Yeruham. There he met Varda, and the couple wed and settled in Magen, where she was raised.\nAvi studied agronomy at the Hebrew University’s Faculty of Agriculture, Food and Environment in Rehovot, working in the kibbutz and in later years as a teacher at the local school. More recently, he studied civil engineering and worked in construction. He danced in the “Aya Eshkol” dance troupe alongside Louis Har, who was kidnapped on October 7 and later rescued by IDF troops.\nHis niece, Michal Shechter, described Avi on Facebook as “the kibbutznik of the family, a dear and beloved man.”\n“A quiet man, funny, who always exuded calm and chill,” she added. “I always admired his actions and the path he built for himself… A man of manual labor, who built Grandma Latifah a copy of the sukkah that her family had in Iraq, who raised chickens when he was still a boy and went on to be an agronomist in the kibbutz — all with joy, generosity, faith in the journey and love.”\nAvi, she wrote, “was a man of actions and not words, and left us that legacy — to act without fear, to take care of our loved ones, calmly and peacefully, until we are called to fight.”\nHis cousin, Ilan Ron, said Avi was “modest and moral, with a smile that never left his face.”\nJust two weeks before he was killed, he said, “We had a cousins’ meetup that was arranged quickly and spontaneously, with warm, happy, loving vibes — which in hindsight was a farewell gathering from Avi.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Yakir Levi, Staff Sgt. Shalev Baranes and Staff Sgt. Itay Glisko — decided to head out and fight them face to face. All four of them were killed in the battle, but others inside the shelter were saved.\nIdan was buried in Ein Hamifratz on October 11. At his funeral, mourners arrived clad in red, the color of his favorite team, Hapoel Tel Aviv.\nHe is survived by his parents, Arnon and Eti, his siblings Shaked, Ziv and Yuval, and his girlfriend Yuval.\nBorn and raised in the kibbutz near Acre in the north, Idan was the third of the four children in the family, and was a natural-born leader from a young age, according to an online eulogy. Starting in 7th grade, he volunteered with an after-school program, building close connections with local kids and a love of informal education.\nWhen he was 14 he adopted a dog, Bomba, and they had a very close bond. He loved to cook, and was always trying out new experiments in the kitchen, but also loved going out to eat. His friends joked that Idan had three major loves — Hapoel Tel Aviv, his friends and the restaurant chain Humongous, known for its large portions. He would also write limericks, play soccer and ride horses, his family wrote in an online memorial.\nIn December 2021, Idan enlisted in the IDF, serving in the Golani Brigade, despite being exempt due to a severe bee allergy. Instead, Idan pursued a special treatment to build up his antibodies in order to allow him to enlist.\nWhile Idan had long dreamed of an extended overseas trip after being released from the army, a few weeks before he was killed he surprised his family when he said that instead he wanted to return to the kibbutz and pursue a career in education.\nIdan’s girlfriend, Yuval, wrote on Instagram to the “love of my life.”\n“How can it be that as each day passes I am learning to live without you, without hearing your voice, without waiting for you to come home on the weekends, to sleep with you all cuddled up — who will protect me if not you?” she wrote.\n“On the one hand, I’m so proud of you, my personal hero, now a hero for the whole country, but mostly for me, but on the other hand, why did you leave me here alone?” she added. “Where are you to tell me that everything is OK and it’ll all be over soon and we’ll sit and watch the game together… everyone always laughed at us that there wasn’t a moment when we weren’t holding hands, and now I walk in the street and just imagine that your hand is in mine.”\nHis mother, Eti, told the Davar news outlet that after having two daughters who were calm, Idan “was the total opposite. He pushed at every framework, he was constantly testing boundaries, testing us. An opinionated kid, you could never miss him. But he always went after his truth and sought justice,” she said, noting many calls from the school and tough conversations with teachers, “but we never gave up on him.”\nEti said that when she heard about Idan’s actions on October 7, “it was clear to us that if they decided to go out and fight, that Idan would be the first to storm ahead.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 142 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Master Sgt. Shai El Knafo, 30, a patrolman in the Israel Police’s Southern District, from Beersheba, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas attack on the Supernova music festival.\nShai was working as security for the festival that morning alongside his commander, Insp. Andrey Poshivay. When the attack began, they helped partygoers flee and fought back against the Hamas onslaught until they were both slain in the fight. Video footage from that morning shows Shai acting calmly to assist civilians and help people get to safety, assuring them that they would be OK.\nShai was buried on October 9 in Beersheba. He is survived by his wife, Sapir, their three children, Shilat, 9, Tahel, 6 and Lavi, 4, his parents, Ilana and Mordechai and his siblings Idan and Hila.\nBorn and raised in Beersheba, Shai was a devout fan of Hapoel Beersheba, attending as many games as he could. He even was a founding member of one of the team’s fan groups, The Camels.\nHe was also into video games, an online eulogy said, and he worked as a technician fixing phones, computers and video game systems before enlisting in the Israel Police in August 2022.\nShai’s younger sister, Hila, wrote on Instagram about the experience of being a “bereaved sister — it’s a longing that beats inside you, every second of the day. Longing for the crazy brother you were, and maybe also for who you could be today.”\n“Being a bereaved sister is to cry until it hurts, and after a few seconds to laugh until your stomach hurts, laughter that comes from the heart, when I remember the brother that you were,” she added. “Thank you for the best 15 years I could wish for myself, I’ll take care of everybody down here, and you make sure to watch over us from above.”\nShai’s mother, Ilana, wrote on social media marking a year since he was killed, “a year from the last time you called me Mom, a year that my heart skips a beat, a year that my soul is shattered, a year of longing every day, every hour, pain that only grows. A year of sleepless nights thinking endlessly about what you went through in your final moments, and how I didn’t succeed in protecting you.”\nAhead of Passover 2024, his wife, Sapir, wrote on social media to “my love, we miss you so much, all of us!”\n“With every holiday that approaches, your loss is felt more and more, with every step we take,” she added. “How can it be? How can we sit together around the table, on the most family-oriented holiday there is, the holiday that was the most yours, where we’re meant to be happy, without you?”\nAnd on Hanukkah 2024, Sapir wrote about how many people were memorializing Shai, “and I’m happy that people know you and your bravery,” even though “you were never someone who sought fame or heroism, but a modest guy who did everything quietly, put your family first. But there’s no doubt that you deserve it because you fought, you thought about all the people you could have saved, and you did.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

His body was not identified for a week after the attack.\nNadav was buried in Ashkelon on October 16. He is survived by his parents, Keren and Eitan, and his siblings Ofek, Dor and Yali.\nBorn in Ashkelon, Nadav — the third oldest in the family — was raised in the small nearby community of Beit Shikma, according to a state eulogy. He attended elementary school in Kibbutz Nitzanim and high school in Kibbutz Yad Mordechai, specializing in film studies.\nHe was very close with his family, including his grandparents, and loved being out in nature, especially fishing with his friends. Ahead of his enlistment in the IDF, Nadav intended to hike the Israel Trail, his loved ones said.\nA few months before he was killed, Nadav started a business making artwork out of wood and epoxy, setting up an Instagram page showcasing his work. One of the last things he made was a name plate for Sabine Taasa, the mother of his slain friend Or.\nIn his memory, Nadav’s brother, Dor, decided to carry on the business, launching N.T. Wood Life, writing that he had “the privilege of knowing and living alongside a pure soul like you.”\n“My beloved brother, Nadav, I knew from the beginning that I wanted to memorialize you, to continue your path in this world, I thought of the incredible business you started,” wrote Dor. “You chose to take something that was alive and died and you thought of bringing it back to life for others.”\nNadav’s mother, Keren, wrote in the Maariv newspaper ahead of Memorial Day that her son was “such a happy boy, always joyous with your huge smile on your face.”\n“My Nadavi, as your mother I know that you came to this word to teach us about the meaning of life, about respecting people, loving others and endless joy — those were the foundation stones you walked on,” wrote Keren. “Family for you was the highest value, you visited your grandparents every week and helped them regularly, they miss your visits so much.”\nNadav was a country boy at heart, “you were always connected to the land of Israel, the nature you loved with all your heart, and mostly the sea and the Kinneret. You loved to go fishing and to experience the land of Israel.” He was also “an artist who loved to create, whether it be jewelry or woodworking with epoxy, photography and more.”\n“My Nadav, your life was cut short so young, you weren’t even 18. You left behind so many dreams, including to serve in the IDF in the Oketz canine unit because of how much you loved dogs…. the longing for you is enormous and doesn’t end.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Yakir Levi, 21, a soldier in the Golani Brigade, from Moreshet, was killed battling the Hamas invasion of the Paga IDF outpost on October 7.\nThe small IDF post was beset by dozens of Hamas terrorists that day, and Yakir and his comrades set up position inside the on-base bomb shelter where they fought for hours to defend the camp.\nAround 11 a.m., the Hamas gunmen set the building on fire to force the soldiers out into the open. Yakir and three of his comrades — Staff Sgt. Idan Raz, Staff Sgt. Shalev Baranes and Staff Sgt. Itay Glisko — decided to go out to fight them face to face. All four were slain in the battle.\nOverall, 13 of the 26 soldiers stationed at the outpost that day were killed in the fighting.\nYakir was buried in Kiryat Ata on October 11. He is survived by his parents, Revital and Asaf, and his nine siblings, Avia, Shilo, Shani, Nofar, Nevo, Noya, Tahel, Yanai and Yinon.\nThe second-oldest out of the 10 children in the family, Yakir was born in Netanya, and moved to the small religious community of Moreshet in the Lower Galilee when he was in 3rd grade, according to a eulogy on the Maccabi Haifa website.\nHe was a big sports fan and loved watching the Maccabi Haifa team play, as well as following Maccabi Tel Aviv’s games. Yakir was described by his family and friends as a happy, modest, and faithful person who loved sports. He also enjoyed surfing, cooking, and hiking.\nYakir enlisted in the IDF in April 2022, first in the Multidomain Unit before moving to Golani, where he served as a squad commander in the 13th Battalion.\n“Yakir was the happiest boy I know,” said his father, Asaf. “He was always smiling, he was a modest and humble person and had great virtue in his love for others and for God.”\nA friend of Yakir’s, Binyamin, said Yakir was one of his best friends and was like a brother to him.\n“It was always nice to talk to him with his wonderful smile that I’ll never forget. Yakir would listen to me and know how to give good advice. He supported me and wished me success in everything I chose,” he said.\nHis cousin, Hadar Cohen, told a local radio station that “Yakir was really a special member of the family, I was very close to him because we’re the same age — we were like twins.”\nHadar said she last saw him a week before he was killed, “the whole family was together and we celebrated and were happy — and in a moment he was just gone… as time passes it doesn’t get any easier, we just feel his loss more and more.”\nFor Yakir, “the army was really important, it was his aspiration to give back to the country,” she said. “He gave everything for this country, he was a huge hero. Yakir spoke all the time about the army, even before he enlisted, he really wanted to have a meaningful service, but always modestly and quietly… even when things were hard, he never complained — I remember our conversations on tough days, he would always say that ‘overall, things were OK.'”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 145 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Orel Moshe, 21, a kashrut supervisor in the IDF’s 7th Armored Brigade, from Rechasim, was killed during the Hamas invasion of the Yiftah IDF outpost near Zikim on October 7.\nOrel was stationed on base that weekend, and when the attack began, he jumped to help evacuate and treat wounded soldiers. After bandaging up an injured comrade, Orel placed him into an evacuation vehicle, but at that moment, the terrorists opened fire on them and Orel was killed on the spot.\nHe was buried on October 11 in Kfar Hasidim. He is survived by his parents, Ilanit and Dayan, and his brothers, Eliad, Liav and Elroi.\nOrel was born and raised in an ultra-Orthodox family in the Haredi town of Rechasim near Haifa, according to an IDF eulogy, attending yeshiva in Migdal Haemek and later a pre-army academy in the Golan Heights before enlisting in the IDF in March 2021.\nHe loved nature and enjoyed hiking, especially on trails through rivers and streams. He was described by friends and family as responsible, dedicated, with a good sense of humor.\nOrel decided that he wanted to enlist in the IDF despite growing up in an ultra-Orthodox family, but wasn’t sure which path to take. Following advice from his father — who was also an IDF combat veteran — Orel spent his first two years of service as a combat soldier in the Golani Brigade.\nAfter that, he underwent a course for kashrut supervisors and was stationed to work at the Yiftah outpost near Zikim, with the 7th Armored Brigade, for the last few months of his service.\nHe was two weeks away from completing his service when he was killed.\nOrel’s friend from his service, Oded, wrote about him that he was a moral man whose family always came first to him.\n“I fell in love with you from the first moment, as did everyone else. I remember that we used to joke about which of the guys we’d be willing to introduce our sisters to, and everyone unanimously said you,” said Oded.\nAnother friend, Yaniv, wrote that he would never forget Yaniv’s “modesty, virtues and charity.”\nHis mother, Ilanit said that Orel “accepted everyone.”\n“He was loving and loved, always the joker in the group. You only needed a few minutes to fall in love with him.” She said his time in the army “was the best and most challenging possible. The guys there were incredible boys.”\nIlanit said Orel continued “to keep Shabbat and to put tefillin on every day. He was an incredible boy, to those around him, to his neighbors, his friends, and to everyone — he had such incredible manners and respect for his parents.”\nHis father, Dayan told Ynet that Orel had been unsure about whether to enlist to a unit for ultra-Orthodox soldiers or a mixed unit, and he had encouraged him to do the latter.\n“I later reaped the fruits,” he said. “Mothers would call or message me to say, ‘Orel’s dad — I want to tell you my son has become stronger in his faith, started keeping Shabbat, and done good things since he met Orel.’ These were things that warmed my heart.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 148 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

Peleg Salem, 30, a logistics officer in the 460th Brigade, was killed battling the Hamas invasion of Yakhini.\nThe morning of the attack, Peleg, a career IDF officer, was home in the small moshav of Yakhini, next to Sderot, with his wife and youngest daughter. When he heard that Hamas gunmen had arrived at the gate of his town, he grabbed his weapon and headed out to battle.\nFor around two hours Peleg fought back against the invading Hamas terrorists, killing a number of them, before he was shot and killed.\nHe was buried on October 10 in Rosh Haayin. He is survived by his wife, Yuval, four daughters, Noya, Tal-or, Tamar and Alma, his parents, Sigalit and Yitzhak, and his three siblings, Almog, Shunit and Shahaf.\nBorn in Rosh Ha’ayin, the third-oldest in the family, Peleg grew up in an observant family and attended religious schools, according to an IDF eulogy. He was a natural-born leader, his family said, and even as a kid would talk about and dream about joining the army.\nPeleg attended a pre-military boarding school for high school, part of the Or Etzion yeshiva in Merkaz Shapira. In July 2012 he enlisted in the IDF and was placed in the Givati Brigade, including fighting during the 2014 Gaza War. He signed on to stay in the army past his mandatory service period, and also completed an officers’ course.\nHe met and married Dganit, and the couple lived in Netanya, bringing Noya, Tal-or and Tamar into the world before divorcing.\nAfter becoming an officer, Peleg returned first to Givati before moving to serve as a brigade logistics officer with the 460th Brigade in the Armored Corp. That is where he met Yuval, a fellow officer, and the couple married in 2022 and settled in Yakhini, where their daughter Alma was born in 2023 — less than two months before Peleg was killed.\nHe was also a talented musician, playing the drums and guitar, would keep up regular workouts and in his limited free time loved to read. During his time in the army, he also received a degree in logistics from Sapir College in Sderot and also wrote and published a book aimed at sharpening the management and commanding skills of logistics officers and commanders.\nPeleg’s sister, Almog, wrote on Facebook on what was supposed to be his first wedding anniversary with Yuval, sharing a video of him walking to the huppa with his three daughters, “and there was nobody who wasn’t moved.”\n“God wanted you and took you to Him after you gave your soul for all of us and for the country that you loved and admired so much,” she added. “I wanted you to know that we haven’t forgotten and will never forget the beautiful family you built, our Yuvali, Alma, Noya, Tal-or and Tamar, who we will watch over forever — for you and for us. You left behind treasures that we are holding onto in order to stay strong and move forward… We know that was your life’s mission.”\nMarking a year since he was killed, Peleg’s wife, Yuval, wrote on Facebook that when they met, “you caused me to grow wings so I could go beyond myself and soar.”\n“It has taken a year of war to accept reality, to learn to live without you, without the home we built together full of love, without the dreams we dreamed together, but with a lot of love in my heart, and gratitude for the privilege of four years by your side that felt like an entire lifetime,” she wrote.\n“You made me the best version of myself, I thank you every day for the tools you left me for life, for being allowed to learn from you, for all the good you left me… the girls and our Alma are the treasure that contains all of you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Tomer Starosta, 23, from Holon, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHe attended the rave with his close friend from the army, Almog Meir Jan. When the rocket fire started, Tomer spoke to his mother and assured her that everything was OK. An hour later, he told her that he and Almog were going to head home via car. Shortly after 8:30 a.m., she called him again, and he said, “I can’t speak, I’m in the middle of a terrorist attack,” and that he was hiding in the bushes.\nHamas terrorists had fired RPGs and gunfire toward them as they were leaving the festival parking lot, blowing up the car next to them and damaging theirs. Tomer, Almog and two women they were giving a ride to — Hodaya and Tair David — fled the vehicle and went to hide in the bushes.\nTomer, Hodaya and Tair were all murdered. Almog was kidnapped to Gaza, and rescued by IDF troops in a daring midday operation on June 8, 2024. Only after Almog returned home, did he find out that Tomer had been slain that day.\nTomer’s family was not informed that he had been killed until nine days after his murder. He was buried in Holon on October 17. He is survived by his parents, Orly and Samuel, his two younger brothers, Orel, 11, and Itay, 10, and his stepfather, Itzik.\nHe was born and raised in Holon, attending local schools. After graduating, he enlisted in the IDF, serving as an Iron Dome operator in the Israeli Air Defense Command. Following his release, Tomer started working as a furniture assemblyman for IKEA, according to a municipal eulogy.\nHe was a caring big brother to his two younger siblings and a devoted grandson to his grandparents, making sure to visit often, his family said. He loved the sea and fishing, and loved music, singing all the time and even writing his own songs. He was a devoted fan of the Hapoel Tel Aviv soccer team.\nIn the past year of his life, he traveled extensively, visiting Thailand with his father, attending a bachelor party in Romania and vacationing in the Sinai with friends.\nHis father, Samuel, told Ynet that Tomer “was a wonderful kid, loving and talented. He loved sports, drawing, music, singing. He was a very multi-faceted kid, social, he had friends from around the country. Everything was ahead of him.”\nSamuel said Tomer had plans to study, get a degree, “but he said to me, ‘Dad, before that I want to live a little — to enjoy, to party, to travel, to see the world.’… he was my only child. He was my reason for living. Everything I did was for him and thinking of his future.”\nTomer’s mother, Orly, told Channel 12 news that he had been working for IKEA for the past year, and moved back to Holon six months before he was killed.\n“He wanted to start studies, he really loved to sing, he was a very happy boy,” she said. “He really loved festivals, this wasn’t his first festival. He loved to party and loved life. This is what comforts me — he really knew how to make the most of life.”\nOrly said at Tomer’s funeral, “There were thousands of people. From the army and friends. I saw there what a beloved guy he was. His friends said he was a kid with joy for life, with a huge heart. Whenever anybody needed anything he was the first to volunteer. We never saw him angry or moody, and he was always happy. Even when he’d see us downtrodden and unhappy — he’d always make sure to lift morale. He was a good boy, a handsome guy. That’s all we have left — memories.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Itay Svirsky, 38, from Kibbutz Be’eri, was kidnapped from his childhood home on October 7, 2023, and taken to the Gaza Strip by Hamas terrorists.\nHis parents, Orit and Rafi, were both murdered in Be’eri on October 7, his mother in front of his eyes.\nItay was killed in January 2024, the IDF said, assessing that while Hamas claimed he had been killed in an Israeli airstrike, they believe he was murdered by his captors days after Yossi Sharabi, also kidnapped by Be’eri, was killed as a result of an IDF strike.\nItay’s body was recovered by the IDF from Gaza in December 2024. He was buried in Kibbutz Be’eri, between the grave of his two parents, on December 6, 2024, almost a year after he was killed.\nHe is survived by his three siblings, Merav, Yonatan and Yuval. His 96-year-old grandmother, Aviva Sela, survived the Be’eri attack, while her caretaker, Grace Cabrera, was murdered.\nDuring some of his time in captivity, Itay was held with Noa Argamani, who was rescued by IDF troops in June 2024. Noa wrote on social media after his body was recovered, describing their “shared time together in captivity, in which we imagined a thousand scenarios how we’d return to Israel together, how we’d meet up for coffee after everything was over and laugh about everything.”\nNoa thanked Itay for “every one of our shared moments together. You were a friend, you were a big brother amid that dark place. You taught me so many things that I will take with me no matter where I go.”\nItay was born in Be’eri, the third of Orit and Rafi’s three children, entering the world just a few months after his parents settled in the kibbutz where his mother had grown up, the daughter of two of its founders, according to a kibbutz eulogy.\nHe was a sporty youth, playing mini basketball, tennis and soccer, and was a sworn fan of Maccabi Tel Aviv — attending as many games as he could. As an adult, he picked up Brazilian jiu-jitsu as well as Thai boxing and mixed martial arts (MMA), taking part in regular trainings. Itay was also musically talented, taking voice lessons and learning to play the guitar and the piano.\nAfter finishing high school, Itay enlisted in the IDF, serving in the Israeli Air Force’s air traffic control division. Following his release, Itay traveled to India, and upon his return, he bounced between Tel Aviv and Be’eri. In 2010 he began a degree in psychology and philosophy at Tel Aviv University, later switching to study economics and ultimately finishing with a generalized BA before continuing to a master’s in business management.\nIn later years he became interested in the “Satya” method of life coaching, taking a course to be qualified as a coach and starting to take on others as clients. He remained deeply connected to his family, a doting uncle to his nephews, a caring son and grandson, the heart and life of every family gathering and a regular visitor in Be’eri almost every weekend.\nHis aunt, Osnat Sela Weinberg, wrote in a eulogy that his whole time in captivity, “I imagined you totally alive, with us, returning, rehabilitating, making up the hours and days as uncle in the way only you know how to be… talking for hours to Meravi and Yonatan and Yuval… I saw you in a relationship, embraced and embracing with love… I saw your clinic prospering because who wouldn’t feel like anything was possible in your presence.”\n“I imagined you sitting with Grandma on the swing, offering her a cup of coffee as you always did with dedication, patience and endless generosity… sitting with her at sunset and telling her what’s in your heart,” Osnat added. “You were so attentive and sensitive and empathetic and respectful, with a heart of gold.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 151 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Sgt. First Class Vitaly Skipakevich, 21, a soldier in the Commando Brigade’s Egoz unit, from Ariel, was killed on October 7 while battling the Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Kissufim.\nThe morning of the attack, Vitaly and his comrades were stationed in Huwara in the West Bank, which had been the site of significant unrest in the prior weeks and months. They were sent down south to join the fighting there, and he called his parents to tell them to stay inside and lock their doors.\nHe was sent to Kibbutz Kissufim with his battalion and they entered in order to rescue residents and battle the Hamas gunmen inside. Inside one house, they were ambushed by a gunmen and Vitaly was seriously wounded but continued fighting. His family said he was brought elsewhere in the kibbutz for treatment and Vitaly demanded that others who seemed more hurt be treated first; he ultimately died of his wounds that evening in Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba.\nHe was buried on October 13 in Barkan. He is survived by his parents, Ruslan and Elena and his sister, Amalia.\nBorn in Russia, Vitaly and his family moved to Israel when he was a baby, settling in the West Bank settlement of Ariel. Growing up he always dreamed of a meaningful military service, and he attended the Naval Officers Boarding School in Acre for high school.\nAfter graduating, he went through the application process for the elite Shayetet 13 naval commando unit, and ultimately wasn’t accepted, something he took hard. But when he was selected for the Egoz reconnaissance unit he was thrilled, enlisting in December 2020, throwing himself into the role, training as a sharpshooter and taking part in many missions.\nHis family and friends set up an overlook point in his memory in Ariel in a spot where Vitaly loved to sit and think about things. With the end of his mandatory service coming up, his family said he had began to plan his future, lining up a trip to Thailand and Vietnam and promising that after his return he wanted to run a marathon.\nHis uncle, Vitaly Karant, told a Kan radio station that his nephew “was a kid with a lot of charm, an endless smile, a kid who should be right now on the beaches of Thailand, on a trip he’d been dreaming about for two years.”\nOn his way down south that day, his uncle said, Vitaly wrote a sort-of goodbye letter to his family and friends, envisioning in some way his fate: “My life was really good and I wouldn’t change anything in it, the path was always correct, even if others saw it as a mistake, I did everything my own way and enjoyed and learned from my mistakes,” he wrote, hours before he was killed. “I had a really unique life and I enjoyed every day in my life. Thank you to everyone and I hope you will remember me positively.”\nVitaly’s best friend, Shaked Ben Shlush, wrote on Instagram that it was hard to comprehend that “you’re not with me Vitaly, you’re not with me my brother. You’re somewhere up above, dying of laughter that I actually stood by the vow we took at age 18 when we enlisted,” that if one of us was killed in the line of duty, the other would show up to their funeral wearing fairy wings.\n“Yes, I did what you asked of me,” he wrote. “You’re so much more than a brother to me, you’re a part of me, a part of me has died and stopped functioning. We have a shared tattoo that will remind me of you always every time I look at it… You’re the family I chose for myself.”\nElena, his mother, wrote on Facebook about how they always celebrated the Russian festival of Novy God together as a family, “and even when Vitaly was in studies far from home he always convinced his teachers that he had to be home for this holiday… He always had presents under the tree — it didn’t matter what gift was waiting for him, he was always happy when he opened the package. He is missed so much by us! We love him so much in a way that cannot be described in words.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

His cremation ceremony was held at the Wat Banden cemetery on November 3. He is survived by his wife, Miew Nisa, his parents, Thongluan and Daosai, his older brothers Sonthaya and Chitprapa, and other relatives.\nHe and Miew had known each other for many years, growing up together, and had become a couple in 2014, when they were teenagers.\nHis older brother, Sonthaya, told a Thai news outlet that Jakkapong had been working for about 8 months in Israel when he was killed, picking fruit, and while he’d spoken to his family on Friday, they lost contact on Saturday.\n“I don’t know how to put into words what happened,” he said tearfully.\nJakkapong left for Israel in February 2023 to work and send money back to his family to help them build a home. He borrowed money to finance his travels, and his family said he had yet to pay it off when he was killed. He stayed in close touch with his family while he was away, they said, including regular Facetime videos with his young niece, who couldn’t understand what had happened to her uncle.\nJaonai Panpon, a friend of both Mon and Jakky, wrote on Facebook that “even though the two brothers are no longer here for everyone to see, they have brought happiness and laughter to everyone. And even though they no longer live in the real world, they have traveled to someone’s heart and continue to live in that person’s memories.”\nHis wife, Miew wrote on Facebook a month after he was killed that her husband “came to me in a dream — even if it was just a dream it was the warmest feeling.”\n“Thank you for coming to see me,” she wrote. “From now on, you don’t have to come anymore. I’m satisfied. I don’t have to worry about anything anymore. May you be born into a good place. I will always love and miss you. We were brought to each other to be together.

When they came under attack, they tried to escape, and Liav, Dvir and Sahar were all killed, while two of their friends managed to escape.\nHis family waited for any news of his fate for more than 10 days, until they were informed that his body had been identified. He was buried in Afula on October 18.\nLiav is survived by his parents, Michal and Eitan, and his brothers Or and Ido.\nBorn and raised in Nazareth Illit, now called Nof HaGalil, he attended local schools, excelling in his studies, according to a state eulogy. His family later moved and settled in Afula.\nHe was an active volunteer with the Krembo Wings organization for children with special needs, and Aharai, a group encouraging young leadership. Liav was also into physical fitness, including MMA (mixed martial arts) training and also enjoyed anime cartoons.\nAfter high school, Liav enlisted in the IDF and served in the Combat Engineering Corps. Following his release, he started studying for the psychometric exam to pursue higher education, and also worked first at a gas station and later as a security guard at a hotel in Eilat. He completed a year of pre-university studies and was slated to begin his degree in computer science at Ben Gurion University in Beersheba just after he was killed.\nHis cousin, Orpaz, told a local radio station that Liav “was supposed to celebrate his birthday a week after [he was killed]. He was a person you couldn’t forget, a huge smile, he was very sturdy and big and stable with a cynical and sly smile on his face. He was really a person you remember, moral and ethical, he volunteered with different organizations… and was also in an advanced class [in school], was about to start his studies.”\nLiav, she said, “wanted to fit everything in, to enjoy, to be with his friends, to be happy, he made sure to always spend Friday night dinners with his family… he was so significant to everyone who met him.”\nLiav’s mother, Michal, told a local news outlet that her son “dreamed of success. First to be a good and excellent student, to find a good job, to build himself and his life up and to take care of me and his brother. Liav was fully special. A good boy. An excellent student. You can’t say anything negative about him. A macho man, witty, with cynical and dark humor.”\nIt was important to her, she said, to memorialize him in many ways, to remember “who was Liav — a young man with good manners, values, dedication and respect for others.

After Daniel’s death, a video emerged of him telling his comrades in reserves duty about Amir and his legacy.\n“I could talk about him a lot, we grew up together in Ramat Hasharon, there are so many things I could say but it’s hard to define in words a connection to a friend who is like a brother,” Daniel told his soldiers. “One of the things I loved so much and I will take with me is that he was all-in with everything he did, he was in the army for 12 years, first in Givati, and I never understand how he could be all-in on the army and all-in at home as a dad, the same as he was with his hobbies.”\nDaniel said Amir was supposed to compete in an Iron Man a month after he was killed, “he really took everything from A to Z and succeeded in doing it,” including starting university studies in his 30s, being a husband and a father to two young daughters and even finding time to volunteer. “He’s given me a lot of strength in the past month and a half.”\nBorn and raised in Ramat Hasharon, Amir attended the Bnei Akiva Ra’anana Yeshiva before enlisting in the IDF in 2011, serving first in the Givati Brigade before being tapped to join the prestigious Sayeret Matkal reconnaissance unit.\nAfter 12 years serving in the army, Amir took a break to pursue a degree as part of his military career, studying for the year before his death at the Shalem College in Jerusalem. He and his wife Yona and their two young daughters had recently settled in a new home in Jerusalem.\nAmir was also an active athlete, taking part in triathlons and Iron Man competitions and finding time to train even amid his busy schedule.\nIn his memory, his cousin, Lital, started a project to widely share details about families sitting shiva for their loved ones to encourage people to visit.\n“We were very close in age, we miss him and are so pained and we wanted to do something in his memory — this is my little way of memorializing him so that he won’t be forgotten,” Lital told the Makor Rishon newspaper.\nAmir, she said, “was a modest guy, he’d never start a sentence with the word ‘I,’ he was less about talking and more about doing. This is what I learned from Amiri, to do things quietly and modestly, and I miss him so much.”\nMarking 11 months since he was killed, his mother, Haya, wrote on Facebook that she wished to “go back in time.”\n“To when? To any moment before October 7, and even to that morning when you flew out of the house. To go back to another hug and another kiss and just more you, my darling, Amiri.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Amin Akal al-Qoraan, 10, Jawad Ibrahim al-Qoraan, 11, Malek Ibrahim al-Qoraan, 16, and Mahmoud Diab al-Qoraan, 16, all cousins, were slain on October 7 when they were hit by a rocket while sitting together in their Bedouin village of Kukhleh.\nMalek and Jawad were brothers, and Amin and Mahmoud were their cousins. Malek and Jawad are survived by their parents, Ibrahim and Yusra, and their other siblings, while Amin is survived by his parents, Rana and Akal and his siblings, and Mahmoud is survived by his parents, Diab and Fariha and two sisters. Other family members were seriously wounded in the strike.\nThose living in unrecognized Bedouin villages in the south have long complained that they lack bomb shelters as well as the infrastructure for air raid sirens, leaving them uniquely vulnerable to rocket attacks. They say that the location is also considered an “open area” by the IDF, and many of the rockets are therefore not intercepted.\nResidents of many such villages have been engaged in a decades-long battle with the state, which says their neighborhoods are illegal and has been trying to convince them to move into planned, recognized townships with state infrastructure and shelters.\nNearby the al-Qoraan family in Kuhkleh, Mai Zuhair and her grandmother, Faizah Abu Sabeeh, were also killed in a rocket attack on October 7.\nSaid al-Qoraan, an uncle to the four boys, told the Kan public broadcaster, “I wish I could give my life to give them more time to live. I wish I could give up what I had left for you. My souls.”\n“It’s an unimaginable disaster, the ordinary human mind can’t comprehend such a thing,” added Said, a career IDF officer. “I had to rescue them from the rubble, from the inferno… they died in my arms.”\nHe said that after the tragedy, the IDF set up temporary shelters and sandbanks in the town, “but we already lost the most precious thing to us… I can’t look their mothers in the eye.”\nWhen they were buried, he said, “Every time they lowered one of them into the ground I wanted to go in, too. People stopped me. I wanted to join them.”\nSpeaking to Ynet in November 2023, Malek and Jawad’s father, Ibrahim, told Ynet that the word “tragedy” is too small to describe what happened.\n“Our children, a piece of our heart. We have no tears left,” he said. “We lost our children. At home. In their home. Which should be the safest place.”\nIbrahim, speaking to Ynet again in August 2024, said that things are “very hard. We’re still in October 7. Nothing has changed. We still have no protection. It doesn’t leave us, and when I start to talk about it it takes me back… brings up all the emotions again. It’s not something you can recover from.”\nHe added that “you can live with the loss and the bereavement but you can’t heal it. Our loss is very big.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Yohai Azulay, 28, from Holon, was murdered while trying to flee the Hamas attack on the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nYohai attended the party with a friend, and the two initially tried to escape in Yohai’s car when the invasion began but eventually decided to escape on foot as the road was jammed with traffic from everybody leaving at once. He last made contact with his family at 10:30 a.m., telling them that he was hiding.\nThe two friends ended up splitting up, and while his friend made it to safety, Yohai was missing for a week before his family was told his body had been recovered.\nHe was buried in Holon on October 15. He is survived by his parents, Ziva and Itzik, and his older sister Daniella Keren.\nAccording to a state eulogy, Yohai’s family chose words he wrote about himself for his gravestone: “I, Yohai Azulay, wanted to live a life full of spirituality, an endless quest to discover truth, and internal and external peacemaking from freedom and real balance that would lead me to a life filled with love.”\nHis mother, Ziva said that the words perfectly encapsulated Yohai’s “kind and forgiving heart and his wonderful personality.”\nBorn in Tel Aviv, Yohai lived with his family in the Jaffa section until 5th grade, when they moved to Holon, where he finished his schooling. He grew up in a traditionally religious family and spent much of his time devoted to exploring his roots and his connection to Judaism.\nHe served in the Kfir Brigade during his mandatory military service, and after his release, he toured around South America, a trip that saw him moving further away from religious observance. After his return, Yohai worked in sales, and soon met his girlfriend, Noa, and the pair soon became a couple who were planning a future together.\nHis sister, Daniella, wrote that Yohai liked writing, music, pizza, rock, pianos, comedy, reading, learning and philosophy.\n“In your short and full life, you believed in humanity’s kindness, you insisted on giving everyone the benefit of the doubt, and you managed to pull people to you from every direction like a human magnet,” she wrote.\n“You were curious and opinionated with a clear and solid opinion on every matter, but you still knew how to find what unites people. You know how to listen to everyone, and you listened and only after you’d understood the issue, did you say your part with grace, modesty, and calm that so characterized you.”\nYohai’s friend, Yarin Bar, wrote in an Instagram post that he had learned from him “how to be calmer, not worry about every little thing and go with the flow of life.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 157 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Cpt. Eily Adany, 21, a platoon commander in the Maglan commando unit, from Tel Mond, was killed on October 7 battling Hamas inside Kibbutz Kfar Aza.\nEily spent that weekend stationed at the Julis IDF base, east of Ashkelon. He and his team were awoken by the early morning rocket sirens, running for the bomb shelter. But Eilay quickly realized that this was no standard rocket fire, and ordered his soldiers to get their equipment ready and prepare to head into battle.\nThey headed down south, and along the way Eily turned and said to his soldiers: “The day we’ve been training for has arrived.” They arrived first at Sderot, hunting for terrorists holed up inside homes, before they were called to head to Kibbutz Kfar Aza.\nInside the kibbutz, they encountered heavy gunfire, and worked for hours to rescue families and battle the scores of Hamas gunmen. Around 2:30 p.m. he entered a home and was ambushed with gunfire from a Hamas terrorist who was holed up inside, and was slain. Two other members of his team were also killed in the battle in Kfar Aza — Staff Sgt. Amichay Vanino, who tried to tend to Eily’s wounds, and Sgt. Amit Guetta.\nEily was buried on October 12 in Tel Mond. He is survived by his parents, Orit and Rahamim (Rami), and his younger brother, Yanir.\nHe grew up in Tel Mond, near Netanya, known for his wide smile. He spent much of his time with Yanir, who was two years younger, according to a memorial website. He attended local schools and was active in the scout troop as first a participant and later a counselor. He also played volleyball with a local team for more than five years and was a devoted fan of the Hapoel Tel Aviv soccer team.\nThroughout high school, Eily was thinking about his eventual enlistment in the IDF, and working out and preparing physically and mentally for an intense combat role — which he received when he enlisted in March 2020, serving in the Maglan commando unit. He later underwent an officer’s course and in March 2023 was appointed to lead his own team in the elite unit.\n“Eily was our heart and soul,” his mother, Orit, told a local news outlet. “He wasn’t our son, he was more like our Dad. Always taking care of us. He was very brave, was super motivated and dedicated to protecting the country. There’s nobody who saw his kind eyes and didn’t fall in love with him.”\nOrit said Eily “always had a smile and endless generosity, a big heart. His teachers loved him, he always gave us so much pride and comfort. He did everything the best he could, including in the scouts and playing volleyball, even if it required a great effort and many sacrifices, just as he did in his role as platoon commander. He gave everything to his soldiers and always said he wanted to be worthy of the role.”\nHis younger brother, Yanir, told Ynet during his own IDF beret ceremony just a month after Eily was killed, that “I had a brother who was a hero, was incredible. I went to the commando unit because of him. I loved him so much, I admired him… Eily was a leader, a commanding and admired commander who was a role model and example for his soldiers and knew how to lead them through very complicated operations.”\nYanir said the pair “were very close and I miss him so much. His loss is so felt. I will always tell everyone about my brother the hero, who fought bravely against terrorists and was killed. I lost a brother who was an incredible fighter and commander and I will try to follow in his footsteps.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Syoma “Simon” Vigdergauz-Dovzhenko, 21, from Rishon Lezion, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while fleeing the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHe attended the rave with his girlfriend, Margarita (Rita) Gusak. When the rocket fire began, Rita told her family that they were planning on leaving via car, and that was the last they heard from her. The couple are believed to have made it to near Sderot before being killed.\nSimon was missing for several days before his body was identified, and Rita was not identified until another few days later.\nHe was buried in Rishon Lezion on October 11. He is survived by his parents, Lena and Sergey Dovzhenko.\nSimon was born in Artemovsk (now Bakhmut) in Ukraine, known to his parents as Semyon or Syoma. He was eager and inquisitive, learning to read at a young age, always gathering new information and a voracious reader, according to an online eulogy written by his parents.\nHe was a gifted student, winning prizes in academic competitions and also excelled in judo. In 2014, Simon and his family decided to move to Israel, a decision he prepared for by studying Hebrew. He finished high school at Revivim in his new home of Rishon Lezion, and took the traditional heritage trip to Poland with his classmates, visiting the sites of concentration camps.\nThat trip, his parents said, instilled in him a firm desire to serve in a combat role in the IDF, which he did by serving in the Yamas covert counter-terrorism unit in the Border Police. During that time, he also changed his name from Syoma to Simon and took his great-grandfather’s last name, Vigdergauz. Simon also enrolled in the Nativ military pathway to conversion, where he met Rita.\nThe couple were instantly besotted, his parents said, spending all their free time together, studying together, dancing together and hanging out in Rita’s art studio. When he was killed, Simon had only recently finished his army service, and like Rita was considering a career in medicine — following in the footsteps of his father, a doctor, and mother, a nurse.\n“Syoma accepted the world and those around him with love and kindness; from his early childhood Syoma was kind and non-confrontational, sociable and peace-loving, his main ‘tool’ was a dialogue,” his parents wrote. “Syoma was very passionate and thorough, he was not satisfied with facts, he needed causes and effects… Syomochka had an amazing sense of humor, inspiring optimism even in a hopeless situation.”\nThey wrote that from the moment Rita and Simon met, “these two angels became inseparable, they knew everything about each other, they breathed each other, as if their destinies were connected in heaven… Simon and Margarita were inspired by each other, tenderly took care of each other — and passed together, leaving behind bright memories.”\nEmuna, who directed the Nativ course, wrote online that she “got to see Rita and Simon fall in love before of my eyes, pure and exciting love. We would look at their loving glances, one at the other, it was impossible to miss it, even in the cluttered-up schedule of the entire course… I am comforted by one thing — that I am sure that on October 7 at 6 a.m. you were so happy together!”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Command Sgt. Maj. Sivan Yenin, 49, a community police officer for the Bedouin community, at the Aroer station, from Arad, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas attack on the Supernova music festival.\nSivan was one of the officers at the rave early that morning working to secure the event. With the start of the rocket fire, he messaged his loved ones that he was helping partygoers get to safety after the event was shut down.\nLater that morning, Sivan texted that there was a terrorist invasion and people were wounded, writing at 7:48 a.m. that “it’s a colossal mess.” That was the last anyone heard from him. After a few days, his police cruiser was found riddled with bullets, but there was still no sign of Sivan.\nHis fate was unknown for 10 days following the attack, until his body was identified. He was buried in Arad on October 17.\nHe is survived by his three children, Peleg, Afik and Nahal, his parents, Baruch and Tzafra, his siblings Bar, Ofek and Gani, and his girlfriend, Racheli. His first grandchild, Ori Simcha, was born on the 30th day following his funeral.\nBorn in Kibbutz Gesher in the north, near Tiberias, Sivan grew up with his three siblings, and loved to work with his hands and build with Lego and was a big fan of Star Wars. At 16 he decided to leave school and work in agriculture in the kibbutz until he enlisted in the IDF, serving in the Armored Corps.\nAfter his release, Sivan worked in a number of jobs, including as a lifeguard and at a dairy farm, until in 2003, at age 30, he enlisted in the Israel Police. He got married and had three children, settling in Arad in the south, before divorcing.\nDespite the great distance from Arad to Kibbutz Gesher, his parents said Sivan visited regularly, often bringing the kids, and the family managed to maintain a strong bond, with Sivan also doting on his nieces and nephews. He traveled with his children around the world, including Thailand and the Sinai, sharing with them his love of scuba diving and always taking many photos of his travels.\nSivan’s loved ones said he was extremely excited for the birth of his first grandchild, and had been picking up extra overtime shifts in order to buy all sorts of gear and accessories for the new baby — including taking the job working at Supernova.\nHis girlfriend, Racheli, told a local radio station that “Sivan was a police officer in his soul. He essentially became a cop because he was exposed to injustice when he was a kid and he decided that he wouldn’t let things like that happen anymore. He was a family man, he would do everything for his kids, he was always looking for ways to take care of them. He was about to be a grandfather and he was looking forward to it so much and working to offer more financial support.”\nHis son, Afik, wrote on Instagram a year after he was killed that his father “was always like my best friend, I told you everything and I never held back anything from you. You always said that ‘there is nothing but fear itself,’ and now without you there are empty periods full of fear.”\n“Dad, sometimes it feels like you just went on another trip abroad that you always wanted to the Maldives or something, and that soon you’ll be back with lots of experiences and photos of everything you did,” Afik added. “But this time you went on a different kind of trip, one you’re not coming back from.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 160 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

When the rocket fire began, they both left via car, and were heading to the nearby Moshav Mivtahim to hole up with a family friend who invited them over to seek shelter.\nAt 7:13 a.m., they got to the junction just outside Mivtahim and the neighboring Yesha and they were shot dead there by Hamas terrorists who were lying in wait along the highway. After two days, their car was located and their bodies were removed and identified.\nIdo was buried in Tel Aviv on October 10. He is survived by his parents, Osnat and Eran, his older brother, Eden, and his girlfriend, Bar.\nBorn and raised in Ramat Gan, he attended local schools, including the well-known Blich High School. He was very close to his older brother, Eden, and he met his girlfriend Bar when they were just 15, spending 8 years of their lives together up until he was killed. Ido loved to play soccer and was also a devoted fan of the Maccabi Tel Aviv team, according to a state eulogy.\nAfter graduating high school, Ido enlisted in the military, serving for three years in the Navy aboard the INS Lahav corvette warship. After his release, he traveled to the Sinai, Europe, the US and Mexico, before returning to Israel and started to work in security while he planned out his future.\nHis older brother, Eden, wrote on Instagram about how “when I was little I asked Mom and Dad to bring me a brother as a present and then you were born.”\n“I would tell people that Ido is my little brother but he’s not really little, he’s taller than me, and you would look at me from above with appreciative eyes and I would feel like the little one next to you,” he added. “You have the best, most beautiful and pure heart in the world… You couldn’t even tell the smallest lie, you always told us exactly how things were and only the truth.”\nEden said that Ido was “loved like crazy everywhere you went, and your friends are a group of mensches and they are all my little brothers now.”\nSpeaking on Channel 13 news, his mother, Osnat, said Ido “was a child of love, a child of generosity, who was always ready to help, always first to go out and help and volunteer. The boy went to a festival of peace. He went to set up an exhibition of drawings for his friend [ahead of the festival], and he never came back from a festival of peace. This is a kid who was a deputy in the Navy on a missile boat, he took part in operations in Israel and abroad, and he didn’t come back from a festival.”\nHis girlfriend, Bar Lanyado, wrote on Instagram thanking Ido “for you, for eight years during which we grew together and learned together what life was.”\n“What didn’t we go through together — high school, the army, the big trip abroad. This relationship wasn’t supposed to end this way, we were supposed to continue together forever, and we always knew it,” she added. “But this relationship didn’t really end, my heart will always be yours and you will always be a huge part of it… I was privileged to have the best thing in the world.

    "story": "Elizaveta “Lilia” Kostitsina, 78, from Ofakim, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in her home in the city on October 7.\nShortly after the start of the rocket fire, she messaged her daughter that she heard tons of booms and wasn’t sure what was going on. Not long afterward, the two of them spoke, and Lilia said she felt bad for the neighbors who had to take their kids into the stairwell during ever siren, and was going to invite them into her apartment, where she had a room without any windows.\nLilia opened her front door and was shot dead by terrorists who had invaded the apartment building. Her neighbor, Emma Poliakov, was also slain in the attack.\nDespite knowing that she had been killed, Lilia’s family had to wait more than a week for her body to be identified and for them to be given official notice of her death.\nShe was buried on October 16 in Ofakim. She is survived by her two children, Margarita (Rita) and Sergey (Shlomi) and 10 grandchildren.\nLilia was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, to Freida and Solomon, a couple of months after the end of World War II, according to a state eulogy. She grew up in the city alongside her older brother, Naum, to parents who had fled pogroms in Belarus.\nAs a child she enjoyed literature and theater, but chose a more realistic and secure career, studying engineering. She had two children and worked in a factory that made parts for Katyusha rockets. Her children both moved to Israel and after she retired, Lilia followed them, arriving in 2000, living first in Jerusalem, then Modiin before settling in Ofakim, near her son, who became a rabbi. In Ofakim, she enjoyed caring for her garden, according to a municipal eulogy.\nIn the summer of 2023, she had heart surgery and was slowly recovering, returning to her walks around the neighborhood and getting back into her usual routine of helping out all those around her, including friends, neighbors, new Russian-speaking immigrants, family and her 10 beloved grandchildren.\n“She really loved Ofakim, she loved her garden and every day until her last day she would go out to the garden and take care of it,” her daughter, Rita, told Maariv. “My mother was always taking care of those around her, she’d always ask me for help to solve their problems with various governmental bodies,” including medical providers and insurance agents.\nShe was looking forward to an upcoming visit from her nephew in Germany, “she’d already gone shopping, arranged day trips and they had all their plans set for his arrival… My mother loved life very much and had many more years to live.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Yonatan “Yoni” Golan, 21, a tank commander in the 7th Armored Brigade, from Yehud, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the Nahal Oz IDF outpost.\nHe was stationed at Nahal Oz that Saturday morning, and was awoken by the rocket fire which launched the attack. Not long after, his battalion commander called to alert him of the Hamas invasion, telling him to “run to the tanks.”\nYoni and his comrades jumped into action, and for several hours used the tank to battle the cross-border attack in the areas of Nahal Oz and Nirim. At a certain point, they were called back to the Nahal Oz army post in order to help counter the Hamas invasion on the hard-hit base.\nThere the tank was hit by RPG fire and the tank crew jumped out to race for the on-site bomb shelter, with Yoni protecting them. His comrade Sgt. Or Avital was killed, and when Yoni went to retrieve his body, he was also shot and killed.\nHe was buried on October 12 in Yehud. He is survived by his father, Ran, stepmother, Adi, and his siblings Maya, Dor, Lihi and his identical twin brother Yotam. Yoni’s mother, Hila, died when he and Yotam were 4.\nBorn in the Neve Monosson neighborhood of Yehud outside Tel Aviv, Yoni lived until age 5 on Air Force bases, growing up with a father who was a military pilot. Afterward, he grew up in Yehud, where he was active in the local scout troop, was a talented basketball player and was also very musical, and could be found playing the guitar during most of his spare time\nAfter finishing high school, Yoni decided to attend the Minsharim Kalu pre-army academy in Kibbutz Ma’agan Michael — where he met his close friend, Staff Sgt. Ido Harush, who was killed while fighting Hamas in the Yiftah IDF outpost on October 7.\nIn August 2021 he enlisted in the IDF, and while he had explored joining the Air Force, he decided to go to the Armored Corps, believing that it was where he was needed most. He rose through the ranks until he became a tank commander.\nHis father, Ran, told the Kan public broadcaster that Yoni “always took care of those around him, whether it was in basketball, or in the scouts or later as a tank commander, he was always worried about those nearby, also those who were invisible or who were having a hard time.”\nAnd on that dark Saturday, Ran said, “Yoni did what Yoni knew how to do — he came back to save his soldiers, to rescue them from the tank, he protected his deputy company commander, and his gunner so they could get to safety. I have no doubt that he wasn’t afraid for a moment. He did what he knew and always wanted to do — to protect his friends.”\nHe loved astronomy as a kid, his father said, and “he was always enchanted by the stars… we both really wanted to reach the stars. He’s in the stars now. He is our star.”\nYoni’s twin brother, Yotam, told an IDF site news article that the pair were so identical as kids, they had to always be dressed in different colors: “I was dressed in warm colors, and Yoni in cool colors. And that really matched our personalities, I was hot-headed and restless, while Yoni was calm and carefree.”\nYotam said the pair were “as identical as you could be. When you’re a kid, you think it’s shocking, and when you grow up there’s a moment where it changes. When you understand that it’s the best thing that happened to you.” For them, he said, it was when they stopped sharing a bedroom — “all we had wanted was to separate, and suddenly we wanted to go back together.”\nUntil they went to separate pre-military academies after high school, he said, the longest they’d ever been apart was a week. When he was informed that Yoni had been killed, Yotam said he “fell to the ground and fell apart. It’s the worst feeling I’ve ever had in life, I don’t think I’ll ever feel anything that comes close to it.”\nAt his funeral, “When they lowered his coffin into the ground, I felt like half of me was going with it… To lose a twin is to lose yourself. Every breath I took, every thought I had, was together with him.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 163 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Yehoshua Hatav, 66, from Ashkelon, was killed after he was hit by a rocket fired from Gaza at the city on October 7. He died of his wounds four days later, on October 11, 2023.\nHis family said Yehoshua debated attending synagogue that morning amid the rocket fire, but decided to do so since the building had a bomb shelter. On the way home from prayers he was severely wounded by a rocket impact. He was hospitalized in intensive care at the Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon for three days before succumbing to his wounds.\nYehoshua was buried in Ashkelon on October 11. He is survived by his wife, Rachel, their twin daughters, Adi and Revital, several grandchildren — including two more sets of twins — and his five siblings, Uziel, Yaakov, Yehuda, Yair and Yael.\nBorn in Kfar Yehoshua in the Jezreel Valley, Yehoshua lived there for a number of years until his family moved to Moshav Berechya near Ashkelon, according to a state eulogy, attending religious schools growing up.\nIn 1974 he enlisted in the IDF, serving on the Tel Nof airbase as a purchasing manager. He pursued a military career, remaining in the army until his retirement after almost 30 years, in 2003. After he left the army, Yehoshua managed a technical sales center for a tool repair company and later worked as a machine technician.\nHe and Rachel married in 1986 and settled in Ashkelon, where they raised their twin daughters. Over the years he welcomed his seven grandchildren — including two born less than two weeks before he was killed — doting on them and adapting to the role of grandfather with ease.\nIn a post marking Memorial Day, his daughter, Adi, wrote about “seven months during which the memory doesn’t heal.”\n“I always think what you would have said to me, what advice you would have given me, what creative solution you would have found for my problem,” she added. “For seven months I am asking you and there’s no answer, Dad. I feel your loss so strongly, we need you so much by our side… thank you Dad for the privilege of being your daughter. Thank you for being the perfect grandfather for our children.”\nHis other daughter, Revital, wrote on Facebook on what would have been his 67th birthday, saying that she was “sure that any moment you’ll walk in the door with a bunch of bags from the supermarket and ask me if you should put a can of cola in the freezer so it will be cold in time for our dinner together.”\nShe still imagines, she wrote, “You asking me what’s going on with the children and giving me a several-minute speech about how I shouldn’t get angry at them and I’m lucky to have good kids… and at the end of the conversation always noting that when we come, the girls should go to your drawer because you bought them the tasty treats they love.”\nAfter his death, she said, they opened the notes app on his phone, “and saw a list of tasks for every day, so you’d never miss anything,” planning for Shabbat already on Sunday, she wrote. “It’s hard to describe a man like you in words. I wish to myself that I can be to my kids just a drop of what you were for me.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "First Sgt. Elior Ifrah, 34, a police detective in the Negev district, from Ofakim, was killed while battling the Hamas attack on the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nElior was working as a police officer helping to secure the festival that morning. With the start of the rocket attacks, he called his wife at home and told her that things were crazy and he was trying to help everyone leave. Shortly afterward, he called to warn her of the terrorist invasion, telling her to lock the doors and close the shutters at home in Ofakim.\nAt the site of the rave, Elior worked to help partygoers flee and hide, protecting them with his body until his very last bullets. He was shot and killed while calling on others to flee, alongside his friend and colleague First Sgt. Sharon Rahmani.\nHe was buried in Beersheba on October 10. He is survived by his wife, Hen, their three children, Lavi, 7, Harel, 5, and Ilay, who was born 7 months after his father was killed. Elior is also survived by his parents, Rita and Zion, and his brothers Shlomi and Avihai.\nBorn and raised in Beersheba, Elior was always good with his hands, including focusing on art during school, always being handy around the house and later even helping to build his own home. He completed his IDF service in the Border Police, staying on past the mandatory period and moving to serve in the Gaza Division, according to an Ofakim municipal eulogy.\nIn 2015, Elior enlisted in the Israel Police, serving as a detective in the Negev District’s investigative and intelligence unit. Loved ones described him as dedicated to the job, always aspiring to learn and develop further in the role and bring new ideas and technological advances to the unit.\nHe was a doting father to Lavi and Harel, and he was thrilled about the newest baby on the way — which the couple had only found out about not long before Elior was killed.\nHis father-in-law, Vili, wrote on Instagram to “Elior, my beloved son-in-law with the permanent smile and kind heart. You always helped me, always volunteered to assist others in everything. You knew it all. I will miss you so much. I promise to watch over my Hen and the sweet grandchildren you left us.”\nHis wife, Hen, told a local news site that Elior “always said that nothing was impossible. You want it? Work for it. When he took a project upon himself he would always carry it out in the best way, he was a perfectionist with hands of gold, he researched and learned out of curiosity and ambition to be the best. The salt of the earth.”\nIn their own home in Ofakim, which they moved to five years before Elior was killed, he played a role from start to finish, she said, “the plaster to the a/c units, the pergola, carpentry and the closets. We dreamed together and we got to achieve those dreams… Elior always said that anyone can achieve the dreams in their heart with their own hands.”\n“He had such high levels of generosity, he always helped others with patience and calm,” she added, “with a smile on his face and crazy charisma that bowled people over. A funny guy. His friends say that even after his death he continues to help them in moving ways.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

At the start of the rocket fire, they all fled the site of the rave and sought safety in a public bomb shelter.\nWhen they heard the Hamas gunmen approaching, Sela and Matan decided to create a diversion, sprinting out of the shelter. The terrorists opened fire, and Matan was killed while Sela was wounded but managed to ultimately escape and survive. Ilay and Addir then also tried to fight back against the terrorists and were ultimately slain.\nMatan was buried in Even Yehuda on October 11. He is survived by his parents, Miri and Erez, and his three siblings, Maayan, Dana and Nir.\nHe and Ilay and Addir grew up together in Even Yehuda and were active in their local scout troup. The three were all also known as avid surfers. They were buried side-by-side under a surfboard bearing their names.\nMatan’s friend Guy Raz wrote on Instagram that he was “a pure person who was wholly full of joy and love. His love for the sea was something inseparable from him. He knew how to make everyone feel like they were the most loved in the world — this was his special trait. His incredible smile never left his face even months. He was an incredible friend and an even better person, knew how to help and listen to everyone.”\nHis sister-in-law, Natali, wrote on Facebook to “our Matani, the heart of everyone. I can’t believe they took you from us. Your whole life was still ahead of you. You took advantage of every minute and enjoyed life the way only you knew how. Your captivating smile will remain in our hearts forever.”\nAt a November 2023 memorial for the three friends, 1,500 people came to Netanya’s Poleg beach to surf together in their honor.\nAt the event, Miri, Matan’s mother, told Ynet that the three of them “were good kids and students, excellent combat soldiers. But more than that they were friends. They were big and happy kids who swallowed up what life had to offer them. They had big aspirations, they were just ahead of starting their studies.”\nMiri said the three of them were “the firm foundations of this country, of this generation. Like a blazing sun spreading the light of life and joy. Like the roiling waters that surge and the sea and its waves that were a home to them.”\n“Each of them was a whole world,” she added. “When they were alive, they touched the worlds of others, and in their deaths they illuminated the important things for us… to be good, to love, to offer a hand to others, to be part of the lives of others, to travel to new places, to be happy, to listen to music, just as they did.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 166 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Adam Agmon, 21, a soldier in the Paratrooper’s Brigade, from Kamon in the Galilee, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Kissufim.\nThe morning of the attack, Adam and his comrades were in the middle of a squad commander’s course with the Bismalach Brigade at a base next Yeruham, but were immediately called into action. They went first to Kibbutz Nirim and later nearby the site of the Supernova festival in Re’im before being sent to battle Hamas gunmen in Kissufim.\nThroughout the day he updated his father about their movements, telling him via WhatsApp that they “killed two terrorists at the Re’im Junction.” Arriving at Kissufim, Adam and his comrades — all Paratroopers in the midst of the same course — worked to rescue the besieged residents and slay the Hamas gunmen still inside the kibbutz.\nAdam and Saar Margolis, a member of Kissufim’s local security team, were killed Saturday afternoon by gunfire while trying to rescue a family barricaded inside their home overrun by Hamas terrorists. Alongside him, his comrades Sgt. Omri Peretz, Sgt. Matan Malka, Sgt. Bar Yankilov, Sgt. Lavi Buchnik and Sgt. Regev Amar were also slain in Kissufim.\nAdam was buried on October 12 in the Misgav cemetery near Karmiel. He is survived by his parents, Shlomit and Oren, and older brother Yahel. A month after he was slain, Adam’s step-brother-in-law, Master Sgt. (res.) Dov Moshe (Dubi) Kogan, was killed fighting in Gaza.\nBorn in New Zealand to Israeli parents, Adam and his family moved back to Israel when he was young, and he grew up in the small town of Kamon in the Lower Galilee.\nA devoted sports nut, Adam and his brother and father were fans of the New Zealand national rugby team All Blacks — even sharing the same tattoo of the team’s logo — as well as of the Hapoel Haifa soccer team. He himself played as a youth for the Kiryat Shmona soccer team and had a deep love for the sport.\nBefore enlisting in the IDF, Adam complete a year of national service working with youth at a therapeutic boarding school in Haifa. His family said that after his release from the army, he had a job lined up at the Hapoel Tel Aviv nonprofit that deals with at-risk youth.\nHis older brother, Yahel, wrote on Instagram on what would have been Adam’s 22nd birthday, noting that he would “never reach the age where you were supposed to be released from the army.”\n“You were waiting for it so much, we talked and planned about the when and the where and the why and how excited you were to explore the world and yourself,” he wrote.\nYahel said he now felt a responsibility to explore the world for both of them, as “you’re not physically here to see, but the light that you are and the joy that you are — I feel inside me so strongly.” Alongside the pain and the loss, he said, he feels a sense of luck,”that I had the best brother in the world.”\nAdam’s father, Oren, told Haaretz that while he was in the army, they had a deal that Adam would text him every single day to let him know he was alive. In the year since he was killed, Oren has sent his son a message every single day.\n“I’m an all-in father,” he said. “Where my children are, that’s where I am. Attached to them. There for them. Fighting all their battles. Because neither Yahel nor Adam were exactly at the top of their class, to put it mildly… they both played soccer. So I never missed a game, except once. I’m talking to you about 20 years. Being there for them 24/7.”\nOren said if he ever heard that “at 4 in the morning they’re at some party. ‘Dad, I have a headache, come and pick me up’ – I go get them. Once, on Yom Kippur, I went out in the middle of the night to get them from some forest near Lake Kinneret, because they didn’t feel well.”\nAdam’s father said his son “decided to sacrifice himself. Knowingly. In order to save the people of Kissufim… Adam is not a classic leader,” he said. “Yet on that day he displayed some sort of pure leadership ability.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

He put on his vest and helmet and headed out the door to meet up with Lior Ben Yaakov, the only other member of the team present in the town that day.\nGil, Lior and an off-duty soldier from Yesha, Staff Sgt. Itay Nachmias, headed to the entrance of the town and met up with the local security team from the neighboring Mitvahim moshav, and began to battle the Hamas gunmen who were attempted to attack the towns. There Gil, Lior and Itay were slain alongside Tal Maman and Dan Asulin, but succeeded in preventing the terrorists from entering the towns.\nA member of his community’s local security team, Gil was posthumously recognized as a fallen solder with the rank of sergeant major in the reserves.

He is survived by his wife, Racheli, their three children, Nitzan, Raz and Omer, his parents, Aliza and Eli, and his four siblings, Avi, Benny, Orit and Michal.\n“As the head of the local security team for 30 years, I feel some sort of guilt that Gili followed in my footsteps,” his father, Eli, told the Kan public broadcaster. “My son is really a hero, a hero who saved this whole area and all of our families including his children.”\nHis son, Omer, told Channel 12 news that “anyone who knows him — that’s my dad, the first to jump into action, the first to come and defend and and not give up.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Eviatar Ochayon Abukasis, 22, an ambulance driver in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion, from Jerusalem, was killed on October 7 while battling the Hamas invasion of the Kissufim IDF outpost.\nWith the start of the rocket fire from Gaza, Eviatar and the others on base ran to the bomb shelter. When they received word that there was a Hamas invasion of the outpost, they ran to get their weapons and returned to the shelter. Eviatar stationed himself at one entrance to the shelter, and he and the soldiers inside fought valiantly against the Hamas gunmen.\nEviatar was killed when a Hamas terrorist threw an explosive device inside the shelter, slain there along with his commander, Maj. Raz Peretz and five other soldiers: Staff Sgt. Yogev Aharon, Staff Sgt. Or Asto, Staff Sgt. Brando Flores Garcia, Staff Sgt. Teshager Taka and Sgt. Uriel Segal.\nOctober 7, 2023, was supposed to be Eviatar’s final day in active duty during his mandatory IDF service.\nHe was buried on October 11 on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. He is survived by his parents, Yaakov and Yasmin, and his six younger siblings, Orel, Miryam, Rut, Israel, Noam and Tehilla.\nThe oldest of 7, Eviatar grew up in Jerusalem, attending Chabad schools in the Gilo neighborhood as the child of parents who had found religion later in life, and later a yeshiva in Safed, according to an IDF eulogy. He was an artistic child, drawing and painting, including during his time in yeshiva, his family said.\nHe later left the yeshiva and moved to a religious boarding school in the settlement of Ovnat next to the Dead Sea, where he continued his artistic endeavors, including sculpting, woodworks and ceramics.\nEviatar attended the Derech Eretz pre-military academy in the Negev, and in March 2021 he enlisted in the IDF, serving in the Golani Brigade. He underwent a number of training courses, and in his final job worked as an ambulance driver stationed at the Kissufim outpost.\nHis sister, Miryam, wrote on Instagram, “My big brother, the kid I admire and appreciate, the most talented, the most beautiful, the most brave and the most heroic.”\n“You fought and worked hard even when it wasn’t easy and you never gave up on yourself,” she wrote. “A hero in life and a hero in death.”\nShe recalled his “big blue eyes, gorgeous curly hair — or as we called it, a cauliflower on your head — a little reddish beard that you finally listened to us and grew, almost 6’3″ tall… and as your sister I remember you in every period a little differently, but your heart, your enormous heart that needed a body as big as yours to contain, remained the same heart, one of the things that most symbolized you.”\nEviatar’s mother, Yasmin, told Army Radio that her son was “a magical boy, very special… a gentle soul, very, very sensitive.”\nYasmin said that no matter his religious path, “he continued with his values, he was more righteous than 100 righteous men. He had a very unique sensitivity to those around him, that was Eviatar… He had a lot of life wisdom.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 169 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

The bus got a flat tire and stopped in Sderot next to a bus stop that doubled as a bomb shelter.\nThe group were standing outside the bus stop when the rocket fire began, and while the electronic door of the shelter was supposed to automatically open during a siren, it remained locked and the tripgoers were unable to enter. Moments later, a pickup truck of Hamas terrorists drove by and opened fire on the group, killing every one of them — only the bus driver survived.\nImages of the brutal bus stop massacre were among the first to circulate in Israel and around the world early that morning. Lilia was slain alongside the rest of the passengers, including Igor Kurtser, Berta Shamayev and Michal Zarbailov.\nLilia was buried in Ofakim on October 12. She is survived by her three children, Michael, Sharon and Eden, whom she raised as a single mom.\nAccording to an Ofakim municipal eulogy, Lilia loved animals and specifically dogs, and had four Pekingese dogs of her own, named Dudi, Klufa, Chula and Lulik, that she showered with love. Lilia liked to travel and already had her next trip planned for two days after the attack — this time to Russia.\nHer daughter, Eden, told a Russian-language Israeli news site, “It’s incredibly hard. My mother was a single mother, and now I’m alone.”\nEden said that for days she and her siblings did not officially know what had happened to her mother, but they had seen photos of the bus stop massacre and thought she might be among them. Receiving the official news after five days “was a huge shock and a lot of pain.”\n“There is not a day when I do not think about my mother,” she said. “My body hurts, and so does my soul. I try to be strong because I know she would be proud of me… my mother did not choose to be killed by terrorists, she just wanted to relax at the sea.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Hanan and Ofer turned around and stopped along the way to seek safety in a roadside bomb shelter not far from Kibbutz Re’im.\nThere they were both slain when Hamas terrorists attacked those huddled inside with gunfire and grenades. After three days of searching, Ofer’s family was informed that his body had been found and identified.\nHe was buried on October 10 in Beit Shemesh. He is survived by his daughter Mor, 6, son Lavi Yehuda, 4, his parents, Sarah and Motti, and his siblings, Maya and Yoni.\nBorn in Jerusalem, the middle child, Ofer grew up in Beit Shemesh, attending religious schools in the city. After finishing high school, he enlisted in the IDF, first positioned in the Nahal Haredi Battalion, but later requesting a move, ultimately serving as a cook on the Ramon Air Force Base.\nAfter his release, Ofer spent 9 months touring around India, which included several months based around the Chabad House helping them prepare for Passover. The experience brought him closer to religion, and though he wasn’t strictly observant, he identified with the Breslov sect, including spending Rosh Hashana in Uman, Ukraine, every year for 14 years.\nHe underwent professional training in crane operation, truck driving and heavy lifting, and worked in the field ever since, including buying his own semi-trailer truck in 2019 to set up his own business. He married and had two children — in 2017 and 2019 — before divorcing. In his spare time, he loved jeep rides and offroad biking as well as listening to a wide range of music.\n“I miss Ofer, his laugh, his presence,” his mother, Sara, told a local news site. “His kids miss him so much. They were the loves of his life. He was a very devoted father and made sure they were never lacking anything.”\nSara said Mor and Lavi “really miss him, that’s their father and his loss is very felt. It’s not easy at all. Ofer had many aspirations and he had started to achieve them. This was just the beginning, he set out on his own business-wise, worked really hard, earned a good living, he was a man of generosity and kindness,” she added, saying how many stories they heard during the shiva mourning period about people he had helped, “and he never told us any of it. He did it quietly and secretly.”\nHis sister, Maya, told the site, “Ofer is missed at every moment. Fridays are hard — Ofer would make kiddush at my parents’ house and was the most dominant figure at home. He was always at the barbecue… Ofer was an incredible father and really doted on his kids.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 172 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

Yishay Fitusi, 21, a soldier in the Golani Brigade’s Battalion 13, from Talmon, was killed while battling the Hamas invasion of the Nahal Oz IDF outpost on October 7.\nYishay and his comrades were on a routine patrol near the border when the Hamas attack began. They were called back to the base when news came that it had been attacked by Hamas gunmen.\nNear the entrance of the base, their APC was hit by RPG fire, and they all had to get out and fight face-to-face against the gunmen. Yishay was slain along with his commander, Maj. Shilo Har-Even, Staff Sgt. Dvir Zakai, Staff Sgt. Dor Yarhi, Staff Sgt. Roy Bareket and Staff Sgt. Yaad Ben Yaakov.\nYishay’s battalion commander, Lt. Col. Tomer Grinberg, who was killed later fighting in Gaza, called his parents before entering the Strip and told them that Yishay had fought bravely to his last bullet.\nHe was buried on October 12 on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. He is survived by his parents, Inbal and Yitzhak, and siblings, Yair, Noam, Ohad, Roi, and Talya.\nYishay, the fifth child, was born in Gush Katif, the Jewish settlements in Gaza, where he lived until they were evacuated during the 2005 disengagement. They lived in caravans in Yad Binyamin for many years until they settled in the West Bank settlement of Talmon.\nYishay attended a yeshiva high school in the settlement of Kiryat Arba near Hebron before enlisting in the army in August 2021, joining the Golani Brigade.\n“Yishay was a magical kid with a massive smile and the most beautiful eyes in the world. He looked at everyone at eye level without any ego, no matter who you were or where you came from,” his brother Yair told Channel 14 in an interview.\nHis mother, Inbal, told Arutz Sheva that Yishay wouldn’t rest when he got home from his base on Fridays.\n“He would put his bag down, make schnitzels, help with preparations for Shabbat, take some snacks and drinks and meet with troubled youth who needed the strength and encouragement Yishay gave them,” she said.\nHis father, Yitzhak, told the 103FM radio station that Yishay was deeply connected with all his fellow soldiers and always spoke positively of people.\n“Yishay was so connected… with everyone, with his soldiers, with troubled youth.” He had a dedicated hangout spot in Talmon “and he would sit there with wayward youth for hours, and helped them get into pre-military academies and to enlist.”\nAfter he was killed, Yitzhak said they found a notebook in which he’d asked everyone to write positive things about each other: “That was really Yishay, his connection, his pride, his depth.”\nIn an interview with Talmon’s local paper, his sister Talya said that what stuck with her was Yishay’s “modesty and humility.”\n“He wasn’t one of those standout kids. He was one of the modest ones on the side who got things done. He had an incredible light,” she said, adding that he was “indescribably special to me.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

That was the last anyone heard from him.\nThe last time Maayan had any contact with her loved ones, she was telling a friend on the phone that Nissim was trying to protect her from the gunshots. All three friends were murdered in the Hamas attack.\nFor several days, Nissim’s family assumed he had been taken hostage, but on October 11, the IDF located his body among others on the Gaza border.\nHe was buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem on October 15. He is survived by his son, Ofri, 4, his parents, Miriam Simcha and Yaakov, and a sister.\nNissim was raised in an ultra-Orthodox home in Eilat, according to a state eulogy, but began to distance himself from religion in his late teens. Still, he maintained a close relationship with his family and they said he would always put tefillin on daily. When he was 24 he got married and the couple had Ofri, but they divorced two years later though continued to co-parent with love.\nHe worked as a delivery man and was described by friends and colleagues as a hard worker who did his best to make an honest living for his son. Businesses and fellow delivery people in Rehovot said he was well-known for his respect and his constant smile, warmth and joy.\nHis mother, Miriam Simcha, said in an interview with Arutz Sheva that “he was a happy boy with endless generosity and unimaginable love for others.

    "story": "First Sgt. Aharon Arthur Markovitzi, 46, a coordinator in the Israel Police’s procurement and sales unit, from Holon, was killed while battling the Hamas attack on the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nA survivor from the rave told a local news outlet that Arthur stood on guard as partygoers fled and protected them from the wave of Hamas terrorists, even after he was wounded by gunfire. Social media videos from the day of the attack show him and other police officers setting up a roadblock as they fired back at Hamas gunmen.\nArthur told his commander that he had been wounded, but he continued to remain in position until he was hit by an RPG and was killed, according to eyewitnesses. His body was not identified for five days after his death.\nArthur was buried on October 13 on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. He is survived by his wife, Revital, their four children, Noam, 19, Stav, 18, Yuval, 13, and Shay, 8, his parents, Zev and Mina, and his sister, Shirley.\nBorn in Bucharest, Romania, Arthur and his parents moved to Israel when he was two years old, settling first in Bat Yam and then Holon, where his younger sister was born, according to a police eulogy. He studied at the Holtz Air Force High School in Holon, before enlisting in the IDF and serving on the Tel Hashomer base.\nAfter his release he worked at a number of jobs in order to fund his studies, earning a bachelor’s degree in economics and business administration at Bar Ilan University. He worked at many different companies, including Motorola, Pelephone, Egged, Nanonics and even as an aide to a member of Knesset, but always dreamed of pursuing a security career.\nIn 2021 he achieved his lifelong dream, enlisting in the Israel Police and joining its logistical branch, something his family said gave him great satisfaction.\nArthur met Revital in 2000 and they wed in 2002, building their life in Jerusalem where they had four children. In August 2023, just months before his death, the Markovitzi family moved into their dream home in Ashkelon. He loved to read and do crosswords, enjoyed Israeli musical artists and most of all loved spending time with his family, they said.\nHis daughter, Noam, told a Holon news outlet that after she completes her national service she plans to enlist in the Israel Police in his honor.\n“Dad, I plan to volunteer for the police,” she said. “I want to bring you happiness and make you proud of me… you’re my hero. I’m here to continue what you didn’t finish. I’m here to take care of and to love Mom and my siblings. Dad, I will love you forever.”\nArthur’s wife, Revital, told a Jerusalem news outlet that her husband “was a man of peace, someone everybody loved, happy and funny with a great sense of humor. Our home was always full of music.” Arthur, she said, “could never be mad or hold a grudge, everything with him was with a smile and peace… never judgment or criticism.”\nDespite his devotion to the police force, Arthur always put his family first, she said, “he was simply the kind of dad and uncle that everybody wants. He was involved in the kids’ lives and loved by everyone. He would go to parents’ nights, trips, school activities. When the extended family would get together, Arthur could always be found with the kids, playing with them.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Nehoray Said, 21, a soldier in the Kfir Brigade from Ofakim, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of his hometown.\nNehoray was home with his family the morning of the attack, but when he heard of the Hamas invasion, he grabbed his weapon and headed outside, according to a municipal eulogy. There he joined up with two other civilians who had also headed out to fight, including Rabbi Shachar Butzhak.\nButzhak told the Makor Rishon newspaper that the three decided to stay together. After killing a number of terrorists, a Hamas gunmen opened fire at them, and Butzhak was shot in the knee while Nehoray was killed on the spot.\nAmid the chaos, his family was not officially notified of his death for three days. He was buried in Ofakim on October 10. He is survived by parents, Hagit and Zohar, and his four siblings, Meytal, Batel, Galor and Tohar, and his girlfriend, Ella.\nThe youngest of his siblings, Nehoray was raised in Ofakim, attending local religious schools. He was active in the Bnei Akiva youth group and loved to travel around the country, spending time next to the Kinneret or along the Israel Trail, his loved ones said. He was known for his sense of humor and always cracking a joke, but was also serious about the things that were important to him.\nIn December 2021, Nehoray enlisted in the IDF and was placed in the Kfir Brigade’s Shimshon Battalion, undergoing training as a driver and to operate a machine gun and grenade launcher.\n“Nehoray was a man of action and joy, helping others and boundless love of the land,” wrote his sister, Tohar, on Facebook. “He loved to travel around the north with his girlfriend and friends, and one of the things he loved to eat was toast with tons of butter and garlic,” a dish they have chosen to memorialize him with, “to continue his life, as he willed to us with his death. We should only be worthy.”\nNehoray’s girlfriend of seven years, Ella, wrote on a memorial Instagram page recalling one of their trips together to the Sea of Galilee (Kinneret), sitting and talking “and I’m pretty sure that you made me laugh and I annoyed you, because that’s just us… and I felt the happiest person in the world, just because I had you.”\nElla said that Nehoray handed her a black marker and asked her to write on their trip bag a sentence, and she wrote: “The brave might not live forever, but those who are afraid don’t live at all.”\n“You are brave, always were and always will be. You look danger in the eye and don’t cower, with an unapologetic smile you know the right thing to do and don’t delay along the way,” she added. “You lived a simple life, full of truth, kindness and generosity, you were devoted to everything you believed in, your family, your friends, me. But at the very top — our country.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Yagev Buchshtav, 35, was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists from his home in Kibbutz Nirim on October 7 and brought to Gaza. In July 2024, the IDF confirmed that he had been slain while in captivity. His body was recovered on August 19, 2024, and returned to Israel for burial.\nYagev was kidnapped from his home along with his wife, Rimon Buchshtav Kirsht, who was released in November 2023 as part of a weeklong truce. The couple was held together, and Rimon said she did not want to leave him behind, but was forced to do so by their captors. Yagev’s mother said that they were told Yagev was executed by Hamas in February 2024 inside a tunnel as IDF troops were closing in.\nHis body was recovered by IDF troops from Khan Younis alongside those of Avraham Munder, Nadav Popplewell, Alex Dancyg, Chaim Peri and Yoram Metzger — who were all kidnapped alive and slain in captivity — during a military operation in August 2024.\nYagev was buried in Kibbutz Nirim on August 21, 2024. The family had already sat shiva after his death was confirmed a month earlier. He is survived by his wife, Rimon, his parents, Esther and Oren, and his younger siblings Nufar and Yuval.\nHe was a musician and soundman who built his own instruments, including electric guitars. He and Rimon were high school sweethearts who played together in the same band before losing touch and reconnecting a few years ago, getting married in 2021.\nThey both loved music and animals, filling their home with both, including several cats and multiple dogs. They rescued abused animals and brought them home to rehabilitate them with love.\nAdele Raemer, who lived next to the Buchshtav home in Nirim, recalled in a Times of Israel blog post always hearing “music. And sawing. Music, because that was what Yagev loved, and he practiced often, experimenting with different sounds and tempos. Sawing, because both the boys loved to work with wood, carving statues and building musical instruments.”\nYagev “was a talented craftsman and musician who loved experimenting with different sounds,” she wrote. “He grew up in my backyard. Literally. His parents’ home is right behind mine. He was kidnapped on October 7 together with his wife Rimon. She had been a student of mine: sharp as a whip and no one’s fool. She grew up on Kibbutz Magen, right nearby. They were high school sweethearts who went their own ways during the army, then found each other again, and became inseparable. They had a home filled with music and pets and love.”\nYagev’s sister, Nufar, shared on Facebook the eulogy she gave at his memorial ceremony: “I don’t know how to sum up an entire life in just a few lines. You’re so much more than a big brother and a musician and a loving husband to Rimon and a talented cook.”\nNufar said Yagev “always was and always will be my big brother, the one who understands everything, who I can seek advice from on a million topics and somehow always finds the right answer. The fact that amid all that knowledge you always stayed modest and quiet says everything. In so many ways you were better than all of us, you always succeeded in seeing others, looking at the sides and seeing those who were invisible… you taught me to believe in people and not to close my eyes.”\nAt Yagev’s funeral in August, Rimon said: “I wanted to say thank you. Thank you for saving me. Not just on October 7 — you’ve been saving me for years.\n“Thank you for teaching me about love and for making me stronger, I love you,” she said, adding that he “deserved so much better.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 178 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

Our long conversations, our car rides playing Eyal Golan songs, and you were always driving. Our car is waiting for you in the parking spot, I promise I’ll let you drive it anytime you want.”\nAriel’s girlfriend, Maayan, told a defense news site that he “had the kindest eyes and the biggest heart there was, he helped everyone, always with a smile and humility — that’s what captivated me from the beginning.”\nMaayan said Ariel “was humble and quiet, his modesty is what drew me to his heart.” Everywhere he went “he was always surrounded by friends, he was always at the heart of things and always made everybody laugh.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Avi Hasday, 53, from Ramat Gan, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Zikim Beach on October 7.\nAvi set out early that Saturday morning to meet up with friends and go fishing along the beach, one of his favorite hobbies. When the rocket fire began, he sought safety in a nearby bomb shelter, but when Hamas terrorists invaded the area they attacked those hiding in the shelter with grenades and gunfire, and Avi was killed. In total, 19 civilians who were on the beach that morning were slain in the attack.\nAfter 10 days with no word, Avi’s family was informed that his body had been found. He was buried in Tel Aviv on October 17. He is survived by his wife, Efrat, their three children, Lia, Sagiv and Amit, his mother, Carmela and sister, Ronit. He was predeceased by his father, Aharon.\nAvi grew up in Lod, attending elementary school in the city and high school in nearby Ramle, according to a state eulogy. During his mandatory military service, he served as a helicopter technician in the Air Force, stationed at the Palmahim airbase.\nAfter being released, Avi began working at the Hashmal Yashir company in the field of sales and marketing, staying there for 31 years as a devoted employee. In 2021, he left the company and began working at the Kahane group, managing sales and marketing for its solar energy division.\nIn 2004, Avi married Efrat, and they had three children, making their home in Ramat Gan. He was a devoted dad, spending weekends with his family when he wasn’t out fishing with his friends — one of his favorite pastimes, and for which he purchased professional equipment.\nAvi’s brother-in-law, Ilan, recalled meeting him at age 14 or 15, “young, smiling, calm, but full of energy, charismatic, smart, sharp.” In later years, he wrote, “you met Efrat and together you built an incredible relationship, and established a warm nest and brought Lia, Amit and Sagiv into the world, and you were on cloud nine.”\nIlan recounted times they would go out fishing together, with Avi’s late father. “You and me with a thermos of coffee, some borekas or sandwiches from home, sitting for hours, with lightning in your eyes waiting for a fish… You brought your enjoyment [of fishing] to new heights every time… and ultimately it brought you to your end.”\nHis wife, Efrat, wrote online about how much he loved fishing, a hobby “that fulfilled you, gave you good energy, it was so fun to see your smile and your love for it, that you made sure to do the thing you loved.”\nThrough that hobby, she said, “Your life was ended and so was ours. They cut off your life, all the love and the excitement and the fun and the experiences we were supposed to keep having together.”\n“Our Avi. You’re a wonderful person with so much action and generosity, made sure nothing was lacking, that everyone would find success in their work and in what they desired,” added Efrat. “You’re an incredible conversationalist, our support system.

When they heard gunshots outside, Michael grabbed his pistol and ran outside in his pajamas to battle the terrorist invasion.\nHe was eventually killed by two terrorists who shot him from behind.\nMichael was buried in Ofakim on October 11. He is survived by his wife, Ligal, daughter, Lihi, 1, his parents, Inbar and Eyal, and his three sisters, Shani, Or and Adi.\nMichael dreamed of becoming a police officer from a young age and attended the Kannot boarding school, which has a program for kids intending to join the police force, according to a municipal eulogy. His teachers and counselors from the school described him as someone who always kept the peace among his friends and was dominant and loved by everyone.\nHe then attended a pre-military academy before enlisting in the IDF, serving in the Golani Brigade’s anti-tank company. After his release, he worked as a security guard, during which time he met Ligal, and in March 2021, he joined the police force. He began officer training earlier than most in his position, eager to advance, and was also pursuing a bachelor’s degree in criminology.\nHis mother, Inbar, described her son to a local Beersheba news outlet as “a modest person with a big heart.”\nShe said Michael was an excellent father to baby Lihi, describing how he took mostly night shifts for a month and a half while she was kept home because of a case of abuse in her daycare so that he could look after her during the day.\nHis wife, Ligal said she knew Michael would be her husband and the father of her kids from the moment they first met.\n“There was a special love between us, and I felt that God made him just for me,” she said, adding that he was a “special man, husband and father.”\n“Michael was the best father in the world, he was addicted to Lihi. While he was at work, he would ask me to send him photos and videos of her and would just wait for his shift to end so he could come back and give her a kiss,” she said.\nLigal added that “what set Michael apart was his endless giving and how he always thought of others before himself. He was always the first to help and volunteer for everyone who needed it.”\nFollowing in her brother’s footsteps, Shani joined the police force to be a detective in December 2023, and was given Michael’s gun that he had used to fight the terrorists. Inbar told Ynet that her other two daughters, Adi and Or, were also in the process of joining the police force.\n“If I would have had a weapon that day, I would have also joined the fighting,” said Shani.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 181 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

When the massive rocket fire began, they got into the armored personnel carriers and began preparing to return mortar fire, according to a memorial site.\nSoon they heard nearby gunfire, and realized that there was a terrorist invasion and got out of the APCs and split up to defend the outpost’s rear gate from the attack. Amir and others were wounded, and decided to head inside the outpost, and holed up inside the on-base cafeteria, which was also the bomb shelter.\nA group of Hamas terrorists blew up the gate and stormed the room, killing Amir and two of his comrades — Sgt. Nahman Dekel and Staff Sgt. Tal Levy — and three other Nahal soldiers, Staff Sgt. Amit Most, Staff Sgt. Gali Shakotai and Staff Sgt. Ofir Melman.\nAmir was buried on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem on October 12. He is survived by his parents, Rachel and Elad, and his younger sister, Tamar.\nRachel and Elad shared that two months before he was killed, Amir created a playlist for his own funeral full of songs about living. They said they were horrified at first by the initiative, but later realized how important it was to him.\nRachel told the Kan public broadcaster that Amir had told her, “If I’m gone, don’t sit around crying all day. I want you to keep listening to music.”\nAmir was a talented artist and musician who studied at the prestigious Israel Arts and Science Academy for high school. After his death, Israeli singer Yoni Bloch used one of his sketches for his new single.\nAmir’s family described him as a “beloved son and a wonderful brother, grandson, and cousin.”\nDescribing the sort of brother Amir was on a memorial Instagram page, Tamar shared a memory of when the two were sleeping at their grandparents’ house and she woke up scared during the night.\n“You hugged me so tight until I fell asleep, and all I want is another hug like that,” she wrote. “The values and things you taught me are still with me, and you are the biggest inspiration in my life.”\nTamar also wrote that Amir had a lot of friends who were like siblings to him and that they had been there to support her since he died.\n“Amir changed me completely,” his girlfriend, Yuval, wrote, adding that he “taught me how to love and how to feel loved, made me happy and made me believe that someone actually loves me and thinks I’m beautiful, which is something no one had ever done before.”\nOn a memorial page set up for Amir by his family, his friends all described how he introduced them to music they loved and how much knowledge he had about the music he shared with them.\n“I think Amir was a big reason why our group of friends managed to form and stay so close. We’re all stressed and competitive physicists who probably would have lost it at each other a long time ago, but Amir knew how to lighten the mood. [He knew how to] have some fun with music and speakers in one hand, and good beer in the other, and everything is fine,” wrote his friend, Libby.\nAnother friend, Stav, wrote that he was “the most welcoming guy you would ever meet.”\n“Amir was such a good friend that your friends would meet him and be jealous for a moment that he wasn’t their friend too. But then the jealousy would pass because he would connect with them too, and even if you left, he would stay with them, pour them a glass of whiskey and get to know them,” she wrote.\nTamar, another friend of Amir’s, said that he “was the best person I had ever met in the purest sense of the word” who “always did the right thing.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Cpt. Nitay Amar, 22, a combat engineering officer in the Gaza Division’s Southern Gaza Brigade, from Kibbutz Alumim, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the Re’im IDF base.\nNitay was home with his family for the holiday weekend in Kibbutz Alumim, but when he heard of the attack, he hurried back to the Gaza Division’s headquarters at the Re’im base.\nHis father, Michael, told Ynet that “when the sirens started we all jumped up to go to the bomb shelter, and Nitay didn’t come. He said ‘I have to run’ but he didn’t say why.”\nMichael said they believe Nitay “saw in the commanders’ WhatsApp group about the terror invasion of the Gaza Division and decided to join them and help. We accompanied him to the car and we parted ways — we didn’t know it was the last time we’d see each other.” His family remained holed up in the bomb shelter for more than 24 hours before they were ultimately rescued unharmed.\nOn his way to the base, Nitay’s car came under fire and he abandoned it at the side of the road, continuing on foot until he arrived. He managed to get to the base and fought there against the Hamas invasion for several hours until he was killed in the firefight. His final conversation was with his girlfriend at 1:43 p.m., not long before he died.\nHe was buried on October 10 in Netanya. He is survived by his parents, Revital and Michael, and his four siblings, Yahel, Matar, Maayan and Alma.\nBorn and raised in Kibbutz Alumim, next to the Gaza border, Nitay’s family said he was a computer whiz and dreamed of one day founding his own startup. He enlisted in the IDF in November 2020, undergoing a squad commanders course and later an officer’s course.\nHis girlfriend, Eden Itzhakov, wrote on Instagram that she was “privileged to be by your side for almost four years — you are my pride and joy! I am proud of the path you took and who you are. You’re the best man in the world, the most beautiful, your huge heart, your kind eyes, your sensitivity, your bravery — you taught me what happiness is.”\nEden wrote that Nitay “fought until the last moment to protect and defend us. You followed your morals and your values to the end and I am proud of you. You were and will remain forever our hero, a pure boy, simply an angel in the shape of a man… we planned a whole life together, we planned every moment, we talked about finishing the army, marrying and setting up a modest and small home… Our love is endless and indescribable.”\nOn what would have been Nitay’s 23rd birthday, his mother, Revital, wrote on Instagram: “Today is Nitay’s birthday, but he has not aged another year. He remains 22, and the pain again wounds the body and pierces the heart.”\n“Nitay my love, nine months I carried you inside me, and now nine months I have been carrying you in my heart,” she added. “On your birthday I wish for myself that I will find more success in the world of joy, and even when I visit the world of sadness, I won’t stay there too long, just drop in for a moment, and return.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 184 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Arie (Arik) Hefetz, 28, from Ramle, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while fleeing the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHe left the rave via car, and was driving when terrorists opened fire on the vehicle, wounding him in the leg. He later sought refuge in a roadside bomb shelter near Kibbutz Alumim, where he was murdered along with seven others, including Laurie Vardi, Barak Davidi and Sun Yakobov.\nHe was buried in Ramle on October 11. He is survived by his parents, Genya and Klimenty, and his two brothers, Shimon and Gai.\nBorn and raised in Ramle, Arie was the middle of his two brothers, attending schools in the city. His original name was Arik, but at a young age he decided it was not dignified enough, and changed it to Arie, according to a state eulogy.\nArie had an entrepreneurial spirit from a very young age, his loved ones said, even starting to work at a supermarket at age 11 to save up money and become financially independent — pursuing his dream of becoming a millionaire.\nAfter completing a financial advisor’s course, he worked advising and coaching others with their money, and on social media was active in sharing financial advice online. He also had taken courses in NLP and theta-healing and considered himself spiritually connected, with a desire to pass that onto others. On his leg he tattooed the word “Creator,” which was later engraved on his headstone.\nIn 2021, Arie was interviewed for a Ynet article about young adults who had returned to living with their parents during COVID: “It’s an emotional experience to suddenly come back. I lived in Tel Aviv for a year and I came home to Mom,” he said. “There aren’t any pubs or nightlife, so at least I have Mom’s food.”\nHe was very close to his nephews, Itamar and Ofri, and dreamed of one day becoming a father himself, his loved ones said. He was also very devoted to his dog, Mika, and took her with him almost everywhere, including trips overseas. Before settling in Tel Aviv in the months just before he was killed, Arie spent a long stretch overseas, visiting India, Mexico, the Caribbean and Europe.\nMarking 30 days since he was killed, his sister-in-law, Rinat, wrote on Facebook that Arie was “a beloved boy, smiling and sweet who became a beloved man, always doing things for others, with hands of gold and a pure heart.”\nRinat wrote that she is always thinking “of your constant smile and the good energy you would bring with you everywhere and in every situation… I would always wait for you to arrive at any event or family meal, to bring with you good vibes, interesting conversations and 200% attention and pure fun for my kids. Now there is an empty hole that nobody can fill at every family gathering… we’ll never be the same family again.”\nIn a memorial video produced by the Ramle municipality, Arie’s mother, Genya, described how he surprised her by coming home early from India: “He called me and said, ‘Mom, what are you doing, I’m in India, planning on coming back in two weeks’ and then he suddenly rang the doorbell.”\n“The joy he had when he saw me and the joy I had to see him — that’s what I think about all the time,” she said. “He was a guy who loved life… he was a happy guy, he was super optimistic, he wanted kids and a family.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Tareq Khatib, 44, from Ofakim, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in the city on October 7.\nWith the start of the attack, Tareq and his family awoke, and took shelter in their bathroom, as they did not have a bomb shelter. About a half hour after the sirens began, his mother called and said they should come and stay with her, since she had a reinforced room, but they decided to stay home and wait it out instead.\nTareq nevertheless decided to go check up on his mother, worried that she was alone during the sirens, and set out on his electric bike around 7:20 a.m., according to a municipal eulogy. When his wife, Rivka, heard that there was a terrorist invasion of Ofakim, she called Tareq and heard screaming before the call was cut off.\nTareq was shot dead in the street by a cell of Hamas terrorists. Around 11 a.m., Tareq’s brother sent Rivka a video showing his body lying in the street next to his bike. At 3 a.m. Sunday morning, Rivka brought her children to her mother’s house and went to Tareq’s body, finding him riddled with 12 bullet holes, and sat with him until first responders were able to evacuate him and 13 other bodies who were lying in the same area.\nHe was buried in Rahat several days later. He is survived by his wife, Rivka, their three children, Liam, 10, Leeham, 8 and Barel, 2 months, as well as his mother, Karima, and his five siblings — Muhammad, Jihad, Zahed, Khalil and Etidal. Four of the siblings live in Israel, while one lives in Gaza.\nBorn in Egypt, Tareq moved to Israel when he was 7, settling with his family in the Bedouin town of Rahat in the south, according to a state eulogy. After finishing school, he began working as a garbage truck driver for the Ashkelon municipality.\nHe met Rivka Baruch, and the couple built a life together, having three children and settling in the Jewish town of Ofakim. (He was buried in Rahat as the Ofakim cemetery doesn’t have a Muslim section.)\nThe couple’s youngest, Barel Zohar, was not yet two months old when Tareq was killed. She was named in honor of Barel Shmueli, a Border Police officer who was shot and killed along the Gaza border fence in 2021. “At least he got to meet her, to be at her birth, to be with her a little bit,” said Rivka in video testimony about the attack.\n“He was an incredibly wonderful person, a man who loved justice,” Rivka told Ynet. “He never did wrong to anybody in his whole life. He didn’t deserve this.”\nHe was a devoted family man and a lover of animals, his loved ones said, caring for and rehabilitating dogs who had suffered abuse.\n“My son Tareq, he worked for the municipality, on the garbage truck, he went from work to home and home to work, he never went anywhere else,” Karima said in video testimony. “If he went anywhere else it was to come to me or to his brother… He just had a baby, six weeks old. It’s hard, so hard. A mother who buries her child while she’s still alive — it’s better if she dies.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Worried about his girlfriend home alone in Kibbutz Erez, Evgeny headed to their home from his shift in Netivot and was slain by Hamas terrorists along the way, near the Sha’ar Hanegev Junction.\nHe was buried in Beersheba on October 8. He is survived by his mother, Ludmilla, sister Evelin (Eva) and his girlfriend, Rotem. Evgeny was posthumously promoted to the rank of sergeant in the Israel Fire and Rescue Services.\nEvgeny joined the Fire and Rescue Services in July 2020 and underwent a number of training courses and certifications, including training as a paramedic.

Evgeny was one of a number of active bikers killed during the Hamas attack, including Tomer Shpirer, who he was slated to train with later that day.\nHis girlfriend, Rotem Rada, asked the Strauss company to create a special memorial line of Evgeny’s favorite drink, their Yotvata vanilla protein shake, describing him as “a brave firefighter, a man of mountains and bike riding, adventurous, humble and full of endless generosity.

Martin was running in between our legs, you breathed deeply and said that you felt whole… that you found your niche in life as a firefighter, how full of motivation you were to advance and to take charge.”\nOver the years, Yulia wrote, “My heart and my head stored every memory of you, even the most minor… I will always remember you, talk about you with a smile and be thankful for every moment I knew a man like this… a good friend, sensitive to those around you, moral, unique and special.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 187 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Neria Ben David, 22, a squad commander in the Combat Engineering Corps, from Haifa, was killed on October 7 while battling the Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Be’eri.\nAt the start of the Hamas attack, Neria and his troops were stationed in Otniel in the South Hebron Hills, and they were quickly sent toward the front lines near Gaza, according to an IDF eulogy. When they got to the area near Kibbutz Yad Mordechai, they encountered a terrorist cell and engaged in a gun battle, killing them.\nNeria and his squad then arrived at Netiv Ha’asara, and worked to rescue dozens of people by bringing them to safety via the town’s rear gate. His team was then sent to Kibbutz Be’eri, arriving there as the sun was setting that evening. Neria sent his family several messages throughout the day, assuring them that he was OK, including at 9:07 p.m.\nThe troops were sent in to the youth wing of the kibbutz, rescuing dozens of those who had been trapped for hours amid the fighting. Around 10:30 p.m. that evening, Neria encountered a cell of terrorists still inside the kibbutz and was shot dead in the firefight.\nHe was buried on October 11 on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem — a day before his sister had been slated to get married. He is survived by his parents, Michal and Baruch, and his seven siblings, Akiva, Moriah, Hillel, Renana, Odeya, Avichai and Yehezkel.\nBorn and raised in Haifa, Neria was fourth in his family of eight siblings, attending religious schools in Rekhasim and later in Migdal Haemek and the Golan Heights. He was always connected to the land, the environment, agriculture and animals, his family said, attending a high school that combined Torah studies with agricultural work, and later volunteering on a farm in the Lower Galilee, including working with retired police dogs.\nHe enlisted in the IDF in March 2022 and joined the Combat Engineering Corps, later completing a squad commanders’ course. During his brief breaks from his army service, he would make sure to return to visit and work at the farm where he had been volunteering.\nMoshe Ofer, the principal of his high school, told a local radio station that Neria was “a special young man with great powers of action and generosity, the first to volunteer for everything with great diligence… He grew up with the values of doing the most and taking initiative and everything modestly, without seeking attention or seeking credit, but quietly and humbly.”\nNeria’s mother, Michal, told a local news outlet that her son was “a boy with a unique joy for life, and brought us great light, our sense as parents was always that we were privileged to have him.”\nHe “was very connected to the Land of Israel, he loved it and felt a strong tie to it,” she said. When he would return home from working at the farm with his clothes covered in mud, she said, “I would say to him, ‘Neria, what is all this dirt,’ and he’d say to me, ‘Mom, it’s not dirt, it’s the mud of the Land of Israel.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Their car was later found abandoned near Kibbutz Mefalsim, and loved ones searched for any sign of them for several days. After a week, Alisia’s body was located and identified. Steven was also slain during the attack.\nAlisia was buried on October 15 in Karmiel. She is survived by her son, Shon, daughter, Daniela, parents Yudmilla and Andrey, sister Yulia and her identical twin Lina.\nA certified personal trainer, Alisia loved her career and was known all around the Galilee area for her work. She and her identical twin, also a personal trainer, dreamed of opening their own studio together. In February 2024, Lina turned their dream into a reality, opening up “Twins Fitness” in Alisia’s memory, decorating the studio with images of them together and dedicating it to her.\nAlisia was also a doting mom to her two teenage children, whom she raised as a single mother, never letting them feel that anything was lacking in their lives.\n“Alisia Levin was a wonderful person,” wrote her friend Eran Bluestein on Facebook. “I spent many hours sweating away at the Crossfit box with her. She always had an infectious smile and was always there to give a supportive nudge or egg me on when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore. She was beautiful and was always so full of life and joy.”\nHer friend Liat Damti wrote online that Alisia “was a role model for all of us, a mentor in your soul.” She lived life “with joy and at a high frequency that everything was p-e-r-f-e-c-t. Working out in the first row with you always made me feel how much willpower I have and how much I really want it… My heart is broken, shattered, hurting, bleeding.”\nIn an Instagram post, Alisia’s identical twin Lina joked that in most of their photos together they weren’t facing each other, “since we both have the same good side,” and would argue over who would give in to the other.\n“If only I could give in to you and take one more photo with you, one more memory, one more shared experience,” she wrote. “I miss you so intensely, the memories of you just choke me and are accompanied by pain that burrows into the heart.”\nShe wrote, “My love, my other half, my twin sister, I love you immensely. Thank you for all the strength, for the ability to keep going in workouts, you are with me in every workout class, allowing me not to give up or to break.”\n“Thank you for your incredible kids, who are our kids, every hug from them fills me with unconditional love and I will never give up on them,” she added. “I love them with a full heart as if they were my own — I’ll never replace you as a mother but I will try to give them love that only a mother can.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Itay Banjo, 27, from Haifa, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while trying to flee the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nItay attended the party with his friend, Shani Kupervaser, and when the invasion began, the two tried to escape to Beersheba in Itay’s car. They were attacked by terrorists on the way and ended up in a roadside bomb shelter where they were eventually murdered.\nFor a week his family searched for any word of his fate, until they were informed that his body had been identified.\nItay was buried on October 15 in Haifa. He is survived by his parents, Zehava and Yaakov, and his brothers, Matan and Maor.\nBorn and raised in Haifa, Itay completed his mandatory military service in the Nahal Brigade, finishing with distinction, according to a state eulogy. After his release he worked to save up money before departing on a six-month trip around South America.\nUpon his return, he started a degree in materials science at Ben-Gurion University. When he was killed, Itay had just begun his master’s degree at Ben-Gurion University, where he was also working full-time. In his free time, he liked to party and dance with his friends and was described by loved ones as an optimist.\nHis parents, Zehava and Yaakov told Haifa’s local news publication, Haipo, that Itay was their youngest son.\n“He was a smart and funny kid who excelled at everything he did. He loved to get into mischief,” they said.\n“Itay was a serious person, but he also loved parties, friends, and fun, and he combined the two perfectly. His hobbies were partying, going to the beach and Maccabi Haifa (soccer team),” said his brother Matan.\nEven though it had been more than a decade since Itay graduated from high school, his teacher, Vera, remembered him as a social student who was an excellent friend.\n“He was a boy with a huge heart, a fine sense of humor, and a massive smile. He was one of the pillars of his class, loved by everyone, teachers and students alike,” she said.\nBrit, a friend of Itay’s from university, said he was easy to connect to.\n“Outside of university life, he would always host people. He knew how to cook like a grandmother for her grandchildren, and he would produce excellent Friday night meals,” she said, adding that “most importantly, he was a true friend: always listening, and I always knew I could count on him for anything.”\nAnother university friend of Itay’s, Nitay, wrote that he was “a smart and intelligent person with a good head on his shoulders.”\n“Itay was a person who was full of joy, always laughing, always making the mood lighter, a person who loved sarcasm,” he said.\nAnother friend, Yoav, wrote that Itay knew that he was new to Beersheba when he had just moved there and that Itay had made sure to look out for him and take care of him.\n“I was always amazed by how smart he was and how he invested everything he had into success. In our conversations, Itay always made sure to say how lucky he was to have such loving and supportive parents, family, and friends,” he wrote.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 190 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Cpt. Eyal Klein, 22, a team commander in the Nahal Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, from Kfar Harif, was killed on October 7 while battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nEyal was stationed that Saturday morning at an IDF outpost near the southern border of Gaza. Not long before the attack began, he and a group of soldiers set out on a routine patrol along the border, next to a memorial that was just outside Kibbutz Sufa. When the rocket fire began, they sought safety in a small bomb shelter but soon realized that terrorists had stormed the border, according to an IDF eulogy.\nThey engaged in a gun battle with the group of terrorists, killing five of them, and Eyal reached out to his commanders for backup, not knowing that there was a simultaneous mass invasion along the Gaza border. He was ultimately slain in the firefight at the memorial site alongside Staff Sgt. Daniel Bezgodov.\nHe was buried on October 11 in Kfar Harif. He is survived by his parents, Hagit and Amir, and his older brothers Guy and Ido.\nBorn and raised in Kfar Harif, a small moshav not far from Ashdod, Eyal, known as “Luli,” attended schools in the nearby Kibbutz Gat and Kibbutz Kfar Menahem. He loved to ride his bike, play computer games, play soccer and ride his scooter. As a young adult, he was always active, taking part in off-road biking with his family members, hiking around Israel, running long distances and ready to “jump into every spring and stream with his friends and his beloved dog, Harley, and stopping for a camp-stove coffee at any opportunity,” according to a memorial website.\nHe loved to experiment in the kitchen, always enjoyed his mother’s cooking and even learned how to make his own biltong, a South African beef jerky, that he shared with his friends and comrades, his loved ones said.\nHe was set on his goal of a combat role in the IDF, even joining a physical readiness program in 12th grade and always staying fit and active. He enlisted in the IDF in August 2019 and joined the Nahal Brigade’s special reconnaissance unit. He later successfully completed a sniper’s course, then a squad commander’s course and later an officer’s course, appointed first as a commander overseeing trainees in the Multidimensional unit and later as a team commander in Nahal.\nAt his funeral, his older brother, Guy, said that he could not imagine “that there was something in this world that could harm you.”\n“You always have your sly little smile implying that everything is fine, and everyone else are just crybabies. You are so optimistic, the goodness of your heart is unmatched,” he added. “From my little baby brother, you grew up to be a big and impressive man, full of smiles, so successful and good that we could only look at you in appreciation. Undoubtedly the successful kid of our family, and now Grandpa can say out loud what we all already know — that you’re his favorite grandchild.”\nGuy said there are “so many more things I was waiting to do together with you, and you had a million more plans you wanted to do,” including a big backpacking trip around the world and a family biking vacation to Romania, “where you would put us all to shame. Even just to go out for a beer in Tel Aviv and get you to throw up from alcohol. I promise you that we will achieve all your dreams together, and we’ll take you with you wherever we go.”\nEyal’s father, Amir, said at his funeral that he was “such a talented and smart kid. You have a heart of gold, immense willpower, the body of a swimmer and the face of a model — and yes, that smile, and you knew how to use it to get everything.”\nHis older brothers, he continued, “said you had ‘sticky hands,’ because you would steal from them clothes, shoes, and essentially anything you wanted. When you were caught — no problem, one smile and it was yours.”\n“Eyal, what can a father write to his son who was deemed ‘invincible’ — and still lost in the battle of his life.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

In total, six Thai workers were slain on the kibbutz that day.\nHis body arrived back in Thailand on October 20, and he was cremated in a Buddhist religious ceremony on October 23. He is survived by his parents, Panya and Somphit, his grandparents Sanit and Chan, and two brothers.\nThe eldest of the three children in the family, Anucha had been working in agriculture in Israel for four years out of a five-year contract, according to a Thai news outlet. He had been sending money regularly back to his family, and had already paid off all his debts and helped them build a new home.\nThe news site said that when Anucha’s five years were up in Israel, he planned to buy cows for his parents to raise when he returned home and “to farm and live a self-sufficient life.”\nThe website described him as “a good-natured person with a spirit of volunteerism,” who was often called on to talk to wayward youth in the village to convince them to behave for their parents, “making him beloved by the villagers.”\nHis grandmother, Sanit, told a local news outlet that she spoke to Anucha often while he was in Israel and was always worried about him, and after hearing of the Hamas attack she was unable to contact him and feared that he had been killed. “Now I’m very sad. My beloved grandson is no longer alive and has become a ghost.”\nAt his funeral, his mother, Somphit, said that he should “be proud” that many important officials came to the ceremony, and asked him “to go to heaven and become an angel and in the next life, let him be my son again,” according to a local outlet.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Daniel Meir Vadai, 27, from Jerusalem, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nWith the start of the attack, he sought safety in a roadside bomb shelter not far from the site of the party, and was slain there along with many others — including Hadar Hoshen, Kim Damti and Idan Herman.\nHe was buried on October 10 in Jerusalem. He is survived by his parents, Sarah and Rahamim, and his older siblings Ortal and Tomer.\nBorn and raised in the Pat neighborhood of Jerusalem as the youngest in the family, Daniel attended local schools, including the Kedma high school in Katamonim. From a young age he was a dedicated soccer player, playing in youth leagues for both the Beitar Jerusalem and Hapoel Katamon teams. But no matter which team he played for, Daniel was a sworn devotee of the Beitar Jerusalem professional team.\nTwo teammates he played with on Hapoel Katamon — Idan Dor and Ram Shalom — were also slain that day at the festival.\nAfter completing high school, Daniel enlisted in the IDF, serving in the Armored Corps’ emergency storage unit at a base outside Jerusalem — serving in a special track that allowed him to continue playing soccer. Following his release, he took a big trip to South America with his friends.\nNir Reichman, who coached Daniel, told a local news outlet that “Daniel was an incredible kid, very positive. This is a huge loss. He really loved to laugh, to play pranks, there was always a smile on his face. A kid whose whole life was ahead of him.”\nHis close friend, Yuval Revach, described him on Instagram as “my best friend in the world, the one who got me with just a look, who knew how to deal with all my moods.”\n“You’re the definition of a soul friend, a matching soul in the shape of my best friend, the one who comes in the middle of the night with food and a note that says ‘marry me’ just for laughs, the one who shows up in the middle of the night to check the oil in my car and to park it because I have no patience or I can’t do it — you would always come, always! Why aren’t you coming now?”\nDaniel’s sister-in-law, Gal, wrote on Instagram marking “100 days that you’re not here, 100 days that we aren’t close to understanding what happened, 100 days of endless longing alongside questions with no answers.”\n“There is no moment in the day and night that I don’t think about you, that I don’t miss you and just wanted to give you another hug and yell at you to stop annoying Yarin,” she added. “Thank you for every moment with you. I have a hole in my heart in the shape of you — and not just me, but the whole family and anyone who ever met you, even for a moment.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 193 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Josef Itamar Bruchim, 20, a commander in the Paratroopers Brigade from Ashdod, was killed battling Hamas terrorists in southern Israel on October 8, 2023.\nOn October 7, Itamar was at his girlfriend Lior’s house. When the sirens began and he realized what was happening, Itamar went home to pick up his gear and joined his commander and soldiers in Sderot where they rescued civilians who were trapped in their homes.\nThe next morning, he was wounded by a rocket fired by Hamas at Sderot and died a short while later in the hospital.\nHe was buried on October 11 in Ashdod. He is survived by his parents, Orly and Meir, his siblings, Inbal and Nadav, and his girlfriend Lior.\nItamar was an artistic person who enjoyed drawing, acting, and playing the guitar, the mandolin and the trombone, his loved ones said in a municipal obituary. He was only weeks away from getting out of his military service, was planning a post-army trip, and had signed up for an aircraft security course.\n“Itamar loved life, loved sport, and was a workout freak,” his father, Meir, told a local news outlet. “He knew love and a good relationship and lived every day like there was no tomorrow — with two feet on the ground and plans for the future.”\nAfter visiting the family, former prime minister Naftali Bennett said that Itamar’s parents told him that he had been a born leader.\nHis girlfriend, Lior, shared on a memorial page that he was a “special kid with a big heart and the willingness to invest and give of himself to those around him.”\nShe also wrote that Itamar had made a massive effort to be there to support her for one of her final ceremonies in basic training. After a night of training with his soldiers, Lior wrote, Itamar walked an hour to the bus station where he caught the first of multiple buses so that he could be there to support her.\nItamar’s best friend from high school, Erez, wrote that they did everything together, including working out, hiking, and a student exchange in Germany.\n“Even when most of our friends wouldn’t try new things, he went and tried them because he thought it was worth it. That was one of the things I learned from him and took into my own life — go with what you believe in and do it with a smile,” Erez wrote.\nAnother friend, Sharon, wrote that Itamar’s “smile would just light up any place he was and provide an atmosphere of warmth.”\n“One word from him was enough to make everyone cry from laughter and improve the mood in a moment. The thing I learned from Itamar was to live without fear, live in the moment, in the manner I want without worrying about what others think or say,” she wrote.\nOne of Itamar’s soldiers, Eliran, wrote that he had always known what to say and paid attention to the small things.\n“That’s how he was as a commander, always looking at the smallest details until everything was perfect. Just as he pushed me in training, he pushed the whole team to the highest level,” he wrote, adding that Itamar was “a golden man who taught me to keep pulling people forward.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

He spent much of the morning on the phone with his mother, updating her on the situation and warning her of the terrorists closing in. At 9:10 a.m., he was shot and wounded in his shoulder, and a paramedic tied a tourniquet on his arm.\nNot long afterward, Elia shouted that they were shooting at him and the connection with his mother was cut off. For three days she searched for any word or sign of him, until she was informed that his body had been identified.\nElia was buried on October 10 in Ashkelon. He is survived by his son, Lavi Michael, his girlfriend, Mor, his mother, Batsheva, and his older siblings Osher, Aviv and Libat. His father, Michael, died when he was 2 years and four months old — the same age Lavi was when Elia was killed.\nBorn and raised in Ashkelon, Elia was the youngest of four, attending local schools, including a religious high school. During his mandatory military service, Elia served in a number of logistical roles in the ground forces, according to a state eulogy.\nAfter his release, Elia worked in a number of fields, but always dreamed of exploring a career as a DJ. In 2023 he completed a DJ course at the Just Music academy and he began working professionally as DJ Illusion, advertising himself as available for parties and other events. He also loved to travel around the world, visiting many locales including Dubai, Vienna, Thailand, Turkey, Greece, Serbia, Singapore, Amsterdam and more.\nHe met Mor and their relationship developed, and in June 2021 their son Lavi was born. In an Instagram post marking Lavi’s 2nd birthday, Elia wrote that “you are the best thing I could ever ask for, and every moment with you is just light and joy,” wishing that “we will experience many more moments of laughter and happiness together.”\nMarking 11 months since he was killed, Mor wrote on Facebook that with each passing day, “the pain only grows stronger, the longing, your absence… I keep going to call you, to wish you a good week, and to ask you how Shabbat was.”\nMor wrote that “I know you are with us, I feel you right here with us, eating and traveling as always… We’ll do everything for you to be happy and so proud of us. For the whole world to know who you were! With the purest heart, the person who would always help and forgive others, always smile.”\nElia’s mother, Batsheva, told Maariv that “Elia was connected to music since he was born, he tried out many different industries but music was always burning inside him, whether at parties and concerts, he had DJ friends he would spend time with and he wanted to learn the profession.”\nIn his memory, she said, his family and friends sponsored a DJ course for at-risk youth, something they are certain Elia would have wanted.\nWhen he finished his studies, Batsheva said, “I told Elia that if he has the passion, he will accomplish his dream, and even if it was hard along the way he will overcome it and succeed… his dream had just started and was cut short.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Ido died immediately, but Aviel, who was shot in his abdomen, was still alive when three police officers found him.\nThey tried to keep him alive, but shortly afterward, a group of 12 terrorists showed up in a pickup truck and opened fire, killing both one of the police officers and Aviel.\nHe was buried on October 10 in the southern town of Merkaz Shapira. He is survived by his parents, Tamar and Benny, his brother, Omer, and three sisters, Mor, Reut and Tehilla.\nAviel was described by his friends and family as a friendly person who was full of joy and loved soccer. He was an avid fan of the Beitar Jerusalem soccer team and bonded with his nephew over their joint love of the sport and the team.\nThe fourth out of five children in the family, Aviel was raised in Merkaz Shapira, south of Kiryat Malachi. During his mandatory army service, Aviel served in the Combat Engineering Corps, stationed mostly in the Gaza envelope area.\nHis mother, Tamar, described Aviel to Channel 12 News as a “wonderful boy with a smile that would make you melt.”\n“From a very young age, I could never be mad at him. As a boy, he would give me such a huge hug. I would tell him, ‘You’re recharging me like a phone.’ He was an inexhaustible source of energy,” she said.\nOmer told Channel 12 that Aviel was his best friend as well as his brother.\n“We would spend a lot of time together. We would meet up at the end of every day, I finish work late, and Aviel would wait for me. We would sit and talk about everything,” he said.\nOmer added that Aviel wanted to “enjoy life.”\n“Friends were very important to him. He was a true friend, and he had a wide circle of friends of all ages. He would just connect with everyone. Even people who only met him for a short time remember him,” he said.\nAviel’s girlfriend, Tamar Golan, told Channel 12 that he had volunteered with Yedidim, an organization that helps drivers whose cars break down, because he wanted to do good.\n“He would see hitchhikers on the road, and I was always wary of picking them up, but he would say to me, ‘Tamari, we’re doing good, we’re helping people get home,'” she said.\n“This week, when I drove home from Aviel’s family, I saw hitchhikers. I’ve never stopped, but this time I did because it was Avieli’s mission. He just wanted to do good in the world, to help people and make them smile.

Avraham “Avi” Hovelashvili, 26, deputy commander of the Caracal Battalion, from Ashdod, was killed on October 7 while battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nWith the start of the attack, Avi was home in Ashdod with his wife and baby. When he started to hear reports of a Hamas invasion near Kibbutz Sufa, where his Caracal comrades were operating, Avi jumped into uniform and set off to join them, according to an IDF eulogy.\nOn his way, Avi encountered a cell of terrorists at the Sa’ad Junction not far from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, and together with two police officers they engaged in a firefight, killing several of them. Avi alerted authorities to the large amount of terrorists in the area, and continued southward to meet up with his comrades. On his way, Avi encountered another group of terrorists, not far from Re’im, and got out of his car to fight against them and was killed.\nHe was buried on October 11 in Ashdod. He is survived by his wife, Shoshi, their daughter Romi, 6 months, his parents, Simon and Rivka, and his brother, Daniel. Seven months after Avraham was killed, his son, Imri Avraham, was born.\nBorn and raised in Ashdod, Avi — who always stood out with his bright red hair — attended schools in the city, focusing his studies during high school on computers and physics. He loved soccer, particularly the Barcelona team, even flying overseas to watch them play with great excitement.\nAt age 17 he met Shoshi, when they worked together at the same events hall, and they felt an immediate “click,” later finding out that their mothers had been friends when they were toddlers.\nAvi enlisted in the IDF in November 2015, placed in the mixed-gender Caracal Battalion, serving along the Egyptian border. He completed a squad commanders course and later an officer’s course, serving in a number of commander positions over the years, including overseeing trainees and as a deputy company commander and later operations officer in a number of different battalions. Two weeks before he was killed, he took up the role of deputy commander of the Caracal Battalion, where he had got his start.\nAvi and Shoshi got married in a COVID-delayed ceremony in June 2021, and their daughter, Romi, was born in March 2023, just over six months before Avi was killed. About two weeks before October 7, the couple learned that Shoshi was pregnant with their second child. Avi — who never learned the gender of the baby — suggested that if it was a boy he would be called Imri. In May 2024, Imri Avraham Hovelashvili was born.\n“He was a person with a huge heart, and if he had a chance to save people he didn’t know, he would choose to do it every time,” Shoshi told a local news outlet, marking one year since Avi was killed.\nWhile she was giving birth, she said, “I felt that he was with me and watching over me at every moment. The midwives put a photo of him across from me with a sentence that he would always say to me: ‘My life, you’re a champion, it’s all easy for you, you can do anything’ — and that made it easier for me.”\nShoshi said she is worried about when the time comes that their children “will start to talk and will ask questions. But I hope that I will succeed in describing their father exactly as he was — a hero. That he loved them, that he will always be in our hearts and protecting us from above. And that they should be proud of him.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Master Sgt. (res.) Ido Kaslasi, 23, a soldier in the elite Maglan commando unit, from Kibbutz Harel, was killed battling Hamas terrorists near Zikim on October 11, 2023.\nAs soon as he understood what was happening on October 7, Ido gathered his gear and headed out to fight the Hamas terrorist invasion without waiting to be called up.\nHe was killed four days later outside Kibbutz Zikim, next to the border with Gaza, while protecting his team from an ambush by a group of Hamas terrorists. In doing so, he saved the lives of his team members and civilians. He was slain alongside his comrades Master Sgt. Daniel Kastiel and Master Sgt. Itay Moreno.\nIdo was buried on October 13 in Kibbutz Harel. He is survived by his parents, Kalanit and Eli, his brothers, Ayal and Uri and his girlfriend Maya.\nHe was born and raised in the kibbutz, outside Jerusalem, attending nearby schools. Always involved in local agriculture, he worked alongside his brothers in the produce fields, according to an IDF eulogy. Upon completing his military service in 2021, Ido returned to his love of working the land and participated in Kibbutz Harel’s agricultural projects. He also started a food truck with a childhood friend that served high-quality meat dishes.\nHe and his girlfriend, Maya, traveled together around South America and Europe, and when they returned to Israel, Ido was accepted to study agriculture at the Hebrew University’s campus in Rehovot and completed a course in using drones to help grow crops. He also continued to carry out regular reserve duty with Maglan.\nIdo’s friends, Nitzan and Guy, said at his funeral that he was “the smartest and funniest kid in the class.”\n“He was the best friend, the best soldier,” they added.\nAt Ido’s funeral, his mother, Calanit, said that he was “smart and funny, full of charisma and energy as well as sweetness and great sensitivity.”\n“Ido, my middle child, was the glue of the family — connecting, attentive, communicative and full of advice. He would light up and make noise everywhere he went. You couldn’t miss the energy he brought to a room,” she said.\nShe added that Ido “loved making food and feeding people. He was a meat expert and loved to host people at our patio in the kibbutz.”\nAyal said his brother had the “combination of sensitivity and roughness, an unending sense of humor and intelligence. He was restless, always doing things.”\nAt Ido’s funeral, Ayal said that even though he was the eldest child, Ido took on the role himself in many ways.\n“He protected me and Uri and took care of the whole family. Like every big brother, he did the job the best he could. I couldn’t ask for a better or more caring brother who spread light and joy everywhere,” he said.\nAyal added that it was never boring around Ido: “He always had something to say and somehow always found a way to laugh about every situation.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Supt. Dan Ganot, 41, a commander in the Israel Police’s coordination of enforcement operations unit, from Harish, was killed battling Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7.\nDan and eight other officers, along with a civilian, entered Be’eri together in two armored jeeps the morning of the Hamas attack, aiming to help rescue the besieged residents. They were ambushed almost immediately by Hamas gunmen, and all 10 of them were killed after RPG and later gunfire hit their vehicles. He was slain alongside Sgt. First Class Mulugeta Gadif, Sgt. 1st Class Dor Mangadi and Supt. Vadim Blih.\nDan’s body was only able to be identified a week later, and he was buried on October 15 in Zichron Yaakov. He is survived by his daughters, Annabel and Shila, his parents, Yehuda and Racheli Efrat, and his brothers Ofir and Gilad.\nIn a video made to memorialize Dan, his friends and family said he loved music, surfing and bike rides.\nAfter finishing his military service, Dan spent a few years in the Caribbean. When he returned to Israel, he joined the Israel Police where he advanced as far as he could before starting officer training. Before serving in his final position, Dan was the commander of police stations in Or Akiva and Hadera.\nDan was a big fan of the Maccabi Haifa soccer club, which published a memorial page for him, and he attended many of their games with his brother Ofir.\nHis mother, Racheli Efrat, told the club that “Dan was a hero in life and not just in Be’eri.”\n“He got youth away from drugs and crime. After 14-hour shifts, he would go and play with at-risk youth and would clean up beaches with them as part of educational programs,” she said, adding he “wouldn’t want us to remember him as a fighter and a hero, but as a person who worked to help young people.”\nAfter Dan’s death, Or Akiva Municipality’s youth department head, Shani Rabi, told Racheli Efrat, “Dan did here what nobody else could do, and he gave our youth hope. As a police commander, he didn’t have to do it, but he was full of morals and made other police officers come and spend time with the youth and teach them a different way.”\nAt a memorial ceremony for him in Or Akiva in February, his mother added, “Dan instilled in us that anything is possible, that we can learn the language of unity, love, friendship, and togetherness.”\nBrother Ofir said, “Dan was a patriot from birth who loved helping everyone and was always the first one wherever help was needed.”\n“Dan left behind a clear and pure legacy of Zionism, love for his country, and dedication, which we will hold in our hearts and hand down in his name to future generations forever,” said his friend, Ori, at a memorial ceremony.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 199 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Eliyahu Yaakov Berenshtein, 19, from Jerusalem, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while trying to flee the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHe attended the rave with a group of friends, and when the rocket fire began he and his friend Avraham Neriya Cohen, an off-duty IDF soldier, fled via car and were ambushed and shot dead along the highway by a cell of Hamas terrorists. Eliyahu was considered missing for a week until his body was located and identified.\nEliyahu, who was deeply artistic and involved in music, was part of the festival production team — his very last Instagram post was in late September, hyping the Supernova festival and its “lineup with a variety of artists from the best labels,” which he wrote would guarantee “a night of psychedelia and sounds that won’t give you a moment’s rest.”\nEliyahu was buried in Jerusalem on October 15. He is survived by his parents, Hadassah and Avida, and his nine younger siblings.\nEliyahu grew up in a Haredi family who lived first in Tel Aviv and then later in Jerusalem, but already in his early teens he rebelled against the path that was expected of him, and sought a different lifestyle. His family thought the move to Jerusalem when he was in 8th grade would help, they said, but there was no stopping Eliyahu from seeking his own path.\nHe was talented in music and art, and in the last years of his life he greatly explored his musical passions, teaching himself how to use editing software and working in the electronic music world.\nHis father, Avida, told the Makor Rishon newspaper — in an article about Haredi parents whose children were killed at Supernova — that after a difficult period following his dropping out of yeshiva, Eliyahu began working at a restaurant at age 16. He “had a strong work ethic and he was a very easygoing person. People saw him as a lighthouse, a symbol of honesty and purity. They said he was like a candle to them. Even in a not-so-good environment, he stood out for his purity.”\nLater, Avida said, Eliyahu worked in the Mahane Yehuda market, “where he met many young people who, like him, ‘were looking for meaning in life.’ He always supported them and told them not to fight with their families.” At another point, he said, Eliyahu worked on the production team of the “Big Brother” TV show.\nEliyahu’s aunt, Noa Li-at Tzor, wrote on Facebook that he was “her first nephew, a sweet and smiley baby chick who lit up and gladdened our hearts.”\nHe was “a child of peace,” she added. “You accepted everyone as equals — all people with no exceptions. You weren’t a big talker, you would mostly listen. God knows how much I would badger you, and only if you had something important and relevant to say would you say it, and even that in your characteristic bashful manner.”\n“You followed your passions and invested so much in them in the most dedicated way, and everything you taught to yourself,” she said. “You were a wellspring of talent, you were so modest, but you had so much to be proud of… you had a rich inner world of melodies, tunes and paintings that told your story, and left behind for us a testimony of your magical soul.”\nHis mother, Hadassah, told a religious website that “since he was born, he was very special and gifted with many talents. He could identify letters and numbers already from 18 months old, and only when we had more kids did we realize how unusual that was. He was a gentle boy, gifted, a combination of purity and talent, a kid who never hurt a fly.”\nHadassah said, “Eliyahu didn’t deal with external appearances at all, he was a real person, he was the one who taught us to look inside and not at the shell, at the Jewish soul inside everyone. In that respect, you could say that Eliyahu taught us, his parents, how to look at life.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "David Yair Shalom Newman, 25, from Jerusalem, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nDavid attended the rave with his girlfriend, Noam Ben David. When the rocket fire began, they ran for their car but decided to head to a less packed area to wait out the heavy exiting traffic. When they realized that terrorists had invaded the festival, Noam and David ran and sought shelter in a large metal dumpster near the site of the rave.\nThe terrorists realized that a group had gathered there, and opened fire on those inside, killing David and wounding Noam, who was later rescued and survived. “I heard David’s last breath next to me but I was too scared to move,” she recounted.\nMany others were killed inside the dumpster, including Maya Bitton, and her fiance, Eliran Mizrahi, Inbar Shem Tov, Hadar Prince, Ilkin Nazarov and Amit Levy.\nDavid was buried in Jerusalem on October 10. He is survived by his father, Moshe Meir, and his four siblings, Batya, Noah, Gavriel and Dvir.\nThe fourth child in his family, David grew up in the Old City of Jerusalem, studying in ultra-Orthodox schools, including the Yerushalayim Torah Academy. In 2016, when he was finishing up high school, his mother, Chaya, died, dealing a heavy blow to the family, according to a state eulogy. Though David left behind the religious lifestyle he grew up with, he remained close to his family and was a doting uncle to his nieces and nephews.\nIn October 2017, David enlisted in the IDF, officially classified as a lone soldier, and was placed as a driver in the Air Force, but fought until he was accepted to a combat role with the Golani Brigade. Following his release, he worked as a waiter at the Kedma restaurant in Jerusalem to save up for his travels, later spending eight months touring South America.\nUpon his return, David moved to Herzliya and started working at an events hall in the city, already planning to save up for his next trip abroad — this time to India. In the meantime, he met Noam, and the pair quickly became a couple and ended up traveling through India together. David returned to Israel in June 2023, returning to work in the events industry and planning to one day open and run his own events hall. At the same time, he also dedicated himself to physical fitness and had even trained to become a personal trainer.\nHis girlfriend, Noam, told a local news outlet that the couple had plans to move in together the day after the festival, after being together for a year and a half. Her physical recovery from her gunshot wounds “is the easy part compared to dealing with my psychological pain, the huge hole in my heart, the enormous loss of the love of my life. We were now supposed to be celebrating a month living in our shared apartment in Yaffo, and instead, I’m in the hospital, learning to walk again.”\nNoam said that David was “the most incredible and beautiful person in the world, who was always smiling, helping, supporting and loving… He always supported me and told me I was a lioness who could do anything, and now he’s not here anymore.” She said that instead of her family “being at my wedding and celebrating and dancing, they are crying with me at my boyfriend’s funeral.”\nDavid’s younger brother, Dvir, wrote on a memorial page that his older brother “was and always has been a hero to me, was and always has been light to me.”\n“You were everything to me, a big brother, a friend, a partner a role model — you were an angel in human form,” he added. “You were the biggest gift in this life, and you always will be. Thank you, rest in peace my brother, my love, my blood, my king, my angel.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Barak Ben David, 19, a Golani Brigade soldier, from Dimona, was killed on October 7 while battling the Hamas invasion of the Nahal Oz IDF outpost.\nWith the start of the rocket fire, Barak and most of those on base headed for the bomb shelter. When they realized that the attack was more than just rockets, they were told to go back to their rooms and suit up in full combat gear. In an ensuing gun battle with a cell of terrorists, Barak was seriously wounded, and his comrades Staff Sgt. Nehoray Amitay and Staff Sgt. Sahar Meidani dragged him to the bomb shelter to try and save him.\nBarak ultimately bled out of his wounds after several hours without any medics able to help. Nehoray and Sahar were both later killed in battle when Hamas gunmen continued to attack those inside the bomb shelter with gunfire and grenades. In all, 52 soldiers — including Barak’s close friends Staff Sgt. Ori Karmi and Staff Sgt. Adir Bogale — were killed and 10 soldiers were kidnapped from the Nahal Oz base that day.\nA month later, Barak’s close childhood friend, Staff Sgt. Noam Yosef Abou, was killed while fighting in Gaza.\nBarak was buried on October 12 in Dimona. He is survived by his parents, Shira and Avinoam, and his siblings Shaked, Roi and Omri.\nBorn and raised in Dimona, his family described him as quiet, modest and humble, a person who loved plants and flowers and put a lot of effort into tending his home’s garden. He also loved children and was always happy to spend time entertaining them, they said.\nBarak dreamed of and fought to enlist in the Golani Brigade, his family said, in order to follow in his father’s footsteps. Barak was even named for the 12th battalion in which his father served. Ultimately he enlisted in March 2022 and after pushing for it was placed in Golani’s 13th battalion.\nOn a memorial Instagram page, his loved ones described how Barak “fought tooth and nail to get to Golani, even though they didn’t want you to, you went to the induction center with your bag ready, you fought to accomplish your goal of being a Golani fighter like your father… You were the happiest person on the day of your final basic training trek, with the brown beret on your head… you were so happy and proud of yourself.”\nHis sister, Shaked, told Channel 12 news that “Barak was a very unique boy. In the family we all called him ‘everyone’s big heart.’ He was always around children and loved them a lot, he was always free to help, no matter what time, to show up, to help, to assist, to his family, his friends. He was just all good, and his loss is very felt.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Shani Amin, 18, from Ashdod, was murdered by Hamas terrorists after fleeing the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nShe attended the rave with her boyfriend, Adam Ilaev, and when the rocket fire began, they were among the first to flee the festival and made it safely to Beersheba, where they were supposed to meet up with a friend. But when they weren’t able to reach that friend — who was himself hiding from the terror attack at the rave — they decided instead to head home to Ashdod.\nWithout understanding the intensity of the attack, they were traveling near Sderot along Route 232 when they saw what they thought were IDF soldiers. But they were actually Hamas terrorists, who opened fire on their car, killing Adam and seriously wounding Shani, who managed to call her grandfather before she ultimately died of her wounds. Her body was not identified for more than 10 days.\nShani was buried in Ashdod on October 17, alongside Adam, who had been buried several days earlier. She is survived by her parents, Nir and Merav, and her siblings Idan, Shira and Tahel.\nThe second oldest of her siblings, Shani was described by her family as being optimistic and full of joy and loving music and dancing, according to a municipal eulogy. She would choreograph dances for her friends and classmates, they said, and always loved to perform.\nAt age 17 she met Adam on the beach and they quickly became a couple, and they were planning a trip together to Amsterdam that they never got to take. Shani had recently finished high school and was slated to soon enlist in the army when she was killed. Shortly after her 18th birthday in April 2023, she got a tattoo with the lyrics, “Here comes the sun” on her back.\nShe was particularly close with her grandfather, Ami Kalfon, who said at a ceremony marking a year since she was murdered that “every day I want to write to you, to speak to you, to hear you and to embrace you… You were always so present, and I can’t go on without you. You are the air and the joy and the light everywhere you went — and suddenly you are no longer.”\nA memorial Instagram page described Shani as “a strong, powerful, opinionated, beautiful and different woman.”\n“When she loves you, she loves you all the way, there’s no way out of her heart — you’re stuck there,” the post reads. “She’s a warrior for justice, she was born to this world to make things right and to show what true joy is, what is a hug that leaves marks on your body and what is contagious laughter that rings in your ears for weeks.”\n“She left this world to make us appreciate those things,” it added. “She shone everywhere she went and you couldn’t miss her. It’s like she did it on purpose, to tell us, ‘Look at me, this is me, I’m here, but not for very long.'”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Or Malka, 21, a COGAT soldier from Acre, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nHe was stationed on base next to the Erez Crossing that morning, and with the start of the rocket fire entered the on-base bomb shelter, where he video called his girlfriend to tell her what was going on. Not long afterward, Sgt. Emil Samoylov, who had been stationed on guard at the gate, entered the bomb shelter already wounded from a firefight by the Hamas gunmen who had stormed across the crossing point into Israel.\nOr, Emil and Cpl. Lidor Mekayes were slain when the Hamas invaders attacked the shelter. Cpl. Nik Beizer and Sgt. Ron Sherman were kidnapped and later killed in Gaza, their bodies recovered by IDF troops, while Tamir Nimrodi, a soldier who was taken captive with Nik and Ron, is believed to still be held hostage in Gaza.\nOr was buried on October 13 in Nahariya. He is survived by his parents, Dganit and Yosef, his siblings Idan, Gal and Aviv, and his girlfriend, Shay Lee.\nBorn and raised in Acre, Or was the youngest in the family, after three older brothers, all of whom had a big impact on his life, according to an Acre municipal obituary. As a kid he was a bit of a prankster, especially during his “dumb teenage years,” according to his loved ones, and took great care in his appearance, always seeking out the new popular attire and accessories.\nWhen Or met his girlfriend, Shay Lee Eno, he changed a lot of his behaviors, his parents said, becoming more considerate, more concerned with being financially independent and ultimately moving in with her family and working with them.\nHe enlisted in the IDF in February 2022 and served as a cook at the base next to the Erez Crossing. His family wrote that “Or really enjoyed being a cook on base, he loved to pamper the combat support soldiers and everyone on base, when he would come home he’d show off his skills with the schnitzels he would make for them and for us.”\nOr’s military schedule had him spending a week on base and a week off, and during the off periods he worked with Shay Lee’s mother in her daycare center, “changing diapers, hugging, stroking, educating and being sensitive to the toddlers.”\nHis girlfriend, Shay Lee, told Maariv that the pair met when she was just 13, and he ended up moving in with her family after she turned 14.\n“Or was a good soul, just an angel,” she said. “He worked with me and my mom at daycare, he had a connection to every person. Everywhere he went he would spread his light. He always made sure things were good for everyone, that there was never anything lacking at home or in our relationship.”\nShay Lee added that Or “always made sure I was OK, that I wouldn’t worry. That’s what he also did in his final moments, tried to calm me down and said, ‘Don’t worry, everything’s OK.'”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 205 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Sgt. First Class Mulugeta “Mulu” Gadif, 29, a police officer in the coordination of enforcement operations unit, from Kiryat Gat, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Be’eri.\nWith the start of the attack, Mulugeta was home with his family, and knew he would be called up to the front lines. He headed out to meet up with his team, and they went in the direction of Sderot before being told to head to Kibbutz Be’eri.\nNine police officers and a civilian — Ziv Shopen — entered Be’eri together in two armored jeeps, and almost immediately were ambushed by Hamas gunmen who fired RPGs at them and opened fire. Mulu, Ziv and seven other police officers were killed, including Sgt. 1st Class Dor Mangadi and Supt. Vadim Blih.\nAmid the chaos in Be’eri and the heavy damage caused by the RPGs, Mulu’s body was not identified for a week. He was buried on October 16 in Kiryat Gat.\nHe is survived by his wife, Tali, their baby, Elia, his parents, Belaynesh (Sara) and Adana, and his younger siblings Malasa, Terualem (Rivka) and Temesgen.\nThe oldest in the family, Mulu was born in Gondar, Ethiopia. He attended local schools, loved to write, draw and crochet kippot, and was a successful athlete in both soccer and gymnastics, according to a state eulogy.\nIn 2007, when Mulu was 12, his family moved to Israel and lived in an absorption center in Beersheba, while he attended a dormitory school in Jerusalem. In 2009, his mother was in a bad car accident and was hospitalized for more than a year, during which Mulu diligently visited every day and slept by her bedside, continuing to care for her devotedly in the years afterward.\nAfter graduating high school, Mulu attended the Oz Shlomo pre-military academy in Merkaz Shapira, and then enlisted in the IDF, serving as a sharpshooter in the Duvdevan commando unit. Toward the end of his service, he met Tali, and the couple got engaged in 2021 and married a year later. Their daughter, Elia, was born in May 2023. The couple had bought an apartment in Holon and were waiting for it to be refurbished before moving in.\nFollowing his release from the army, Mulu worked as a security guard and in the evenings he established a local soccer team for youth in Kiryat Gat. In March 2023, he fulfilled his dream of enlisting in the Israel Police.\nTali told a local news site that the couple had so many plans for the future that were cut short: “We didn’t get to move into our new apartment, Mulu barely got to know his daughter, or to do what we planned to accomplish together.”\nEven though their daughter knew her father for just five months, “she is aware that he is missing. He would come home every day from work and talk to her, laugh with her, she knew his voice. Every time anyone knocks on the door and she looks that way, when she sees that it’s not him she is sad.” Tali said that the little comfort she has, “is that Mulu died as he wanted, as a hero, as a leader who did everything he could to save others.”\nHis mother, Belaynesh (Sara), wrote on Facebook that she gave birth to Mulu, her firstborn, when she was 14, “and for 29 years I was so happy with him and my husband and my children.”\nHe was a doting older brother to his younger siblings, she said, “Mulu for me was everything, my whole world… he was such a brave and talented boy.” While she was recovering from her accident, Mulu “took care of me and treated me and did everything to strengthen me… the whole time I hoped and prayed for Mulu that he would be happy, and that everything he did would succeed.”\n“The connection between Mulu and me was unique, we were really like good friends, we would talk about everything, things that only knew,” she continued. “I want everyone to know, all the people of Israel, that he fell in order to protect the State of Israel and its citizens so that we can live here in peace and love and brotherhood.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Omri “Omrikey” Ahrak, 26, from Elyakhin, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while trying to flee the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nOmri attended the rave with a group of four friends — two of his army buddies and their girlfriends — and with the start of the rocket fire they decided to leave the site of the party and head home. They were ambushed by a cell of Hamas terrorists and Omri was slain alongside Danielle Waldman, Noam Shai and Shahar Gindi. Almog Sarusi was kidnapped and slain in Gaza almost a year later, his body recovered by IDF troops.\nHis family searched for any sign of him for five days, including heading to the site of the rave in order to look for his body or any sign of life, but came up empty handed. Finally they were informed by authorities that Omri’s body had been found.\nHe was buried on October 12 in Elyakhin. He is survived by his parents, Raya and Zephaniah, and his siblings Gal and Meital.\nBorn and raised in the small Moshav Elyakhin near Hadera, he attended schools in the nearby Kibbutz Givat Haim and Kfar Monash. He was active and sporty, working out regularly and playing footvolley, as well as being a devoted fan of the Maccabi Haifa soccer team, according to a state eulogy.\nHe was also very musically involved, playing the guitar and singing with friends. He wrote and composed his own music in recent years, and dreamed of turning the hobby into a profession. In his memory, his loved ones started “Omrikey jam sessions” to gather his friends around song.\nAfter high school, Omri enlisted in the IDF and served in the Givati Brigade’s Orev battalion. After his release, he embarked on a long trip around South America with friends, and upon his return started working as a security guard and studied coding with the Infinity Labs hi-tech training program.\nHe had been working for just two weeks at a company in Tel Aviv when he was killed. He had also been planning to get certified as a personal trainer.\nHis father, Zephaniah, told a local news outlet that “Omri was a kid with a huge appetite for life. He served in the army in a significant role in Givati, after that took his ‘big trip’ abroad like everyone, returned and started studying computers and building his life. Just two weeks ago he found work at a company in Tel Aviv where they embraced him. He was a kid who you couldn’t help loving, always with a smile, always polite, always aware of others — even if he was in an emotional storm, he’d always find the time to look at you and say, ‘Good morning, how are you?'”\nHis father added, “Omri was 26 years and 24 days old — that’s all God gave us to have with his incredible boy. He was extremely competitive, loved people. The number of friends he managed to connect to was nuts. He was always in the middle, his smile, his personality, the silliness he did that made everyone smile drew people toward him.”\nHe said that Omri “really loved music, knew how to play well and had an incredible voice, he would sing ‘Hava Nagila’ and people would cry, he had a voice filled with pain. He was another kind of soul.”\nHis mother, Raya, told Israel Hayom that Omri “was the glue of all his friends, a boy of love who embraced and was embraced and was always in the middle. He loved the sea, he loved playing sports with his friends, especially footvolley — especially because you could include people of any age.”\nIn his memory, she said, the family is raising funds to build a footvolley field in their hometown, “and to make his dream come true.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Amitai Yaakov Ben Zvi, 80, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in his home on October 7.\nWith the start of the attack, Amitai and his Filipino caregiver, Jimmy Pacheco, entered the home’s reinforced room. Hamas terrorists stormed the room, murdering Amitai and taking Jimmy captive to Gaza.\nJimmy — who had been living with and caring for Amitai since 2019 — was freed from captivity on November 24, 2023, as part of a weeklong truce and hostage deal.\nAfter he was released, Jimmy met with Amitai’s family and told them that in his final moments, “Dad told me to tell you that he loves you and shouted at me, ‘Go, run, save yourself.’ I’m so sorry I couldn’t save him.”\nHis funeral was held in Kibbutz Lahav on October 22. He is survived by his five children, Avishay, Hagar, Ido, Gilad and Orna, 10 grandchildren and his younger brother, Mati. His wife, Miri, died in 2016.\nThe oldest of his three siblings, Amitai was born in New York while his parents were living there as emissaries from the Hashomer Hatzair Zionist organization, according to a state eulogy. When he was 3, his family returned to Israel, settling in Kibbutz Ein Hashofet near Haifa, where Amitai grew up.\nHe did his mandatory army service in the Paratroopers Brigade, and afterward returned to Ein Hashofet where he met his wife, Miri, who arrived there with a youth pioneer group. The couple married in 1972 and moved to Nir Oz next to Gaza, where they remained for the rest of their lives.\nAmitai served in reserve duty in the Sinai during the Yom Kippur War, rushing home in the middle after his firstborn son was born — an act the family attributed to saving his life, as many of his comrades were killed in the ensuing battles. He worked as a professional truck driver for many years on a number of different routes and transports around the country.\nShortly before his 60th birthday, Amitai was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, which greatly affected his mobility, and ultimately led the family to employ Jimmy. Amitai loved classical music and had a large record collection, and after he could no longer drive trucks his family bought him a model train set, which he greatly expanded and attended to over the years.\nA eulogy from Kibbutz Nir Oz said the name Amitai immediately brought to mind “your wide-brimmed had, your measured and slow walk, you building an electric train for a long time, and mostly — driving,” noting his years of working as a truck driver. “You were addicted to the steering wheel, the vehicle, the truck accessories and the rides themselves. A driver in every limb of your being.”\nAmitai’s son, Avishay, wrote on Facebook that his father “was always very reserved and didn’t express much emotion,” attributing it to growing up in the time of communal sleeping wards for kibbutz children. “Even when his mother died in 1982, I don’t remember that I saw him crying or expressing emotions, except sometimes anger or frustration. Later, when my mother died of cancer in 2016, he softened a lot. And still, I always imagine him looking at things in a practical way — practical, not emotional.”\n“I’m sad,” he added. “His life shouldn’t have ended this way. After he survived wars and a difficult disease. If he had died in his sleep, we would have been sad but come to terms more easily with death. But he had a full life, he raised a family, children, grandchildren, and he was able to live his life in his chosen way.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 208 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

He and his team had worked until 2 a.m. that Saturday before going to rest in Ashkelon, according to a state eulogy. At 6 a.m. they were called back to the site of the rave to fix something, and not long after the Hamas attack began.\nHe and his crew hid underneath the stage of the festival for several hours, and Dror texted his family asking them to direct help there. That was the last they heard from him. Dror and three of his employees, Shoval Yaakov, Oded Abergel and Avidan Torgeman, were all murdered at the site of the festival.\nDror was buried on October 11 in Kibbutz Beit Alfa in the north. He is survived by his parents, Ella and Idan, and his younger siblings Adi, Ziv and Gil.\nBorn and raised in Beit Alfa, a fourth generation on the kibbutz, Dror was active and sporty, and as a kid he learned how to ride a unicycle, even taking part in overseas competitions, his loved ones said. When he was 15 his family moved to Lagos, Nigeria, for two years, where he attended an international school.\nHe finished high school in Israel and enlisted in the IDF, serving as a mechanic in the Israeli Air Force. After his release, he traveled to India for an extended period, and when he returned to Israel he adopted his beloved dog, Rider, who accompanied him on all trips around the country moving forward. Dror worked for several years as a solar panel installer before starting his own festival design company and moved to Kibbutz Sde Nahum near his hometown.\nHe and Rider were rarely apart during the six years they were together, and after Dror’s death, his family said the dog has been inconsolable.\n“My Drorik, the love of my life, you gave me the title ‘Mom’ for the first time,” his mother, Ella, wrote in a eulogy. “You taught me love that the heart cannot contain. You taught me so many feelings and mixed emotions, difficulty, frustration, joy, pride, endless worry. And now the pain of loss that the heart cannot contain. You gave me the cursed title of bereaved mother.”\n“You traveled around the world as a free spirit… You always walked your own unique path without worrying about what others thought,” she added. “With everywhere you went and every person you met, you always knew how to touch the right spot, to say the right thing that will light up someone’s day. Children, the elderly, those with special needs — everyone as they are.”\nDror’s father, Idan, wrote in a eulogy that his son “took the world by storm. You knew how to live. You knew how to enjoy what there was and to exhaust it to the fullest. You spread warmth, love, opinions, kindness and generosity all over — as if you had an endless supply.”\nIdan said Dror “managed in 30 years what people don’t manage in a full life. I wanted you to go study, to learn a profession, to work, advance, develop a career — but you had a different direction. Not that. Not the norm. Not the recognized and known and safe.

    "story": "Sgt. Roei Peri, 19, a Golani Brigade soldier from Shoham, was killed on October 7 while battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nRoei was stationed at the Paga IDF outpost near the Gaza border when the attack began. He and the others on base ran to the bomb shelter and soon realized that the base was being invaded by Hamas gunmen. Roei and a group of others decided to head to the gate of the outpost to fend off the attack, according to an IDF eulogy.\nAmid the fierce battles, their commander, Cpt. Dekel Suissa, decided to send most of them back to the bomb shelter, but Roei volunteered to stay on. He and Dekel were both slain while battling the Hamas gunmen at the entrance to the base. Ultimately, 14 soldiers out of the 25 from Golani’s 13th battalion stationed at the outpost that day were killed in the attack, including Staff Sgt. Shalev Baranes, Staff Sgt. Itay Glisko and Staff Sgt. Itamar Ben Yehuda.\nRoei was buried near Shoham on October 11. He is survived by his parents, Ronit and Ofer, his older brother Ido and his twin Itay.\nBorn and raised in Shoham, his loved ones described him as being serious and responsible but able to meet any challenge with an optimistic outlook. As a kid he was involved in a wide variety of sports, including tennis, karate, soccer and swimming. He was also very musical, played the drums, saxophone and flute and loved to sing and dance.\nThroughout high school, he took part in a physical training program aimed at preparing himself for a combat role in the IDF. He enlisted in December 2022 and was stationed at the Paga outpost just a few months before he was killed.\nRoei’s girlfriend of two years, Noyel, wrote on Instagram two months after he was killed: “I still don’t understand what happened and I’m far from internalizing that you won’t ever come back.”\n“I make my bed and imagine you jumping on it a second later, I make food you loved and send you a picture, maybe you’ll come visit,” she added. “I try to imagine if you were wounded how I would sleep in the hospital bed with you and stay with you forever.”\n“Why? Why you? Why did you volunteer? Why did you leave me here alone?” Noyel asked. “And then I remember your personality. You didn’t think of yourself. You wanted to save the situation. You are my hero and you will be for my entire life.”\nHis mother, Ronit, wrote on Instagram that while many people say time heals all wounds, “time is not healing, the opposite, every day your absence is even harder.”\n“Every weekend time stands still and my heart explodes with pain and longing,” she continued. “I’m waiting for you to call in order to pick you up and bring you home, I’m waiting to wash your uniform, your clothes, workout clothes, your bag. I’m waiting to iron for you, to make those cookies you and your friends like to bring to base on Sunday.”\n“I miss the unique moments you had with Ido and Itay that were just yours. I miss you coming with me spontaneously to so many places, sitting with coffee and dessert or breakfast and then going to buy all sorts of stuff you needed for the army,” Ronit continued. “Roeikush — I remember that I have Dad and Itay and Ido and that life goes on, and I remember that I need to be strong and — believe me — I’m strong, but it’s so hard, and my heart hurts so much.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Oren Stern, 49, from Netiv Ha’asara, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the town near Gaza.\nAs a member of the community’s local security squad, he was posthumously recognized as a fallen soldier with the rank of major in the reserves.\nOren set out that morning with his friend and neighbor, Danny Vovk, to fend off the Hamas attack. The pair fought — outnumbered and outarmed — against the invaders until they were both killed.\nOren’s body was not identified for more than 10 days. His funeral was held in Ge’a on October 19, and he was buried in Netiv Ha’asara. He is survived by his parents, Tova and Moshe, and his brother Eyal.\nBorn and raised in Moshav Ge’a near Ashkelon, Oren worked for the Rav Bariach lock company, and was a well-known and active community member in Netiv Ha’asara. He loved to surf and play basketball, even tried his hand at kayaking and skiing, and was a doting uncle to his nieces and nephews. During his military service, he served as a combat engineer and later studied engineering at the Sapir Academic College in Sderot.\nHis childhood friend, Keren Madmoni, wrote on Facebook of their memories together in high school, where “you were the Ashkenazi hottie, a gentleman on the one hand, intelligent, wise” who pursued the hardest track in every class “without any effort… and on the other hand a prankster, who ran with the rough and tough and funny crowd.”\n“You were beautiful both inside and out, taking care of everyone, if they’d get in fights you were always there to back them up,” she added. “Always supporting and cheering on — you’d go to Zikim with your tractors. Wow, how much nonsense you got up to, how much basketball you played, how many trips you went on, how many injuries, and thankfully they were moderate.”\n“You were different from me,” Keren added, “quiet, noble, modest, I appreciated you for your concern, your integrity, your diligence, your realness — you were never about impressing anyone.”\nHis sister-in-law, Mali, wrote on Facebook that “it’s not logical, it simply can’t be that we won’t see you again. You were so filled with only good, full of endless generosity, a man who didn’t know how to say no!”\n“A good man, modest, the salt of the earth with an eternal bashful smile,” she continued. “I want to thank you for who you were to Eyal, to my children, to me — the beloved uncle, the funny guy who was always caring and present, and also in your death you cared for others and not yourself.”\n“You and Danny saved the neighborhood, you were always together, even in your bitter death,” she added. “You will be missed in every moment of our lives… You’ll stay forever in our hearts and we will always talk and speak about you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 211 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

Amit Most, 20, a paramedic in the Nahal Brigade’s elite reconnaissance unit, from Modiin, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the Sufa IDF outpost.\nAmit spent the weekend on base, and with the start of the rocket fire headed for the bomb shelter. Upon learning of the infiltrating terrorists, Amit and Staff Sgt. Ofir Melman headed out to defend the outpost and treat the wounded. They managed to rescue a number of wounded soldiers before both Amit and Ofir were killed, along with 11 others on base, including Staff Sgt. Gali Shakotai and Sgt. Nahman Dekel.\nAmit was buried on October 11 in Modiin. He is survived by his parents, Hagit and Ehud, and his siblings Yaron and Michal.\nBorn and raised in Modiin, Amit loved music and reading, and volunteered with the Krembo Wings organization for children with special needs. He loved the city of London, and dreamed of one day getting a degree in psychology there, his family said.\nIn December 2021 he enlisted in the IDF, and was accepted into the Orev company in the Nahal Brigade’s special reconnaissance unit, where he trained as a paramedic, serving first as a team medic and later as a company medic.\nHis girlfriend of three years, Adar Moshaof, told Ynet that they met when she was 16 and Amit was 17 — and realized they shared the same birthday.\n“Two weeks later we were a couple, everything came easily, we got along incredibly,” she said. “We dreamed of flying together to study in London — he would learn psychology and I would study interior design — we imagined the little apartment we’d live in. Three months after Amit was killed I flew to London with his family and extinguished the dream.”\nAdar said she would get flowers from Amit every Friday, and they would manage to stay in touch even when he didn’t have access to his phone: “When we enlisted, we decided on a few [shared] emojis, the octopus represented ‘I love you.’ When he didn’t have his phone, Amit would take random people’s phones and send me an octopus.”\nAmit’s sister, Michal, wrote on Instagram, “I miss you so much, it’s crazy how much your absence is felt in every moment in the day — I want to slap myself for taking the time we had together for granted.”\n“I can’t believe that just a week ago I was in London and you were home with the first [army sick days] you took in your life and we spoke on WhatsApp and I bought you the record you’d wanted for a long time — and now it’s in your room on the shelf and still in its packaging,” she wrote.\n“I miss our conversations and our jokes, your dumb things, driving with you in the car. I miss the way you made people feel because you were such a special person,” added Michal. “I think you knew how much I loved and admired you, and I hope we will meet again.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Assaf Febvre, 23, was murdered by Hamas terrorists near his home in Kibbutz Re’im on October 7.\nAssaf was at home in an apartment in the youth wing of the kibbutz when the attack began. He called up a member of the local security team and asked if they had a weapon he could use to join the fight against the Hamas invasion. There were none to spare, but nevertheless Assaf chose to try and fight them off face-to-face, his family said, succeeded twice in escaping their attempts to kidnap him before he was shot and killed.\nAlso in the kibbutz’s youth wing that day, Amit Gabay was murdered while Liam Or was kidnapped and later freed. Assaf’s parents and sisters huddled in their own safe room in the kibbutz, escaping out of the window after terrorists set their house on fire, and ultimately being rescued by security forces. The next morning, they were told that Assaf’s body had been found on the grass near the kibbutz factory.\nAssaf was buried on October 17 in Kibbutz Re’im. He is survived by his parents, Rotem and Geo, and his older sisters Lia and Noam.\nThe baby of the family, Assaf was born in Re’im, to Rotem, a native of the kibbutz, and Geo, a native of Vietnam who had been orphaned as a baby during the war and adopted by a French woman who raised him in Paris, according to a fundraising page. Geo came to the kibbutz as a volunteer and met Rotem, ultimately settling there and raising their family.\nAssaf wasn’t much of a dedicated student, according to a state eulogy, but his true love was music, learning to play guitar at age 10 and starting a band with his friends in high school. Most of the photos and videos of Assaf shared by loved ones after his death showed him strumming on his beloved guitar.\nDuring his time in the army, Assaf served in the Combat Engineering Corps, and after his release he took a security course and worked as a guard on El Al flights, and later as security on cruise ships.\nHe also pursued a wide range of interests, including completing an underwater diving course, getting his motorcycle license and visiting Thailand. He was dedicated to exercising and keeping in shape and loved extreme sports, taking ski vacations and planning to try parachuting on his next trip abroad.\n“Assaf was a leader who gave a shoulder, advice, a sense of security, who gave you a lot, personally and socially,” Geo wrote on Facebook about his son, a month after he was killed. “It fills me with happiness, strengthens me. I have no doubt that while Assaf was fighting terrorists, he saved part of the kibbutz. So let’s win together for him, for us, for the next generation.”\n“I had a lot of love to give to Assaf and it’s over, I am ready to give you all the love I have left,” he added. “At 3 in the morning on Sunday, October 8, I wrote to Assaf: ‘I love you.’ I don’t think I ever told him out loud. Out loud I want to say: ‘I love you.'”\nHis older sister, Noam, wrote on Facebook: “Assafi, I don’t want to wake up in the morning to a world you’re not in.”\n“Assafi, you’re the most talented, handsome, strong, successful and good kid there was and will be in this world,” she continued. “You really had hands of gold and a golden heart. I can’t describe how talented you are, and those who know you understand. You’re the best friend, the best brother, the best son, the best to everyone.”\nNoam added that “I was privileged to be your big sister, your number one fan. From the day you were born you were my heart, my greatest love and you always will be.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

When the rocket fire began, Dima decided to wait it out, but around 7:50 he chose to try and get home regardless, according to a state eulogy.

Yoad was slain alongside his friend Aner Shapira, while another friend, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, was abducted to Gaza and murdered in captivity close to a year later.\nWhen the rocket fire began, Yoad, Aner, Hersh and Adi Kaufman left the site of the festival via car, and the four of them stopped to seek safety in a roadside bomb shelter near Kibbutz Re’im.\nOf the 27 people who holed up inside that roadside bomb shelter, only seven were rescued alive, while 16 were murdered and four kidnapped. Yoad was slain along with many others when the terrorists threw grenades inside the shelter and opened fire on those huddled inside.\nHe was buried in Nes Harim on October 10. He is survived by his parents, Tali and David, sister Shahar and brother Yotam.\nBorn and raised in Jerusalem, he attended schools in the city and was always surrounded by friends, according to a state eulogy. He loved good food and travel both inside and outside Israel, and got to live one of his dreams of seeing the northern lights in Lapland, Finland, and riding a snowmobile there.\nHe was a “sneakerhead” who loved to collect shoes and was always looking to buy a new pair, even if they all looked the same to his parents. He also loved music of all kinds, especially belting out Mizrahi tunes while in the shower, his family said. It was important to Yoad to serve in a combat role in the IDF, and he worked out with the Xpert combat fitness group to raise his profile before enlisting in the Nahal Brigade.\nYoad completed his military service in August 2023, just two months before he was slain. His family said he spent the time since working, exercising and planning a “big trip” abroad, after which he intended to return to Israel and study law and business management.\n“The thing that most characterized him was that he was a people person,” his mother, Tali, said in a memorial video. “He just loved people, and they loved him a lot… He had an incredible ability to love others and to accept them unconditionally. He gave that unique feeling to so many people, who really saw him as a true friend and a keeper of secrets.”\n“I miss his presence, I miss that feeling that he is here,” she added. “If I could meet him now, I’d sit him down on the couch and I’d embrace him and I’d stick to him… I’d tell him that I love him forever, that I’m proud of who he is and what he is, and I would do what I wanted to do but didn’t do when he left for the party — I would stand in the doorway and God himself wouldn’t be able to move me.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Or Yossef Ran, 29, a commander in the Duvdevan commando unit, from the West Bank outpost of Givot Olam, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Kfar Aza.\nWith the start of the Hamas attack, Or immediately jumped into action and headed down south to join up with his comrades near the front line, bringing along his nephew, Harel, who served under him in the unit. Along the way they encountered and battled several groups of terrorists, before arriving in the besieged Kfar Aza around 8 a.m.\nAfter hours of rescuing residents and engaging in firefights with the terrorists, Or’s armored vehicle was hit by an RPG, according to Israel Hayom, and when he and others jumped out they were ambushed by volleys of gunfire. Or was hit in the head and when his nephew came to help rescue the wounded, he realized it was his uncle, and watched him take his last breath as they waited for him to be evacuated via helicopter.\nOr was buried on October 10 in Givot Olam. He is survived by his parents, Sharona and Avri, and his nine siblings, Bitya, Mika, Sara, Daniel, Pinhas, Bat Ami, Ben-Hai, Sne and Porat.\nHe was born and raised in the West Bank outpost of Givot Olam, established by his father near the settlement of Itamar. He was part of a controversial family known for its settlement activism and brushes with the law as well as clashes with Palestinians in the northern West Bank.\nOr was the 8th out of the 10 Ran siblings, and grew up on the family’s farm, deeply involved in the agricultural lifestyle, working the land and spending most of his time outside, on a tractor or sleeping in a tent. He loved spending time in the field on his motorcycle, wearing paths out in the wilderness with its tires.\nIn 2012 he enlisted in the IDF in the Infantry Corps, going on to command a mobility squad, later moving from the [Unit 5515] combat mobility unit to the Duvdevan mobility unit.\nHis sister, Mika, told the Makor Rishon newspaper that “Orush was a hero, but that’s not what defined him. He loved life itself, and he was so fun and a prankster, alongside the fact that he lived with high idealism and values, with a full sense of mission and deep gratitude. It was very clear to him what he was doing, but it wasn’t heroic. He was a simple man, who loved life.”\nMika said Or “was a pedant. He was constantly tinkering with everything. From age 4 he had a toolbox… He had three motorcycles and two jeeps, those were his great loves. And the field. We keep looking at his photos again and again, and all of the pictures of him are from treks out in the field. His life was outdoors. He was a free soul, but very tidy and organized.”\nAnother sister, Bat Ami, wrote on Facebook to “Orush. Our love. So much pain. So much sadness. So many broken hearts.”\n“Turn the light on for us. It’s so dark here,” she added. “Look what we lost. We will continue to light things up, my love. You’re probably already making jokes with everyone up above. Driving the angels crazy.

    "story": "Sgt. Ofir Testa, 21, a soldier in the 7th Armored Brigade, from Jerusalem, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nStationed on a base near the Gaza border where he had been assigned just three days earlier, Ofir and his comrades — Staff Sgt. Shay Levinson, Sgt. Ariel Eliyahu and Cpl. Ido Somech — were sent toward the site of the Supernova music festival in their tank, according to Channel 12 news. They battled a number of Hamas invaders near the border, before the tank was hit by a grenade and Ofir was seriously wounded, but took control of the tank and kept moving.\nThey spotted what they thought were IDF soldiers, but quickly realized were Hamas terrorists who had stolen a military vehicle. They kept moving and came across the site of the festival, where there were major firefights going on. Ofir got out of the tank and with his final strength, gave his weapon to a festival guard who was fighting the terrorists unarmed, his family said, saying he was too wounded to keep fighting. Ofir turned to head back to the tank and was shot dead.\nAriel and Shay were also both killed, while Ido was seriously wounded but survived, and managed to use the tank to save some of the fleeing partygoers. Shay’s body was kidnapped by Hamas into Gaza where it remains to this day; his death was only confirmed in January.\nOfir was buried on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem on October 10. He is survived by his parents, Betty and Tal and his siblings Shahar, Dvir and Shira.\nBorn and raised in the Pisgat Ze’ev neighborhood of Jerusalem, Ofir was the second of the four siblings, and attended religious schools in the capital. After graduating high school, Ofir studied first in a yeshiva in the Golan Heights and then in Mitzpe Ramon, before ultimately enlisting in the IDF at age 20.\nRabbi Yehudah Rosencrantz, the principal of the Boys Town Jerusalem, where Ofir went to high school, said that “over the six years that Ofir attended Boys Town Jerusalem, he always had a smile on his face. You couldn’t help but be happy when Ofir was there.”\nHis uncle, Shimon, told a local news outlet that “Ofir was a boy who loved the Torah and the land. He didn’t enlist until he had studied Gemara… when the IDF called him up, he said, ‘I need to learn a little bit more about loving the land in order to serve the country.’ He kept studying until he felt ready to enlist.”\n“He was the salt of the earth, he wasn’t afraid of anything, he was a boy without fear,” his uncle added. “He always said, ‘This is my goal, to serve the country. This is a mitzvah.’ He was a modest kid, would do good in secret without anyone knowing, modestly, humbly.”\nIn an online eulogy, Ofir’s mother, Betty, noted that “unlike the way we raised your siblings, the path which we guided them to, you navigated your own path, when you understood how you wanted to develop, the direction you wanted to take.”\nHe was born in a rush, “you never had time, and just how you came into the world quickly, you wanted to get to everything,” she said. “At six months you were crawling to everywhere you could reach, at 10 months you were already running in the house. The first 4 years of your life you didn’t sleep and so neither did we — what you were so worried about, we never understood.”\nBetty wrote that Ofir “grew up and understood life so quickly. You knew how to differentiate the wheat from the chaff, at parents’ night we were always so proud, your teachers were always satisfied, and your grades were always good. You never asked for help… everything came easily to you… Everywhere you went, you brought your light with you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 217 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

When the rocket fire began, he and Hai ran for a nearby bomb shelter, where they soon realized that there was more to fear at the festival than missiles.\nAt 7:20 a.m., he sent his mother one last message: “Mom, if something happens to me, know that you are my whole world and I love you the most in the world.” Orel and Hai were both shot dead inside the shelter. His family searched for any word of him for several days before they were informed that his body had been identified.\nOrel was buried outside Haifa on October 11.

Following his release, he worked in a number of different jobs while pursuing his major dream — to produce techno music, a love he inherited from his parents.\nHe worked in deliveries and driving an ice cream truck, and in 2020 he moved to Hadera, where he worked as a waiter, before moving to Kiryat Motzkin in 2023.\nHe continually pursued a musical career, studying music production and creation at a school in Haifa, buying recording equipment, producing his own tracks and DJing at small festivals. He was planning to head to the US to visit his father and try his hand at pursuing music overseas.\nHis friend and collaborator Shahaf Zarfati wrote on Facebook that “at any event that I wanted him he would always come and not ask for a shekel. A modest guy with a huge talent in music. Just a couple months ago he gave me a closing set.”\nHis mother, Meirav, told a local news site that Orel “had a pure heart, a person you could never fight with. Someone would have to really work at it in order to get mad at him ever.”\nOrel “was a good person, he respected his parents,” although she noted that “I wasn’t so into his dream to be a DJ, I wanted him to also study alongside his desire and efforts to be a DJ.

    "story": "Master Sgt. Avi Buzaglo, 26, a detective at the Rahat police station, from Ofakim, was killed on October 7 while batting the Hamas invasion of his hometown.\nAvi was home with his family in Ofakim when the terror onslaught began. When he heard automatic gunfire outside, he didn’t hesitate and grabbed his weapon and police cap and headed out to the main road. His sister told a local radio station, “I asked him to wait a bit and figure out what was going on, and he said to me, ‘Are you serious? You think I’m going to hear that and not go out?’ And he left.”\nOutside, he joined up with an off-duty IDF soldier, 2nd Lt. Itamar Hadad, and an armed civilian, Itzhak Balti. The three of them engaged in a fierce firefight with the swarms of invading terrorists, killing many of them, until Avi and Itzhak were killed and Itamar was seriously wounded, but eventually evacuated and survived.\nThe head of the Rahat station where Avi worked, Commander Jayar Davidov, was also killed on October 7, as were fellow Rahat officers Command Sgt. Maj. Roni Abuharon and Sgt. Maj. Alon Bard.\nAvi was buried in Ofakim on October 11. He is survived by his parents, Zehava and Mordechai, his younger siblings Or and Aharon, and his girlfriend, Lital.\nBorn and raised in a religious family in Ofakim, Avi attended a pre-military academy after finishing high school and then enlisted in the IDF’s Duvdevan commando unit, according to a police eulogy.\nAvi was devoted to taking care of his family, always looking out for his younger sister and brother, an Ofakim municipal eulogy reads, and was also an active volunteer in youth groups during high school.\nIn 2020, he enlisted in the Israel Police and served as a detective in the Rahat station, going on to later lead detective shifts. He was an avid gym-goer, dedicated to extensive workouts, and had enrolled in a criminology degree that he never got to start.\n“I could talk about Avi for hours, I would always brag about him to my friends,” his little sister, Or, told a local radio station. “He was my big brother, nothing prepares you at age 25 to lose a brother you’ve lived with for so many years.”\nOr said Avi “was a role model. I admired him… he was our support system, always had our back. When people came to pay condolence calls they would say, ‘You can be comforted that he was a hero.’ But we already knew that. We knew who Avi was. During his lifetime he was also a hero. He was always ready, always on alert. When we’d go out to restaurants he would always insist on sitting facing outward, he’d never face inward… If I was ever afraid or worried to go anywhere, he’d say, ‘You’re with me.'”\nAvi’s younger brother, Aharon, wrote on an Instagram memorial page that Avi “always had a great deal of energy and strength to help others. That was always burning in his heart. Even at his friends’ weddings, he would work out so he could lift them on his shoulders.”\nAharon said his older brother “instilled in me a love of the land, of the people of Israel, and a motivation to enlist in a combat unit and give back as much as possible… He was the support system of the home. At work and everywhere he would connect to people in minutes. He was loved by all those around him.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Shachaf Bergshtein, 33, from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the kibbutz.\nA member of the kibbutz’s local security team, he was posthumously recognized as a fallen soldier with the rank of sergeant major in the reserves. Shachaf, an active IDF reservist, had also been called up for reserve duty that day but was killed before seeing the message.\nShachaf was missing for a week following the Hamas attack, until his family was finally informed that his body had been found. Little is known about the circumstances surrounding his final moments.\nHe was buried in Tel Aviv on October 14. He is survived by his parents, Shlomit and Dov and his siblings Yaakov, Tal and Levona.\nBorn and raised in Kibbutz Alumim near the Gaza border, Shachaf was heavily involved in all kinds of sports throughout his life, according to a local eulogy. He played soccer and basketball, matkot (paddle ball) at the beach, practiced yoga and above all was a devoted runner, regularly racing around the kibbutz fields in the early morning hours before work. He also volunteered as a guide to run in partnership with those with impaired vision.\nIn 2009, Shachaf enlisted in the Orev unit of the Nahal Brigade’s elite reconnaissance unit, first training as a paramedic, according to an Orev eulogy. After his release, he remained an active reservist, always showing up when called for duty, most recently in August 2023, when he received a notation of excellence for his service.\nShachaf studied hydraulic engineering and worked overseeing the irrigation of crops. After living most of his life in Alumim, Shachaf moved to Kfar Aza a few years before his death but continued to work in the agriculture of Alumim. He was remembered as a doting uncle to his nieces and nephews, a caring friend who was always on hand with his pickup truck to help people move, and a devotee of physical fitness.\nOn what would have been his 34th birthday, his sister, Levona, wrote on Facebook that they went to celebrate the day “at the sea because we probably would have found you here in the middle of summer — sitting in the shade of the Otentik [sunshade] on a comfy beach chair, then getting up to play matkot and then running into the sea, jumping into the water.”\nLevona wrote, “This is your 34th birthday, but you will remain 33 forever… I hope everyone here can take something from Shachaf, the friend he was, the endless generosity, his unique hobbies, his full enjoyment of life, because as Shachaf himself said at some point in 2009 — ‘It doesn’t matter how many years there are in life, it matters how much life there is in the years.'”\nHis brother, Yaakov, wrote on Facebook marking a year since he was killed, noting all the times and places Shachaf’s absence was strongly felt.\n“In all of our apartment moves, my hand went to press your name in my phone and ask for help — who else could I request help from without feeling bad, who would come and advise us how to pack and unpack things and do everything with a smile with a huge heart,” he wrote. “Your absence is felt in long conversations with our parents, in every conversation with Mom and Dad I think, ‘Where is Shachaf when you need him?’ To talk to Mom for hours, to tell Dad good morning at the start of every day in the fields.”\nWhen things got busy with the kids, Yaakov wrote, “I would imagine you here, lightening the load, taking the kids anywhere they asked… Going to the desert without you, out on a trek doesn’t compute, the trips and the nature isn’t the same anymore.” When their sister Tal got married, “you weren’t at the chuppah, not on the dance floor… it was so easy to imagine you there in the middle, drinking a little, smoking a little but mostly smiling and happy, as you always were.”\n“But the place you are most missed is inside me. I want you to come and tell us, ‘Yalla, enough crying, get up, keep going’… but it’s hard. The tears flow and your absence is felt in every place, at every event, in every breath.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 220 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Brando David Flores Garcia, 21, a driver in the IDF’s Gaza Division, from Beersheba, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the Kissufim outpost.\nBrando was stationed at Kissufim that morning, and ran with many others to the on-base bomb shelter when the air raid sirens sounded. Many of those gathered there were unarmed when they realized that terrorists had infiltrated the base and were throwing grenades inside the shelter.\nBrando and many others — including Staff Sgt. Benyamin Belay, Staff Sgt. Or Asto, Staff Sgt. Yogev Aharon and Staff Sgt. Teshager Taka — were slain in the battle.\nBrando was buried on October 11 in Beersheba. He is survived by his parents, Hector and Nelia Luz, and his two older sisters, Susan and Mirella.\nBorn in Pucallpa, Peru, his family moved to Israel in 2017, when Brando was 14. They settled in an absorption center in Beersheba, and Brando — who had played soccer in a number of different clubs in Peru and stood out for his talent — quickly picked up the sport again in Israel.\nHe was soon spotted by the Maccabi Beersheba team which invited him to join their roster. Brando enlisted in the army in 2021 in a special track to enable him to continue playing soccer for the Maccabi Beersheba professional team.\nNir Barad, who coached the team, told a sports news site that “when Brando joined the club he couldn’t say more than two words in Hebrew. Brando was an incredible example to all his friends of everything connected to generosity and solidarity. He always put the team’s success above his own personal success… The Maccabi Beersheba club salutes you and promises that your approach and your spirit will always be the one the club adopts.”\nBrando’s aunt, Judith Flores, told a Peruvian news outlet that she and her nephew “always talked. He would call me and tell me about his day on the military base, he was happy.” Judith said Brando was exploring his post-army options, and “he really liked soccer. Since he arrived [in Israel] he had been in several clubs and had many friends. He was a few months away from finishing and he told us that he wanted to be a policeman. He had always wanted to be a policeman.”\nOn what would have been his 22nd birthday, his girlfriend, Sharon Knap, wrote on Instagram that she was “so grateful that you came into my life to show me what real love was, to teach me how to love, to give and to receive.”\n“With you, things were so beautiful and calm, my love. I want to cause you pride in trying to continue your beautiful legacy by trying to continue your joy for life, by taking your pretty words and advice and making them come true,” she added. “You were and always will be the person who changed my life for the better, the person who saved me, who loved me, who picked me up when I fell and brought me the most beautiful period in my life.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

When the rocket fire began, the couple and other friends left the site of the festival in their car. At the Mefalsim Junction, Yovel recounted in testimony aired to mark a year since the attack, they encountered a white pick-up truck full of terrorists who opened fire.\n“He told us to crouch down under the seats as much as we could and to keep our heads down, to shout ‘Shema Yisrael’ and hope that we would survive this,” she recounted. Mor was shot dead in their car, and Yovel said she smeared herself with his blood so that the terrorists would believe she and their friends were dead. They hid in the car — which had overturned on the side of the road — for hours, pretending to be unconscious, until they were ultimately rescued.\nMor was buried on October 14 in Nahariya. He is survived by his wife, Yovel, his parents, Linda and Baruch, and his younger siblings Dor and Romi.\nBorn in Haifa, he was raised in Nahariya in the north, attending schools in the city, according to a state eulogy. He was active in a number of sports, including gymnastics, karate, basketball, soccer and Thai boxing, even trying out horseback riding and surfing.\nWhen he was 17, Mor experienced a bad car accident, which required multiple surgeries and a long hospitalization period, and granted him an exemption from military service. In 2023 he experienced another serious accident and again managed to survive and recover. He worked for years with his father in the family air conditioning business, before setting up his own a/c installation company about six months before he was killed\nMor and Yovel met in 2018 when they were both on a trip to Mexico, and quickly fell in love.

That they needed to watch out for me because if not they’d have to take it up with you,” he wrote. “I think about the years we had, the experiences we racked up, the things I learned from you without even knowing or intending — your manners, your acceptance of others, honoring your parents, women, your dedication to work… you always were and you always will be my role model.”\nIn April 2024, Yovel wrote a post on Facebook sharing their “save the date” card that had been sent out one year earlier.\n“If only I had known that this was going to be our goodbye party, I wouldn’t have let go of your hand forever, my love,” she wrote. “I wouldn’t have even let you go to work. So that every moment that was left we would have been together!”\n“I miss you so much my beloved husband,” added Yovel. “You were and will remain the light of my life, the one who taught me how to be the woman I am, who gave me everything I asked for, who loved me unconditionally and endlessly from the first moment.. I will walk in the path you loved, of joy, modesty, endless happiness and respect for every person.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Tomer Barak, 20, a Golani Brigade soldier from Petah Tivka, was killed on October 7 while battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nThe morning of the Hamas attack, Tomer was on a routine patrol near the Gaza border, next to the Paga IDF outpost, according to an IDF eulogy. When they realized that Hamas gunmen had infiltrated Israel, he and the other soldiers with him decided to exit their reinforced vehicles and fight them face-to-face. Tomer and several other Golani soldiers — including Sgt. Ido Binenstock, Staff Sgt. Itay Glisko and Staff Sgt. Itamar Ben Yehuda — were slain in the battle next to Paga.\nTomer was buried on October 11 in Petah Tikva. He is survived by his parents, Itai and Sharon, and his younger brother Tal.\nTomer’s close friend, Staff Sgt. Sahar Sudaei, was killed fighting in Gaza in May 2024.\nBorn in Modiin, Tomer grew up and went to school in Petah Tikva, a bookworm with a knack for languages and curiosity about the world, his family said. From a young age he dreamed of a combat role in the IDF, and worked out extensively to prepare himself, taking part in a number of preparatory courses and training.\nAfter finishing high school, he spent six months at the Shahar pre-military academy near Ashkelon, before enlisting in Golani in April 2022. After his death, the academy decided to rededicate itself in his name to honor his memory. Despite not getting the unit assignment he was looking for, Tomer threw himself into army life, his parents said, even working out on weekends when he would come home exhausted from training; his motto, they said, was “no excuses,” and he successfully completed a squad commander’s course.\nTomer had been making plans for his release from the army, including working as a bartender to save up money before taking a long trip to South America with his cousin, Michael, who was just three months younger than him.\nIn an interview with La’isha magazine, his grandmother, Hava, noted that Tomer was the first grandchild on both wings of the family and was “enveloped with love on all sides.”\nHava said that while she tried to convince him not to pursue a combat role, noting two family members she had lost during wars, “Tomer tried to stay polite but he stood his ground. He told me, ‘Grandma, it’s OK.’ During his army service, Tomer did not stop excelling… He was always the first to volunteer, anytime there was a task, or they’d ask who would stay for the weekend, he would raise his hand.”\nDuring the shiva mourning period, she said, all of his friends who came by “told us how funny he was, how he would make everyone crack up with laughter.”\nSpeaking to a sports news site, Tomer’s parents said in addition to devoting much of his time to fitness — including 5 a.m. workouts and spontaneous half-marathons — their son was a big fan of the Hapoel Jerusalem basketball team, a love he adopted from his parents and kept up despite not living near the city.\n“Aside from being a very good soldier, he was a very sweet kid, smiling, a good boy, moral, witty, sarcastic and incredibly funny,” his parents said. “He was really the glue of his friend group, people stuck to him everywhere he went in every stage of his life.”\n“On that Saturday, he did everything, everything he was trained to do to rise to the task,” they added. “He really did everything he could to protect the communities near Gaza, that’s what he enlisted for and that was his goal.

    "story": "Ben Benzion Hasid, 23, from Rishon Lezion, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while trying to flee the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nBen attended the rave with a group of four friends, an outing they had been planning and looking forward to for months. When the rocket fire began, the five of them got in a car and tried to head home, but they were attacked by a cell of Hamas terrorists lying in wait.\nThey got out of the car and ran, but Ben was slain alongside two of his friends, Guy Azar and Moshe Saadyan, while two of them managed to escape and survive.\nThe last Instagram photo Ben ever posted was in August 2023, a photo of him and Guy together with the caption “brother from another mother.”\nBen was buried on October 10 in Holon. He is survived by his parents, Mazal and Yom Tov, and his three older sisters, Pnina, Hen and Lital.\nBorn and raised in Rishon Lezion, Ben’s family said he was a happy easygoing kid, close to his family and a doting uncle to his nieces and nephews. He loved sports, particularly soccer and boxing, and also loved music and video games, according to a state eulogy.\nAfter finishing high school, he served in the IDF’s Kfir Brigade, and following his release worked in the fashion industry, dreaming of opening his own business. He always made sure to dress in high style, his family said, and also pursued his love of music, enrolling in an electronic music course just two weeks before he was killed.\n“Ben, you gave me the title of big sister,” Lital wrote on Instagram. “And I swore to myself that I would fulfill that role my entire life. When you were a baby you loved when I would scratch your back, and sing ‘Itsy Bitsy Spider.’ I’d pick you up from daycare and accompany you to school, when you grew up a little I found my best friend.”\nLital recalled working together at a local restaurant, spending hours together during COVID lockdowns, partaking in sports and exercise and having “deep conversations about life with the best conclusions like we were twins.”\nOne of the things Ben would often say, she recounted, was, “‘Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, it’s about dancing in the rain.’ Benzi, you were my warm place and you always will be, I promise you that my kids will know what kind of uncle they had. And eventually, I will come and we’ll dance in the rain.”\nOn what would have been his 24th birthday, Ben’s sister, Hen, wrote on Instagram, “I miss you like I’ve never missed anything or anyone in any situation.”\n“You are with me, I can feel it, watching over us, I’m sure,” she added. “Thank you for the privilege of being your sister… Help us succeed in being happy again.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Nadejda Spravchikov, 75, from Netivot, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in Sderot on October 7.\nNadejda and her sister, Natalia Tomayev, were part of a tour bus of mostly retired Israelis who were heading for a day trip to the Dead Sea early that morning. The bus got a flat tire near Sderot, and pulled into a bus stop in the city in order for the driver to fix it.\nWhile they were waiting outside the bus stop, air raid sirens warning of a rocket attack rang out. The bus stop had a bomb shelter with an automated door, that was supposed to unlock when sirens sounded, but it malfunctioned and the door remained locked. Moments later, a pickup truck of Hamas terrorists drove by and opened fire on the group of senior citizens, murdering all 13 of them, including both Nadejda and Natalia; only the driver survived.\nImages of the bus stop slaughter were among the first to circulate early that morning, shocking Israelis in their brutality and horrifying the family members of those who identified their loved ones in the photos. Nadejda’s daughter, Irit, told an independent news outlet that when she saw the photos, “I recognized immediately that it was Mom and her sister, from the clothes and their body shape.”\nThe family was nevertheless forced to wait nine days before they received official word that her body had been identified and she could be buried.\nBorn in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, in 1948, when it was part of the Soviet Union, Nadejda was the oldest among her siblings: Natalia, Vladimir and Leonid. She completed her schooling in the city and was active in a communist youth group, according to a state eulogy. After high school she attended university in the city, earning a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in chemistry.\nDuring her university studies, she met and married Anatoly, and they eventually had three children, Igor, Alexander and Irit. Nadejda worked in her field and in her spare time loved to pursue artistic endeavors, particularly with fabric and clothing, including macrame, knitting, embroidery and sewing.\nIn 1993, the couple’s three kids moved to Israel as part of a student program, and the parents followed not long after. They settled first in Kibbutz Geva before moving to Holon and then Netivot. Nadejda and Anatoly later divorced but remained on friendly terms, and Nadejda and her sister cared for many years for their mother until she died less than a year before they were slain. She also enjoyed spending time with her grandchildren.\nHer daughter, Irit, told At Magazine that the sisters “particularly loved visiting the Dead Sea, they loved to paddle around in the water. In November they planned to go on a trip to Eilat and after that to the Upper Galilee, they’d already paid for the trips.”\nAfter moving to Israel, Irit said, her mother switched careers and worked caring for the elderly: “When she made aliya, she decided that her calling was to help the elderly, even though she was old herself, she insisted on giving of herself to others and supporting those who needed it,” she told the Mako news site.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Nadav Popplewell, 51, was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists from Kibbutz Nirim on October 7, along with his mother, Channah Peri.\nChannah was released from captivity six weeks later. In June 2024, Israel announced that Nadav had been slain while in Hamas captivity. His body was recovered from the Strip by IDF troops on August 19, 2024, along with the bodies of five other hostages.\nNadav was seen in a Hamas propaganda video released in May, apparently weeks or months after his death, according to the IDF. He is believed to have been killed in Khan Younis in early 2024, although the circumstances of his death are not clear. On Nadav’s gravestone, his date of death has been left blank.\nNadav’s brother, Roi Popplewell, was murdered in Kibbutz Nirim on October 7 during the Hamas onslaught.\nNadav was buried on August 21, 2024, in Kibbutz Nirim, alongside his father, UK native Rafi, and his brother, Roi, who had originally been buried in Kibbutz Yagur and was reburied in Nirim on the day of Nadav’s funeral.\nNadav was described by loved ones as quiet and sensitive, a computer whiz who loved to read, in particular science fiction novels. He was a doting uncle to his nieces and nephews, and took excellent care of his mother, his family said.\nAt his funeral, his mother, Channah, said “you took care of me in captivity like you always took care of me. When I was released from captivity, you were alive with all the men. But nobody came for you, nobody worried after you.”\n“I’m leaving you next to Roi and you will both take care of each other, next to your beloved father,” she said. “And I know that in the future, we will see each other.”\nWriting on Facebook in October 2024, Nadav’s sister, Ayelet, described her feelings ahead of “the first Rosh Hashana without” her two brothers.\n“You’re definitely watching me from above and seeing me pretending to be strong and you must be bursting with laughter,” she wrote.\nAll she has left, she wrote “are memories upon memories. Today I made roast beef, just as you both liked, although Roi would complain that there were too many salads and not enough meat. Tomorrow when we light the barbecue for lunch, you won’t be there.”\n“You won’t be there when my children celebrate birthdays, like you weren’t there when we celebrated Mom’s 80th birthday two weeks ago,” Ayelet continued. “Know that we thought about you all day, and we think about you all the time. You are with me all the time… I hope you’re celebrating with Dad over a cold beer (or in Nadav’s case, a cup of orange juice). I hope you’re proud of me, and you know how much I love you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 226 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Israel Amichai Weitzen, 33, from Kibbutz Kerem Shalom, was slain on October 7 while defending the kibbutz from a Hamas invasion.\nA member of the kibbutz’s local security team, he was posthumously recognized as a fallen soldier with the rank of master sergeant in the reserves.\nAmichai and the other members of the kibbutz’s security team gathered early that morning when the rocket fire began, and split up into pairs to battle against the invasion of the Hamas terrorists of the small kibbutz, situated only around 100 meters from the Gaza border.\nWhile fighting the terrorists, Amichai sent voice notes to his wife and five kids holed up in their reinforced room, telling them that everything was under control and urging them to try to still find joy in the Simhat Torah holiday, but “definitely, definitely don’t look out the window… there are things they shouldn’t see.”\nIn the ensuing gun battles, Amichai was slain alongside his friend and fellow local security team member Yedidya Raziel, after eliminating terrorists who had holed up inside a family home. The rest of the kibbutz was saved and later evacuated alive, though two were seriously wounded.\nAmichai was buried on October 11 on Jerusalem’s Mount Herzl. He is survived by his wife, Talia, their five children, Tzur, Kerem, Ori, Ruth and Shahar, his parents, Rachel and Shlomo Yosef, and his seven siblings, Eicha, Tzvi, Tal, Elyashiv, Reut, Emuna and Yaakov.\nBorn and raised in the West Bank settlement of Psagot, he studied in the Alon Moreh hesder yeshiva and in the Har Hamor yeshiva before enlisting in the IDF, serving in the Golani Brigade. During his service he met and married his wife, Talia, and they lived in Jerusalem, then Ashkelon, before arriving in Kerem Shalom in 2017 as part of a project of religious Zionist emissaries to help shore up the struggling kibbutz.\nAmichai studied social work and worked most recently as a counselor at a local agricultural high school, where he was able to combine his passions for social work and education.\n“He was an educator, he was an incredible character in and of himself,” his mother, Rachel, said in an interview. “A family man, devoted, always carrying one or two of his kids… He was a hero, not in a physical sense, he wasn’t very muscular. He was a hero in his deeds, in the way he lived his life.”\nRachel said that Amichai was devoted to Torah study, even when working full time he always made sure he had a day off to devote to learning in yeshiva, “because he said that the Torah recharged him, he had to connect to it once a week… He would study in the morning in yeshiva with his brother as preparation to come to us at night and study with my husband, a rabbi and yeshiva head, and then get home after midnight. That’s a hero in my eyes — he lived as a hero and died heroically.”\nAmichai’s wife, Talia, told the Davar news outlet that Amichai “loved this land, he loved the Torah, he loved the kids. He was a man of spirit and light.”\nHe spent his life moving between education and social work, “and then he went to be a counselor at an agricultural high school, which was perfect for him. I saw his students after he was killed, and they feel like orphans.”\nTalia said she speaks with her children all the time about their father’s memory: “When I think about what he would have wanted, I know that he would want me to be happy and to live and to enjoy and to take life by storm… His presence is more tangible in our joy.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Yogev Aharon, 20, a Golani Brigade soldier from Pardes Hanna, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the IDF Kissufim outpost.\nYogev was stationed at the outpost next to the Gaza border that Saturday morning. Awakened by the rocket fire, he ran for the on-base bomb shelter, and when he realized that Hamas gunmen had infiltrated the base, he took his weapon and positioned himself at the entrance, barefoot and in pajamas, according to an IDF eulogy.\nThe Hamas infiltrators threw grenades inside the shelter, several of which Yogev threw back outside, until they threw another explosive inside which blew up, killing Yogev and six others, including Staff Sgt. Teshager Taka, Sgt. Uriel Segal and Staff Sgt. Or Asto.\nYogev was buried in Pardes Hanna on October 11. He is survived by his mother, Nehama, and his four older siblings, Dean, Adir, Oren and Aviv. His father, Amir, died in December 2022.\nBorn and raised in Pardes Hanna, Yogev was always a determined kid, his loved ones said, and despite a gentle soul, always dreamed of a combat role in the IDF. He was a prankster and always ready with a joke and a smile, friends said, livening up even difficult situations.\nHe enlisted in August 2021, serving as a Negevist in the Golani Brigade. A year later, his father died, and Yogev felt the need to be closer to his family and stepped back from a combat role, transferring to serve in the Golani war room on the Kissufim outpost.\nYogev’s comrade, Roi, wrote that he was “a person who was always smiling, and causing everyone around him to smile and laugh. Any dark moments the platoon would have, Yogev knew how to turn to a funny and less dark moment… Even when Yogev left the platoon because he was needed at home, he was always a part of us and we were all waiting for him to come back.”\nHis close friend, Adir Romano, wrote on Facebook that Yogev “was a kid everyone loved… I’ll never forget how you would do an impression of me and laugh your real laugh.”\nHe recalled the last time he saw Yogev, when he came up behind him on his motorcycle “with your shy smile… you told me how you were waiting to get out of the army and take a trip to South America for a year… You told everyone that you didn’t have much left, just another four months.”\nYogev’s brother, Adir, wrote, “I have no words that can describe what is going on here. I still think I’m in some nightmare or bad dream that I will wake up from at any moment. I love you so much… I hope and believe that Dad is already welcoming you up above.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Omri Niv Firshtein, 20, a Home Front Command soldier from Givatayim, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the Zikim IDF base.\nThe morning of the attack, Omri was stationed on base at the training base of the Home Front Command’s Search And Rescue Brigade in Zikim, where he worked as a combat driver. With the start of the attack, Omri told his family that he’d jumped out of bed and headed to the bomb shelters.\nWhen the commanders on base realized they were under attack by Hamas gunmen, they ordered the senior staffers to replace the trainees at the guard posts and sent all the new enlistees to shelter. Though Omri was not serving in a combat position, he took a trainee’s weapon and took up position at the front of the base, according to an IDF eulogy.\nFor 45 minutes, Omri battled against the Hamas invasion of the base and helped to evacuate the wounded before he was shot and killed shortly before 8:15 a.m. Ultimately, seven soldiers on the base that day were slain — Omri and Maj. Adir Abudi, Cpt. Or Moses, Lt. Adar Ben Simon, 2nd Lt. Yannai Kaminka, Staff Sgt. Eden Alon Levy and Cpl. Neria Aharon Nagari, the only trainee to be killed in Zikim.\nOmri was buried in Tel Aviv on October 10. He is survived by his three parents, Orly, Michal and Kobi, and his two younger sisters, Maya and Mika.\nHis gravestone is the first in IDF history to be engraved with the names of three parents after he and his two younger sisters were born as part of a shared parenting arrangement between his two mothers and his father.\nBorn and raised in Givatayim, spending weekends and holidays in Rishon Lezion, Omri was a sporty kid, taking part in judo, volleyball, soccer and tennis before focusing on his one true love, basketball, his loved ones said. He’d get up in the night to watch NBA games and refused to give up on playing even when COVID shut down his regular league. He also loved music, learning to play the guitar, and was also a youth leader and counselor.\nIn August 2021 he enlisted and was placed in the Home Front Command’s Search and Rescue Brigade, serving for a year and a half in the West Bank. His commanders sent him to a squad commander’s course, but a health issue in his back forced him to drop out and he moved to work on the training base at Zikim in June 2023.\n“Through conversations with people who came to console us, we heard that Omri danced all the time and made everyone laugh,” his mother, Orly, the deputy mayor of Givatayim, told Haaretz. “He was the heart of the company. He really loved the new recruits and had many conversations about issues relating to being an officer with Adir, the company commander.”\n“Maybe because I also come from a military background, and was in command and instructional positions for many years, Omri shared a great deal with me about how to develop resilience among soldiers and improve their ability to cope with crises,” she added.\nOmri’s younger sister, Maya, wrote on Instagram, “It is hard for me to imagine the world without you.”\n“Without the one person who can really make me listen to him, without your advice, without you sitting with me for hours while I cry and explaining to me that I’m not the one who’s wrong. How can I live without my funny brother, my pure and sensitive brother?”\n“The brother anyone would ask for, and I’m not just saying that,” she continued. “How can I go on without my brother, my guardian, who would tell me what he would and wouldn’t let me do, and we’d fight over it for hours. How can I go on without my partner in food, who loved exactly what I love, how could we have a barbecue without you manning the grill?”\nMaya wrote that she continues to imagine “you opening my bedroom door with a boom to scare me, in your uniform, already barefoot after you threw down your bag, running to me and jumping on me. You’d annoy me for an hour until I get annoyed at you. I promise you that if you do it again, I won’t get annoyed, Omri.

They stopped and sought safety in a roadside bomb shelter near Kibbutz Alumim.\nThere Sharon and many others were murdered when Hamas terrorists threw grenades inside the shelter. In a nearby bomb shelter, his childhood friend Idan Herman and Idan’s girlfriend Eden Naftali were also slain. Two months later, Sharon and Idan’s close friend, Maj. Ben Shelly, was killed fighting in Gaza.\nSharon was buried on October 15 in Kidron. He is survived by his parents, Limor and Eyal, and his three siblings, Tal, Sara and Moriya.\nBorn and raised in Kidron, a small moshav near Gedera, Sharon’s family said he loved the outdoors, riding bikes and learning Krav Maga, according to a state eulogy. In high school, they said, he didn’t spend much time in the classroom, but developed a love of playing music and photography.\nAfter graduating he served in the IDF’s Armored Corps, and was injured during his service but recovered and returned to the unit. After his release from service, Sharon worked a number of jobs, including as a bartender, event photographer and barber. Not long afterward, he enrolled in the Azrieli College of Engineering in Jerusalem to study mechanical engineering. He completed three years of studies and was slated to begin his fourth year just after he was slain.\nHis younger sister, Moriya, wrote on Instagram, “Sharon, my dear brother, you left us too soon. You were only 25 when you went and left behind a huge hole in the shape of your smile, which will never be filled.”\nMoriya said that Sharon “was our light at home, and I’ll never forget Friday nights when you would take out your guitar and play while Mom and I sang — I loved those moments so much… I hoped that we would have more time together, even if during that time you would just tell me to shut up. I wanted to see you grow up and develop, what I wouldn’t give just to see you one more time.”\nOver the past year, Sharon’s mother Limor shared posts of poetry and prose on Facebook describing her son, their memories and her mourning process.\n“Sharon was pedantic,” she wrote in one post. “He’d get a haircut every two days, with an iron in hand he’d straighten every crease before going out. He’d even organize the cups in the drawer. ‘It’s not important,’ I’d say, the drawer will be empty soon, but he wouldn’t answer and would keep arranging. He was like that — if you’d offer him something he didn’t want, he’d just not answer, simply wouldn’t respond.”\nIn another post, Limor wrote that she was “thinking what kind of food to make that Sharon likes. He likes red rice and Israeli couscous. I have to think of an excuse every time I make food that Sharon likes that nobody else does. Perhaps he’ll come…”\nLimor recounted in one post that “Sharon and I had a deal. He didn’t need to call me, but he’d send a photo. Not every day but often. If he forgot I would send him question marks (???) and he’d quickly respond with a photo.”\n“I wanted to see a forecast — if his expression was clownish or annoyed, wanted to see the color of his skin, if he slept enough or was tired. This deal between Sharon and me is over… it has expired.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Master Sgt. Eliyahu Michael Harush, 28, a police officer with the Sderot police station, from Ashdod, was killed on October 7 battling Hamas at the station.\nEarly that morning, when news began to trickle in about a Hamas infiltration of southern Israel, Eliyahu, who was on duty at the Sderot station, got a call about terrorists at the nearby Zikim Beach.\nUnaware that there were already terrorists in Sderot, Eliyahu headed out of the station and was killed battling the Hamas gunmen who had gathered outside. He is thought to be the first police officer slain that day.\nThe Sderot police station became the site of fierce battles throughout the day as Hamas gunmen stormed the building and holed up inside. Ultimately, Israeli forces razed the building to kill those remaining inside and end the standoff.\nEliyahu was buried on October 9 in Ashdod. He is survived by his wife, Hodaya, their three daughters, Lia, Ofri and Noya, his parents, Racheli and Yitzhak, and his six siblings, Efrat, Rivka, Aviya, Elhanan, Hila and Batsheva.\nBorn and raised in a Haredi household, Eliyahu enlisted in the Israel Police in 2020 through the Shahar program designed as a framework for the ultra-Orthodox to complete their mandatory service. He later signed on to remain in the police force.\nIn the wake of Eliyahu’s death, his younger brother, Elhanan, decided also to join the police force in his memory.\n“There’s no way to describe my brother’s heroism… He went out first, fought, wanted to save as many lives as possible,” Elhanan told the Kan public broadcaster. “I’m continuing in his path… He was really a guide for me, in every way.”\nTheir father, Yitzhak, told Kan, “We were proud to be the parents of Eliyahu. He was a special kid, sweet, with a lot of heart, a lot of soul. He’s in a good place — we have lost him. His wife has lost him, his sweet girls, he’s left them alone.”\nHis wife, Hodaya, who also serves in the Israel Police in the Netivot station, told Ynet that “my husband was the first to respond to the terror attack and the first to fall at the Sderot police station… I know that Eliyahu is the first to go out to defend and protect his comrades and the citizens.”\nHodaya said that despite the expected path for people from their community, “Eliyahu saw that he couldn’t study Torah, it was hard for him, but he said: ‘I want to give myself to the country, to the citizens.’ He was a Zionist Haredi, who loved the State of Israel. That’s how we were raised.”\nShe was in training at the police academy when he was killed, but said she had no doubts about continuing along that path after his death: “It was Eliyahu who sent my resume; Eliyahu knew what I wanted to do, which was to help Haredi women who couldn’t easily approach and speak out because it’s very difficult for crime victims to talk about difficult things… This is Eliyahu’s will: Eliyahu made sure that I joined the Israel Police – and he took care of me well, because they take good care of me – and for me, I’m here out of duty.”\nShe never forgets, she said, her husband’s bravery, and makes sure to always memorialize him: “Every day I talk about it, whether it’s with people, with my daughters, or even with myself. Every day I remind myself that I was married to a hero.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Vitali Logvinchenko, 34, of Ashkelon, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while out on a fishing trip on October 7.\nVitali set out that morning with his father-in-law, Oleg Lifshitz, to go fishing at a small reservoir near Kibbutz Ein Hashlosha, according to a state eulogy. When the rocket fire began, they quickly packed up and were planning on heading back to Ashkelon.\nAlong the way, their car was shot at by Hamas terrorists lying in wait along the highway, and they jumped out and tried to hide in the bushes. But a terrorist shot and killed them at close range, murdering them next to the Gama Junction just outside Kibbutz Re’im, according to Haaretz. Oleg’s body wasn’t found for a week, while Vitali was only located and identified after two weeks.\nVitali was buried in Ashdod. He is survived by his wife, Lilya, their son, Jaroslav, 5, his parents, Irena and Vladimir, and his sister Katya.\nBorn and raised in Ukraine, Vitali joined the police academy after graduating high school and worked in the field. In 2017 he and Lilya wed, after they had met long ago and reconnected two years before getting married. They settled in Kherson, Ukraine, and a year later, their son Jaroslav was born.\nBoth of his parents were deaf and Vitali had a close connection to that world, volunteering and helping within the community and making many friends with hearing loss.\nVitali set up a food stand in Kherson that became very popular and well-known in the city, his state eulogy read. In 2019, the family moved to Israel but returned to Ukraine not long after. When Russia was on the verge of invading Ukraine, Vitali returned to Israel and his wife and son followed not long after. Kherson became the site of heavy fighting during the ongoing war.\nThe family settled in Ashkelon, where Lilya’s parents also chose to live, and Vitali worked as a delivery driver for the Shufersal supermarket chain. Vitali loved to hang out at the beach and also to fish, which is what he was doing with his father-in-law the morning of the attack.\nAccording to Haaretz, Lilya, who taught ballroom dancing, was at a competition in London for the weekend, while their son was camping with his aunt, Katya next to Ashkelon. Katya told Haaretz that Lilya had a hard time getting back to Israel immediately after the attack, with most flights canceled, and their son stayed with relatives while the hunt for his father continued for two weeks: “He really misses his father. But he doesn’t cry because he doesn’t understand.”\n“Vitaly loved his extended family, would always spend time and celebrate holidays with them,” his eulogy reads. “He loved to cook and he would always invite and host and treat everyone with his cooking and tasty dishes. He always made sure there would be plenty on the table, and insisted that every holiday meal would end with a cake.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 232 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Ziv Shopen, 55, from Kibbutz Be’eri, was slain while attempting to defend his beloved kibbutz from the Hamas invasion on October 7.\nZiv was in Tel Aviv that weekend when the Hamas onslaught began, even posting a video on Facebook at 7:41 a.m. noting the surprise by which residents of the city reacted to sirens that were commonplace to him.\nBut when Ziv realized how serious the situation was in his beloved kibbutz, he decided he had to head down south and take part in the battle to defend it, his loved ones said. Ziv crossed through four different barriers attempting to stop him from getting there, but was not deterred, despite being unarmed, according to a state eulogy.\nUpon reaching the outskirts of the kibbutz around 1 p.m., Ziv joined up with a group of police officers who were heading inside, offering to help them as he was deeply familiar with the layout of the area. Before long, their two jeeps were hit by RPG fire and heavy gunfire, and Ziv and eight of the police officers were killed, including Supt. Vadim Blih, Chief Supt. Avi Amar, Sgt. 1st Class Dor Mangadi.\nHis body was not identified for 10 days.\nZiv was buried in Beersheba on October 17, less than a week before what would have been his 56th birthday. On September 20, 2024, he was reburied in his beloved Kibbutz Be’eri. He is survived by his sisters, Dganit and Shani.\nHe was born in Beersheba, the eldest child of Eli and Natali, immigrants from Tunisia, according to a kibbutz eulogy. In the 10th grade, Ziv decided he wanted to explore kibbutz life, and joined Be’eri, fitting in seamlessly to the agricultural life.\nDuring his mandatory army service, Ziv served in the Paratroopers Brigade, and continued to do reserve duty for many years. Returning to Be’eri, Ziv studied refrigeration engineering and became the go-to guy in the kibbutz for all air conditioning needs, making him a popular resident.\nHe was a devoted fan of the Hapoel Beersheba soccer team and had a love for travel, particularly in Asia, always picking up new friends along the way. In his early 50s he took off on a long trip overseas, spending two years traveling around by himself and collecting experiences. After he was killed, a member of the kibbutz found a book on the floor of his home: “1,000 Places to See Before You Die.”\nHis sister, Dganit, told a Kan podcast that Ziv “loved the kibbutz so much, loved the people there so much, the unique lifestyle there.”\n“His love for the place was so big that I can understand why he did it [insisted on joining the fight on October 7]. He wasn’t thinking about himself… He had to enter and to save lives,” she recounted. “I’m so proud of him, but my heart hurts so much.”\nDganit said her brother “was always a hero, always helped others… If Ziv ever saw that an elderly person needed help with their air conditioning, he would drop everything and run to help them… He loved life, he really loved kids,” she said. “If you ask me who Ziv is, he’s a person who from the most difficult and most complicated situation, he could find the good.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Master Sgt. (res.) Omri Belkin, 25, an instructor in the special forces LOTAR counterterrorism unit, from Ramat Hasharon, was killed on October 7 while battling Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Be’eri.\nOmri was called up the morning of the attack to reserve duty with his LOTAR comrades. Upon arriving down south, they entered Kibbutz Be’eri and tried to rescue the residents under siege by the Hamas invasion. Omri was killed there in the battle along with his comrades Maj. Sagi Golan and Maj. (res.) Roee Negri.\nHe was buried on October 11 in Ramat Hasharon. He is survived by his father, Roni, and his older brother, Roy. His mother, Roni, died in 2016, when Omri was 18.\nAccording to a memorial website, Omri “was an educator, sailor, soldier, beloved son and brother, and a person of exceptional character.” In high school, Omri, who always loved the sea, volunteered with the Tel Aviv Sea Scouts. After graduating, he did a year of national service with the Sea Scouts in Netanya, before joining LOTAR, the IDF’s elite counterterrorism unit. He stayed on in the IDF for a few months past his mandatory period, and continued to serve in the reserves, his family said.\nBoating and sailing was his true love, and after completing his army service he returned to leading the Sea Scouts in Netanya for 18 months before setting off to travel around eastern Asia with his brother and friends. They returned to Israel in September 2023, according to the memorial site, and Omri returned to volunteering with the Sea Scouts. He was slated to soon after begin studies at Tel Aviv University in law and political studies, according to the university.\nHis loved ones succeeded in raising more than NIS 250,000 to donate a new sailboat to the Sea Scouts in his honor, writing that: “To him, a boat was not just a vessel but, first and foremost, a means to teach mutual responsibility, accountability, cooperation, respect, true friendship, and, of course, the joy of sailing and the love of the sea.”\nOmri’s friend, Adam Gabay, told a Kan podcast that he and Omri had known each other since they were 10 years old, and grew up together in the Tel Aviv Sea Scouts.\n“He spent six months in the Far East, he came back to Israel just two weeks before October 7,” Adam recounted. “He wanted to study law, like his mother, of blessed memory, she was a very well known lawyer… He admired her, he rode a motorcycle like she did, he wanted to study law like she did.”\nBut on October 7, Adam said, “he was one of those people, who saw that something was going on and woke up and just took themselves” to the front lines to join the efforts. Omri, he said, “was a guy of music, of love, of the sea, of laughter and of fun.”\nOmri’s brother, Roy, wrote on Facebook about the pain of “losing your best friend… plus the fact that he was my little brother.”\nOn what would have been Roy’s 26th birthday, Omri wrote, “the first without you, my brother, 250 friends came to celebrate your birthday in our yard, to throw tomatoes at comedians and to memorialize you exactly as you were — strange, totally crazy and absolutely hilarious.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

They fled together when the rocket fire began and tried to hide in the forest near the highway when they realized that Hamas terrorists were opening fire on passengers, but they were both killed.\nOr’s family searched for any news of him for a week before they were informed that he had been killed and his body identified.\nHe was buried on October 13 in Adi, days before his 24th birthday. He is survived by his mother, Sima, and sisters Dana and Liel. His father, Reuven, died of a heart attack when Or was 13, a loss his family said hit him hard.\nOr was born in Romania, and was adopted by Sima and Reuven when he was six months old, according to a state eulogy, delighting his older sisters who had been begging for a new sibling. After finishing high school, he served in the IDF’s Kfir Brigade, and after his release, he spent time traveling, in particular in Europe, which he loved visiting.\nOr was working at a textile import company, after a period employed installing solar panels on roofs. He was also pursuing a burgeoning modeling career. He loved to hang out with his friends and to party, his loved ones said, and was also very close to his family, sharing a joint tattoo with his sisters of a clover, and putting in plenty of babysitting hours with his nieces and nephews.\nHis sister, Dana, wrote on Instagram about all the things she misses about Or, from the fact that “there is nobody at work for me to annoy in the morning before I smoked a cigarette, or update me on what happened at home the day before.”\n“I miss how you’d get mad at me if I said something you didn’t like and then after you’d think about things, I’d get a message saying, ‘My sister, I know everything you said was for my own good,'” she continued. “I miss your laughter, I miss our conversations, I miss everything… I miss you so much.”\nWriting a month after he was killed, his sister, Liel, said, “If only we would have known, we would have hugged you a little bit more, told you a little bit more how you were the best and you were ours.”\nIn the weeks after Or was slain, Liel wrote, “We got a peek into the life of Or Ziv, the friend, the soldier, the student, the salesman. So many people who throughout the years who you probably already forgot came to tell us who you were to them.”\n“And we were privileged too. We got to be together. A super close and united family who dealt with everything. You, who grew up with the difficulties of a preteen and didn’t always smile, but kept fighting alongside us to grow up and become a huge light, shining, optimistic and unique.”\nLiel added that she was “imagining you up there sitting among the angels, with your smile and your sparkling eyes.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 235 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

Most of them ran to the right, but Yarden’s friend Daniel Sheinkerman headed left, and Yarden decided to follow him, and they were both slain by Hamas while the rest of the passengers survived.\nHis parents didn’t know that he was attending a rave next to the border with Gaza until after the attack, and they searched for word of him for four days until his body was identified.\nYarden was buried in Kibbutz Kfar Masaryk on October 13. He is survived by his parents, Merav and Shimon, his older siblings Liad and Sapir, and his girlfriend Amit.\nBorn and raised in Kfar Masaryk in the Western Galilee, Yarden enlisted in the IDF’s prestigious 8200 intelligence unit after completing high school. He stayed on for an additional year following the mandatory period, and after his release he moved to Tel Aviv with his girlfriend, Amit, according to a state eulogy.\nThere he started working in hi-tech, getting jobs in a number of startups, most recently the software company Spot by NetApp. Kevin McGrath, who was at the time a VP at Spot, wrote on Linkedin that Yarden was “a bright young product manager, who had all the positive energy in the world and a promising life ahead of him.”\nYarden enjoyed several hobbies, his loved ones said, including carpentry and hydroponic gardening, and also loved to travel and take part in extreme sports around the world, including kite surfing, skiing and snorkeling — visiting Iceland, Australia, Sri Lanka and more.\nHis girlfriend, Amit Tzafri, wrote on Instagram to “my soulmate… the purest creation in this world.”\n“I got to live by your side, to build a home with you, to wake up with you in the morning and to kiss you good night,” she added. “To cry to you about all the pain in my heart, that only you knew, and all the joy in my heart, that you knew better than anyone. The way you looked at me, with stars in your eyes, I wish I could see myself one day the way you saw me, and believe in myself the way you believed in me.”\nIn a memorial video produced by Ynet, Yarden’s parents spoke about how much their son had accomplished in his short life.\n“Yarden took life by storm, he was a very creative kid, he had a creative way of thinking, he thought about what could he bring into this world, what can he create that could help the world,” said his mother, Merav. “He always had thoughts like that. He was also very creative with his hands, he built things out of wood.”\nShimon said that as his youngest, Yarden was the one with whom he “fixed” his approach to fatherhood.\n“We had a very unique relationship, we spoke about everything, everything in the most open and free way, conversations whose absence I feel so strongly now,” he said.\nYarden, he said, was a man of social connections, “I couldn’t believe how a kid at age 25 could have touched thousands of people. If he managed that by age 25, who knows what else he could have kept doing.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Hillel Zalmanovich, 60, from Ashdod, was murdered by Hamas on October 7 while out riding his bike near Kibbutz Kissufim.\nHe set out early that morning for a bike ride as he did almost every Saturday, his family said, choosing a route that wound past Kissufim and the nearby Kibbutz Be’eri. With the start of the rocket fire, his worried wife called him at 6:43 a.m. and asked him to come home. His last words to her — or anyone — were, “OK, I’m coming back.”\nHis family searched for him for five days, until two ZAKA volunteers located his body and his bike along the side of the bicycle path. They also recovered his smart watch, which told them that Hillel was shot dead at 7:40 a.m. while he was mid-bike ride.\nHillel was buried on October 12 in Ashdod. He is survived by his wife, Tikva, their three children, Nir, Tzlil and Noy, and seven grandchildren.\nBorn and raised in Ashdod, he attended the Techni Air Force High School in Haifa, before enlisting in the Nahal Brigade and training as a sniper. He fought in the 1982 Lebanon War as a sniper, according to a state eulogy.\nHe later took part in the Nahal settlement program, through which he met his wife, Tikva, and they wed in 1985 and settled in Ashdod, raising three children. Hillel studied computer engineering and got a job with the Israel Electric Company, where he remained for 30 years before taking early retirement in 2018, at age 55.\nAfter his retirement, Hillel decided to pursue a lifelong dream and enrolled in a tour guide’s course, completing it successfully and taking groups out to explore the country and landscape he loved so much. Throughout the years he always stayed active, biking regularly as well as hiking and exploring Israel, and even swimming competitively.\nWriting on Facebook, his daughter, Noy, said, “My father was an introvert, we wouldn’t have daily phone conversations but that never made me feel less close to him.”\nNoy added, “When I told him what I was going through, I could see the joy or the sadness in his eyes, I knew from just that look that he was pained by my pain, sad in my sadness and happy in my success. I always felt how much energy he had when he saw me happy, satisfied by my place in life and the life I built — this was enough for me and more significant than words.”\n“Thank you for who you were for me, for being a role model through your incredible relationship with Mom, your Zionism and your love of the land, the values of friendship or gratitude and — what would you always say? — patience and faith.”\nHis wife, Tikva, wrote on Facebook to “Hillel, my beloved husband. You will forever be engraved in my heart.”\n“If I can find the strength, I will keep up our tradition of traveling around Israel, and maybe I’ll even finish the few days we had left on the Israel Trail,” she wrote. “My dear children, the coin has flipped and instead of a supportive Mom and Dad, you have left a broken and destroyed mother.”\nTikva later added, “I cannot come to terms with the fact that you are no longer here. We had so many plans, and everything was cut short with painful horror.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 238 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

He left home from his kibbutz near Beit Shemesh and headed to Ashkelon, where he joined up with some of his comrades.\nTogether they headed to the Yiftah IDF outpost next to Zikim, where he was shot dead by Hamas gunmen while trying to evacuate those who had already been wounded.\nSahar was buried in Tzora on October 12. He is survived by his parents, Pnina and Erez, and his siblings Rotem and Shaked.\nAs a basketball lover, his family is working to raise funds to refurbish the court in Kibbutz Tzora in his memory, to give new life to the place “where he could be found every Saturday night, tossing toward the basketball and most of the time making it.”\nIn a post on a memorial Instagram page, friends of Sahar, who was known as “Chico” around the kibbutz, described him as a “boy who was always happy.”\nThey want people to know “about all of the joy that he spread and all of the light that was in him — because there was a lot. Sahar was the kind of person who just saw the good in things, he enjoyed the simple things and wasn’t materialistic, he knew how to appreciate everything.”\nWriting on a memorial site for fans of the Maccabi Tel Aviv basketball team, Sahar’s father, Erez, said his son was “very beloved by his classmates and all his childhood friends. He was an excellent athlete, the number one sprinter in his grade, a happy child and teen, always smiling, nothing was difficult or hard for him.”\nErez wrote that Sahar “loved to dance, loved to learn, and really loved sports.” He played basketball with a youth and teen league in the region and was also a counselor in the local youth troop. “And in addition he always really loved Maccabi Tel Aviv.”\nSahar “really loved his army service, he viewed it with a great sense of mission and a way to achieve his aspirations.

    "story": "Dudi Sharon (Shukrun), 47, from Nahariya, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while trying to flee the Psyduck music festival on October 7.\nDudi was one of 16 people out of the 100 or so people who attended the small electronic music festival near Kibbutz Nirim who were slain when they tried to leave following the rocket fire and were ambushed by gunfire along the highway.\nHe was considered missing for two weeks until his body was finally identified. He was buried in Nahariya on October 22 and is survived by his two sons, Shani and Ran, his parents, Perla and Yosef, and his sister.\nDudi described himself on Facebook as a “comedian, writer, and music producer,” running his own online marketing firm. He was also a vegan and animal rights activist, who was very devoted to the community and to spreading awareness of the cause.\nHe was the original founder of the Elektro Digital marketing firm, which noted that he “chose its unique name because of his love for electronic music.”\nHe was known for being an avid social media user, posting quips and jokes to his Facebook and X feeds. A few months before he was killed, he shared online: “People keep asking me why I don’t do politics. Well, I never saw anything positive that could come of picking a side. I don’t want to wake up one day only to find that I’ve wasted my life hating people I’ve never met. I was given the best gift I could ask for, the ability to make people laugh. This is something the world could really use right now. And I’m all in for it!”\nHis friend, Keren-or Green, tattooed one of his more popular tweets on her arm in his memory: “Life is too short. Be sure you’re making the right mistakes.”\nDudi’s friend Ori Shavit wrote on Facebook of their decade-long friendship, born of their love for animals and shared veganism: “He cared so much about animals. From his most beloved cats to cows, sheep and chickens. He had a huge heart which had room for everyone and he had compassion for all living things in the world.”\n“This activism was so important to him,” she said, and he worked pro bono to promote her vegan blog as well as many others for years. Alongside his compassion, Ori said, he had a wicked sense of humor, “and was one of the funniest and most sarcastic and cynical people.”\nDudi was a music producer and DJ, deeply involved in the electronic and trance music world alongside many of those at the Psyduck festival. Together with his musical partner, Bar Kiryati, the duo referred to themselves as “Infernous.”\nSharing a link to one of their songs, Bar wrote on Facebook that “our goal was always to make the best music we could, and also to do things we thought weren’t possible.”\nBar noted that just a few days before he was killed, Dudi shared a clip of their music on Spotify “without even asking me… it’s excellent but not finished. I was so mad at you! Until I got over it. You were so hungry for the music we wrote to reach people’s ears, to pinch them where they needed it and move something inside them. Don’t worry my brother, I promise I will do my best.

    "story": "Sgt. Uriel Segal, 19, a soldier in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion, from Petah Tikva, was killed battling Hamas terrorists in the Kissufim IDF outpost on October 7.\nUriel and 17 other soldiers holed up inside the outpost’s mess hall, waging fierce battles against terrorists invading the Kissufim outpost, when they began throwing hand grenades at the soldiers. Uriel picked up the live grenades and threw them back at the terrorists, one by one, before they could explode.\nUltimately, the terrorists threw a powerful charge inside the shelter, killing Uriel and several of his friends, including Maj. Raz Peretz, Staff Sgt. Or Asto and Staff Sgt. Teshager Taka.\nUriel was buried in Petah Tikva on October 10. He is survived by his parents, Naama and Adi Avraham, and his brothers, Netanel and Yaakov.\nFrom an early age, Uriel dreamed of serving in the Golani Brigade, having heard stories of the brigade’s battles and bravery from his grandfather, his mother, Naama, told the Makor Rishon newspaper. He later joined the AMIT yeshiva but rejected his friends’ pleas to postpone his enlistment in the army to join them in advanced studies, and was thrilled to have been tapped for Golani, according to a friend.\nAs a high school student, he also visited Poland and returned with a renewed and profound view of his role in Jewish history, his mother said. A middle child, Uriel was “sandwiched between two brothers. He was born on the 5th night of Hanukkah, so we decided to call him Uriel, which symbolizes light and joy,” added Naama.\n“The fact that he gave his life for the sanctity of our people and land dulls our pain,” she said. “At home and in the yeshiva, we inculcated these values in him and he grew up on loving and giving, which is how he acted in his last moments.”\nBefore he enlisted in the army, his brother Yaakov asked him what would happen if he fell in battle.\n“If I fall in battle, I want it to be in defense of my homeland and for the sake of those who did it before me and will do it after me,” he replied, according to a eulogy by his brother Yaakov.\n“Uriel was always joyful and eager to help, without any regard to religion, race or gender. That’s how I’ll always remember him,” he added.\n“From an early age, you could tell he was a true friend,” Hadas Shamir, a teacher at the AMIT yeshiva told local media. “Everyone we encounter says he was a true and beloved friend and a good listener… even when he had been hanging out with friends on Friday night, he would still make it to Shabbat morning prayer.”\nRabbi Nitzan Berger, the head of the yeshiva, got to know Uriel on his trip to Poland as a 12th grader.\n“It was undoubtedly a very important trip for Uriel,” he told Makor Rishon. “It attested to his true core. There was a misleading quiet about Uriel. Often, you see quiet people and assume they have nothing to say, but it was completely different with Uriel. Something important would suddenly trigger him and you could tell he had something to say, an internal fire which wasn’t always discernible. In hearing his parents, I realize he got it from them.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 241 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

He is survived by his children, Adi and Liad, his parents, Regine and Shlomo, and his younger siblings, David and Keren.\nBorn in Istanbul, Avi moved to Israel with his family when he was less than two years old, according to a state eulogy.

In 1999 he married Carmen, and they had two children before divorcing following 14 years of marriage.\nHe had moved from Beersheba, where he had lived most of his life, to Ofakim just a few weeks before he was killed, to be closer to his work as manager of a Shufersal supermarket branch in the city. His hobbies, his loved ones said, included reading, dancing, playing board games with his kids, and above all taking trips to the Kinneret, the Sea of Galilee, which he loved and would make sure to visit several times a year, setting up camp on its shores.\nOren Anolik, the Israeli ambassador to Cyprus, wrote on X that he served with Avi during their military service, describing him as “extraordinarily handsome, with sparkling eyes, a big smile, boundless energy, and magnetic charisma. He possessed a magical charm; women adored him, and men wanted to be his friends.”\nAt Oren’s wedding, he recalled, Avi “set the dance floor on fire. Naturally, he was one of the last to remain, jumping into the pool wearing nothing but underwear. That’s how it was with him: fun and wholehearted.”\nAvi’s cousin, Sigalit Levin, told the South African Jewish Report that he was “the most wonderful father, son, grandson, brother, nephew, and our first cousin.”\n“Avi was the most selfless human and always made his family a priority. Continents apart, I’m so grateful for our WhatsApp video calls or voice notes,” she added. “You gave the biggest hugs, and you meant it! We’ll treasure the times spent together as a family with you in Israel. We’re absolutely heartbroken.”\nHis daughter, Adi, told a local news outlet that her father was “a family man from head to toe, the support system for all of us. He always did everything to keep the family unit intact, and for us to be there for one another even when things were hard.”\nHer father, she said, “always loved life, had endless energy and radiating charisma. He would present himself in different and unique ways — if you’d ask him for his full name, he’d introduce himself as ‘Avi the handsome, smart and modest.’ He really was handsome and smart and in an ironic way — very modest. He would never brag and he had no arrogance, he would just say it to be funny.”\nAdi said that her father would enjoy joking about his “full name,” but he would “always say that he was the most proud to introduce himself as the father of Adi and Liad. He was our biggest supporter, believed in us when we didn’t believe in ourselves, always made sure we would challenge ourselves, and never give up on any of our dreams.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 244 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Itay Eliyahu Martsiano, 20, a platoon sergeant at the Paratroopers Brigade’s training base, from Beit Arif, was killed battling Hamas terrorists near Kibbutz Yad Mordechai on October 7.\nAt home on break the morning of the attack, Itay immediately headed to the front lines to join his comrades when he realized the scope of the attack. They set out toward Kibbutz Yad Mordechai, and near the entrance they encountered a group of runners from Sderot being attacked by a terrorists cell.\nItay, Staff Sgt. Ilay Gamzo, and two of the runners, Naomi Shitrit Azulay and Kobi Paryante were slain amid the firefight, while several others were wounded.\nHe was buried on October 9 near Lod. He is survived by his parents, Frida and Shlomo, and his two older sisters, Hila and Chen.\nItay was born and raised in Shoham, and his family had moved to the nearby Beit Arif in recent years, according to a eulogy on the Maccabi Haifa memorial site. He started playing soccer at age 5, and kept it up until he enlisted, with a true love of the sport.\nHila, who was 15 years older than Itay, told Channel 13 news that she begged her parents for another sibling, including putting on a show to attempt to convince them, and was overjoyed when he joined the family.\n“I was like his mom, we were sort of the backup [parents], teaching him things, taking him to daycare, changing diapers,” she recounted. “And socially, he’d join our friends, he was sort of like our toy. As he grew up, he was so successful in everything, everything he touched — sports, he was super smart, he was a genius, our relationship became more like that of friends, and then he became an uncle.”\nWriting in Ma’ariv ahead of Memorial Day, his mother, Frida, described Itay as “social, beloved, smart, talented and with a tendency to charm.”\n“A boy to whom all the possibilities were open to be who he wanted to be. An excellent student, a talented soccer player, a musical child who loved to play and sing but was modest and hid his capabilities,” she continued. “But the thing that most characterized Itay was his huge love for his family, his friends and the country. A boy with morals who was willing to sacrifice his life for his friends and for the citizens of the State of Israel.”\nThe morning of October 7, she wrote, “I tried to stop you, to slow you down a little, but with the decisiveness of a boy becoming a man, you told me: ‘Mom, this is what I enlisted for.’… I wanted you to stay my own boy, my baby, and not one of the heroes of an entire nation.”\n“We won’t celebrate your 21st birthday, because you’ll stay forever 20, you won’t take a big post-army trip as you wanted and had already planned for… You won’t keep studying, won’t get married, won’t have children, and we — we won’t have you. My boy, you were a child, a simple, modest, talented, smart, beautiful, strong boy, but a boy. A boy with dreams who wanted to live, who wanted to enjoy, to hang out, to grow up and to build a life in this country he loved, with the family he loved and the friends he loved.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

All four of them worked together at the 2c restaurant and bar in Tel Aviv, which is where Nir and Shoham first met.\nThe four of them fled the site of the festival via car when the rocket fire began, and chose to seek safety in a roadside bomb shelter. There, all four of them were killed when Hamas terrorists threw grenades and opened fire on those huddled inside.\nShoham was buried in Beit She’an on October 11. She is survived by her parents, Lidia and Shimon, and her younger brother Hoshen.\nShe loved to travel, with pinned Instagram highlights from all of her recent destinations — Mykonos, Egypt, Portugal, Berlin, Istanbul, Sinai and more. She had tickets for October 8, 2023, for a trip to Turkey with her mother. In her apartment, her family found her suitcase packed and ready to go.\nAccording to a memorial book, Shoham explored many extracurriculars in high school, including dance, piano and drama. In the army she served as assistant to the commander of the Jordan Valley Brigade, and toward the end of her service she was posted as a security guard at the Allenby Bridge border crossing.\nAfter being released, Shoham moved to Tel Aviv and started working as a waitress and later manager at the 2c restaurant, where she met Nir, and was also studying in a course to be a security guard and private investigator.\nWriting on Instagram, Gaya Lek, a friend of Nir and Shoham, noted that “from the moment they met until they were taken from us too soon they did not part for a moment.” The couple, she wrote, “were a true match, from the depths of their souls, just like in fairy tales. A once-in-a-lifetime kind of love.”\nThe pair “loved to celebrate life, to laugh and dance and be happy… We’ll remember them always in our hearts and we’ll never forget.”\nShoham’s brother, Hoshen, wrote on Instagram that “anybody who didn’t know you missed out, missed out on your incredible personality and all your inner qualities, in addition to your beauty and all the external things that couldn’t be missed.”\n“Anywhere you went, anybody sitting next to you couldn’t be sad, and you couldn’t help making people happy,” he continued. “You are the best person I know… I know that no matter what, wherever you are, you’re making everyone with you happy.”\nHer mother, Lidia, wrote on Facebook ahead of Memorial Day that Shoham “lit up the sun. She would shine in the morning and join the stars in the evening.”\n“She gathered friends and connected everyone. She was a source of joy and love, she only spread good and dreamed of peace between everyone,” added Lidia. “Her eyes shined like sparkly crystals… Your light will shine forever, your spirit will always be among us.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Reuven Weisman, 57, from Ofakim, was murdered by Hamas terrorists next to his home on October 7.\nThe morning of the attack, Reuven told his children to hide in the bomb shelter in their backyard. Fearful of the terrorist invasion of the neighborhood, he left the shelter to patrol the area, armed with nothing more than a metal rod, his children said.\nA terrorist in the neighbor’s backyard shot Reuven in the head while his children watched on. “I saw it happen, I saw how his glasses flew off his face when he was shot,” his daughter told Ynet.\nHe was buried in Ofakim. He is survived by his children, Lior, 32, Koral, 31, Shoham, 26, and Gil, 25, his grandchildren Alma and Lavie and his siblings.\nHis father, Maurice, a Moroccan immigrant, was killed fighting during the Six Day War before Reuven turned 2. Born and raised in Ofakim, after finishing high school Reuven enlisted in the army and served as a driver for heavy equipment. After his release, he pursued a career as a truck driver, according to an Ofakim eulogy.\nReuven’s sister, Ayala, said in a memorial video that he “lived a simple life, a life of work, home, work, home, a modest man. I learned many things from him and his strength,” she said, noting that in later life Reuven decided to become religiously observant, in particular after the death of their mother.\n“He went though so many things in life,” she said, also noting a difficult divorce. “He worked nonstop to take care of his children — he worked just so he could provide for his children,” and would cook for the whole family. “He had a huge heart, he was very generous.”\nHis daughter, Koral, told Ynet that her father “was the support system for all of us, since he was killed — the family has fallen apart. He was the one who always made sure that everyone had somewhere to live, he’d cut corners for himself so we wouldn’t be lacking.\n“He was a modest man — except for cigarettes he never bought himself anything,” she added. “At home, there was always tons of food, he knew how to support the family. I will thank him my whole life for teaching me that lesson.”\nThe day of the attack, she said, he ordered his children to hide while he set out to try and protect them.\n“That was Dad, he wasn’t afraid, he was just concerned for his children,” she said.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 247 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Cpt. Yotam Ben Bassat, 24, a commander in the Multidomain Unit, from Bat Hefer, was killed on October 7 battling Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Re’im.\nYotam, a commander in the special ops unit also known as the “Ghost” unit, was on base that weekend and jumped into action with the start of the attack. He and others in the unit were sent south to Kibbutz Re’im to battle the Hamas gunmen who had invaded, killing and kidnapping many in the community.\n“Yotam linked up quickly with the local security team there, understood the situation and led the fighting,” his comrade told Ynet. “He kept pushing us forward and we started to go house by house [rescuing those inside].”\nDuring the firefight, Yotam was killed alongside the commander of the unit, Col. Roi Levy, after he was shot just above his ceramic vest, and was evacuated to a hospital but died of his wounds.\nYotam was buried on October 10 in Netanya. He is survived by his parents, Tami and Benny, and his younger brothers Rom, 19, and Noam, 14.\nHe grew up in Bat Hefer, outside Netanya, and was a talented tennis player, even winning local tournaments, as well as a dedicated fan of the Maccabi Netanya soccer team.\nYotam enlisted in the IDF in March 2018, serving first in the Duvdevan commando unit before being recruited in 2020 to join the elite Multidomain Unit, which had been established by the military chief of staff just a year earlier. He reupped following his mandatory service period, and had been slated to be released just six days after he was killed, his family said. Yotam, they said, had big plans and dreams for his post-army life, including traveling abroad and eventually starting his studies.\nHis comrade, who met Yotam during their basic training, described him to Ynet as “a small guy, not tall, not big, not strong, but he had a huge soul… he was the sucker who would volunteer for everything. There were nights when we’d return to base after a tough night and we had to do guard duty, everyone 20 minutes, and Yotam would say, ‘Go to sleep, it’s all good, I’m not tired,’ and do it for us. He preferred that we’d sleep well and he would suffer silently.”\nTherefore, he added, on October 7, “when he volunteered first and jumped into action, it wasn’t a surprise, because he was always like that — but this time it cost him his life.”\nYotam’s cousin, Chen Raz Banai, recalled on Facebook how “all my life I was by your side,” even remembering attending his brit mila, and begging to be allowed to babysit, “even though you’d spit up on me every time.”\n“A mischievous boy with a captivating smile, who became a modest, wonderful man, who was always there for everyone, who everyone loved,” she continued. “We even got our driver’s licenses together, I told you that you couldn’t pass your test before I did. We spoke so much about your army service and what you would do, and then about when you would finally get out… I’m sorry, my Yoyo. I’m sorry.”\nIn a post marking a year since Yotam was killed, his father, Benny, recalled him coming home just a day earlier, bringing with him piles of laundry, “sitting and drinking the espresso you loved” and talking about his plans for his upcoming release from the army.\nRight before his slated release, Yotam was scheduled to take part in a joint training exercise in the United States with the US Army, and he said goodbye to his family that day, not expecting to see them again before his flight: “You went one by one and hugged us all and we wished you a good trip,” wrote Benny. “I accompanied you to the car, I hugged you and I think I even snuck in a little kiss on your cheek… If only we had known if was goodbye forever.”\n“Yotam, it’s been a year since we met, and I still live with the feeling that you’ll come back. Every Friday I wait for the call from you, ‘Dad, I’ll be home in 40 minutes, what is there to eat?’ The meals aren’t the same meals, the supermarket shopping isn’t the same shopping, the holidays aren’t the same holidays, the trips abroad are just an escape. The world isn’t the same without you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

When the Hamas terrorist attack began, the two women initially hid together in nearby bushes, but eventually, Gili saw Romi get shot and ran for help, but was unable to get back and try and save her, according to Channel 13.\nRomi’s body was eventually identified on October 11. She was buried the next day in Pardesiya.\nShe is survived by her four children — Ariel, 19, Shira, 17, and Liam, 9, who she had with her ex-husband, Motti Eliyahu — and Emma, 1, who she shared with her girlfriend, Suzi.\nGili told Maariv that “everyone who knew [Romi] personally was in love with [her] and [her] energy.”\n“In the name of all your friends, I promise that everyone will hear and know about you and what you went through. You were my light, you always will be. There’s a you-shaped hole in my heart and it will stay there forever,” she said.\nRomi grew up in an ultra-Orthodox family, and lost her mother at a young age, according to Ynet. After her father struggled to raise her and her siblings, she went into foster care. When she was just 18, Romi married Motti, who also grew up Haredi, and the couple had their first two children while living in the ultra-Orthodox city of Modiin Illit.\nThe couple both started to have doubts about their Haredi lifestyle and slowly moved away from it, ultimately moving to the nearby Modiin, where they had their third child. Around five years ago, Romi realized that she was attracted to women, and she and Motti parted ways amicably. Romi then met Suzi, and the couple decided to bring Emma into the world together.\n“Romi fulfilled herself, she lived exactly as she wanted to live,” Motti told Ynet. “More than anything else she wanted to be a mom.” She was “beautiful, charismatic, social, and very authentic… it was only during the shiva that I understood how significant she had been in the lives of so many people.”\nIn the wake of Romi’s death, Motti and Suzi made the unusual decision to move into together and raise Romi’s four children in a shared apartment, something they said they felt she would be overjoyed by.\nWriting on Facebook on Emma’s second birthday in May 2024, Suzi said she was celebrating “with a huge missing piece that is an inseparable part of your life. That is suddenly gone.”\n“My girl, the longing for your second mom is inseparable, the endless love between you two was always there, it was always moving to see it from the side,” she added. “I want you to know that your mother is always with you, no matter what. She is up above, loving and embracing and celebrating you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Avraham Munder, 79, was kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, along with his wife, daughter and grandson.\nHis son, Roee Munder, was murdered in the attack.\nAvraham’s wife, Ruti, his daughter Keren and grandson Ohad were freed from captivity in late November. Upon their release, they found out that Avraham had been kidnapped and not murdered, as they had feared, after they had seen him forced to kneel on the ground while they were driven away.\nIn late August 2024, Avraham’s body was recovered by IDF troops from a tunnel in Khan Younis, and returned to Israel, along with those of Alex Dancyg, Yagev Buchshtav, Chaim Peri, Yoram Metzger and Nadav Popplewell.\nUntil his body was recovered, his family had held out hope that he was still alive. His family was later informed that he had likely been killed in March 2024, shot dead by his captors.\nAvraham was buried on August 21, 2024, in Kibbutz Nir Oz in a joint ceremony alongside the reburial of his son, Roee, who had initially been laid to rest in Kibbutz Metzer in October 2023, without any of his immediate family present. Avraham is survived by his wife, Ruti, daughter, Keren and siblings Arye and Shoshi.\nBorn and raised in Givatayim, he came to the kibbutz as part of a pioneer youth group to establish and develop the community. There he met Ruti, and they remained together in the home they loved for close to six decades. A kibbutz eulogy said that Avraham had worked at the Nirlat factory and was “known for his warm nature and deep love of singing… we will forever remember Avraham for his clear voice, warm smile, and boundless love for his family and kibbutz.”\nAt his funeral, Avraham’s sister, Shoshi Ben Ezra, said she couldn’t understand how her “sensitive and kind-hearted brother, a man of labor and peace, whose love for his kibbutz and his country flowed was in his blood, spent the last months of his life in a tunnel with the feelings of abandonment and betrayal.”\nHis daughter, Keren, said that “Roee and I were just two siblings, but Mom and Dad hosted and took care of dozens of young people from Israel and abroad with a wide heart and openness — immigrants, adoptees, volunteers, new families, everyone fell in love with you, with your kindness, your sociability.”\n“You were a modest and direct dad, pedantic and organized, never leaving any task for tomorrow, hardworking, alarmingly precise,” she wrote. “A dad who knew so much, English and French and even math. A dad who played ball and marbles with me, who brought me a stamp album… with the warmest embrace, the highest sensitivity, the best listener, acceptance, unconditional love.”\nHer son, Ohad, “turned you into the happiest grandfather, he got to receive huge doses of love from you, you would enjoy just watching him sleep,” added Keren. “And you enjoyed every smart or funny sentence out of his mouth, taking pride in him and showing him off.” She wanted, she said, to remember not his health troubles and the horrible circumstances of his death, “but all our moments together, watching soccer games, rehearsals for choir, hearing your beautiful voice among all the others, reading us stories.”\nSpeaking at his funeral, his wife, Ruti, thanked him for the 62 years that they shared, “58 of which we lived together, a full life, together in harmony despite our differences.”\n“We did everything together, we raised children, we traveled around Israel and the world, we watched soccer games and Maccabi Tel Aviv basketball games and all that we did with love and respect… You were a hardworking and exacting man of labor. You loved to sing, you would take part in ceremonies and holiday gatherings and sometimes sing in different groups. You loved the songs of Nat King Cole and Arik Einstein and many others. You were so sensitive and there were songs that even moved you to tears.”\nRuti said Avraham “was a loving husband to me and a loving father to Keren and Roee. You were a war family man to the whole extended family. You accepted me as I am, you made me feel loved and appreciated.

    "story": "Cpt. Ori Mordechay Shani, 22, a platoon commander in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion, from Kiryat Arba, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the Kissufim IDF outpost.\nAt the start of the attack, Ori and five of his soldiers were on a routine patrol of the border. They began to fight against the invasion, but were underequipped. Ori’s brother, Yishai, told Ynet that he texted him that morning “pray for us, we have no ammo, no water.”\nAt 3:26 p.m., Yishai said, he texted Ori requesting a sign of life, and he responded “still alive.”\nAfter more than 8 hours battling near the border, during which they succeeded in killing many Hamas gunmen, Ori and his team returned to the Kissufim outpost to gather more ammunition, and there they were attacked with mortar fire which killed Ori on the spot as well as his soldier, Sgt. Reem Batito.\nHe was buried on October 10 on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. He is survived by his wife, Miriam, their son, Roi, 4 months, his parents, Shulamit and Yehoshua, and his six siblings, Nava, Bat-Zion, Yishai, Tzofia, Elisha and Malachi.\nBorn and raised in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, next to Hebron, Ori studied in a yeshiva in Ramat Gan before enlisting in the army. He served first in the Egoz commando unit before completing an officer’s course and taking a position in the Golani Brigade.\nHe had a love of reading, his family said, and even won a local reading competition in his youth. In his memory, his family is working to establish a library at a school in Modiin where two of his nephews study, writing that “Ori was interested in a wide range of genres, and was always proud of the knowledge he got from reading. As a father, he wanted to pass that on to the next generation.”\nAfter his death, his family said, they found some of his notebooks and writing in which he had contemplated his contributions to the country: “What do the people of Israel need the most from me now?” he wrote. “How can I, Ori Shani, the individual, get out of my box and become part of this wonderful nation, this extraordinary people?”\nHis wife, Miriam, told Army Radio that “Ori, as his name, was truly a huge light, he had a light that shone to all those around him, a smile that spread to everyone around him.”\nThe couple, who both grew up in Kiryat Arba, met in high school and started dating while he was in the army, marrying a year and a half before Ori was killed and settling in their hometown.\n“Ori always dreamed and aspired, he didn’t rest, he was a leader,” Miriam added. After he was killed, his family received his phone back “and we found a selfie of him smiling with his soldiers at 9:56 a.m. The soldiers who made it back alive told us that he ordered them to smile for the camera, he saw that they needed motivation and strength, and he told them he was sending the photo to their mothers so that they would be proud of them.”\n“That to me is a leader, full of courage, strength and spirit, who knew what his goal was,” she added. “He was always thinking about others… his last two words were ‘take cover.’ His concern for other people was always in his mind.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

For several days, her family searched for any sign of her until her body was identified.\nShe was buried in Tel Aviv and is survived by her parents, Irena and Alexander, brother Sergei and sister Dalia.\nShe had a bachelor’s degree in business and a master’s degree in administration from The College of Law and Business in Ramat Gan.\nDalia wrote in a eulogy that she and Olga were very close, and had even joked about going to a nursing home together when the time came. She said that Olga had been bullied in her childhood but had only used it to become stronger.\n“She looked like a skinny and beautiful girl, but in her personality, she was brave and knew how to handle herself with other people,” Dalia wrote, adding that Olga was very spiritual and loved astrology.\n“She taught me everything I know, she prepared me for every significant milestone in life and showed me so much love as her little sister,” Dalia wrote. “She helped me pass my first driving test, offered to move out of our parents’ house to a shared apartment and brought her cat, Cleo. She was my female role model, and thanks to her, I had high self-esteem and grew up fast.”\nOlga’s friend, Dolev, wrote in an online eulogy that she had been introduced to Olga and Dalia by their brother, Sergei, after she came back to Israel following a difficult divorce abroad and was lonely.\nDolev wrote that as soon as she entered Olga’s and Dalia’s apartment, “Olga’s magic made me feel that I was in the right place with the right person.”\nDespite being shy and nervous, Dolev said that “after two words from her, we started to talk and talk without stopping, and between the lines, she understood in the smartest, most intelligent and mature way that my words came from a deep place. Somehow, in those few minutes, I told her everything I had been through, and I felt such warmth, love, and acceptance, and I felt like she had adopted me.”\nFrom that moment on, Dolev wrote, Olga “always made sure to raise my confidence and let me know there was someone there for me.”\nOlga’s friend from the army, Chen, wrote that Olga was a “loyal, funny, sarcastic, and generous friend.”\n“She would tell me a lot about her family, and I felt how much she loved and appreciated them.

    "story": "Supt. Avi Zidon, 50, deputy head of the patrol unit at the Ofakim police station, from Yevul, was killed on October 7 battling Hamas terrorists next to the Pri Gan moshav.\nWith the start of the attack, Avi left his home in Yevul — a small moshav near the Gaza-Egypt border — shortly before 7 a.m., his wife told Zman Yisrael. She said they spoke only once more around 7:40 a.m., “when he was in the middle of battling terrorists and was calm as usual. He just said, ‘There are terrorists here right now, I can’t talk.'”\nOn his way to the Ofakim station, Avi had encountered the security chief of the group of 12 small towns in that area, including Yevul and Pri Gan, who told him of the extensive terrorist invasion. Avi agreed to join him in battling the Hamas gunmen who had invaded Pri Gan, and they and another police officer began to engage them in a firefight.\nWhen the other officer was wounded, Avi insisted on staying in Pri Gan alone to battle the terrorists while the security chief evacuated the wounded officer. He was shot dead shortly afterward.\n“I know that he wouldn’t have done anything differently,” his wife told Zman Yisrael. “Even if he would have known ahead of time what the ultimate outcome would be, he would have behaved exactly the same. He told me while he was alive that he was ready to sacrifice his life for others.”\nLater, a number of local security members from the surrounding towns joined the fight in Pri Gan and three were killed in the firefight — Reouven Chicheportiche, Aviad Cohen and Bechor Swid — but all of the other residents survived.\nAvi was buried on October 11 in Kibbutz Gvulot. He is survived by his wife Efrat, two children, Roni, 14, and Eyal, 11, and his brother, Adi.\nEfrat told Zman Yisrael, “At least he didn’t die in vain. At least there was value and meaning to his death. He had a huge heart and he devoted himself to his police officers. They can say that he was the most available commander, the most straightforward, the most moral. He was a man who set goals and achieved them.”\nAmir Peleg, his friend from high school, told Zman, “I have a heroic friend called Avi. I have a friend who walked with eyes wide open toward his death, and in that protected and saved a whole town that was at risk of a massacre. I have a friend who knew what he was sacrificing and chose to sacrifice it. I have a friend who loved life, loved his wife and his kids and still chose to remain alone against dozens of terrorists. We always knew, us on the kibbutz, that Avi was a hero.”\nBorn in Holon, at age 11 Avi arrived at Kibbutz Gvulot to live in a youth village for at-risk children, according to a local eulogy. He was a big reader, and even as a child was into learning about history, particularly wars and military strategy.\nThe eulogy said that from a young age, he dreamed about a career in the security field, and served as a combat soldier in the Kfir Brigade’s Duchifat Battalion.\nAfter his release, he got a degree in history from Ben Gurion University, while working in Gvulot to fund his studies, according to a kibbutz eulogy.  In 2002, he enlisted in the Israel Police, serving in the southern district and rising through the ranks.\nHe later got a master’s degree at the University of Haifa, and he and his family moved around for many years in conjunction with his studies and his job. In 2012, they returned to live in Kibbutz Gvulot, and in 2019 they settled in Yevul, where they build their dream house.\nHe was a devoted family man, and in his spare time, he loved to read and exercise, particularly long-distance running — completing the Tel Aviv Marathon — and basketball, including coaching a local youth team.\nAccording to the kibbutz eulogy, “His children were a dream come true for him and his whole world. He always found time to plan and to take family trips around Israel… His family was always his top priority and he made sure they were never lacking anything.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 253 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Sivan Simha Asraf, 20, a signals soldier from Ashkelon, was killed on October 7 when Hamas terrorists overran the Nahal Oz IDF base.\nSivan had enlisted in the IDF in October 2021, serving in the Teleprocessing Corps, and that weekend was slated to be her last on base before being released. Sivan and Staff Sgt. Shahaf Nissani, who was serving on the same base and also about to complete her mandatory service, had planned out their whole final weekend together on base with food and celebrations.\nThey awoke to the sound of sirens at 6:30 a.m. and ran to the on-base bomb shelter. But they quickly realized that this was not just a rocket attack, but there were Hamas gunmen inside the base. Sivan spoke to her mother from a friend’s phone and told her, “Mom, there’s a terrorist invasion, I love you.”\nHer family said that they later learned from others on base that Sivan was killed while trying to run for safety from the bomb shelter, which had been attacked by the Hamas invaders. Shahaf was also slain that day.\nSivan was buried on October 12 in Ashkelon. She is survived by her parents, Osnat and Itzik, and her siblings Tair and Yahli.\nAn online eulogy noted that Sivan was very close to her older and younger sisters, and had several hobbies — reading, listening to music and working out at the gym. She also loved keeping things neat and organized, including her room on base, which she decorated to add a homey touch.\nSivan’s sister, Tair, wrote, “My beautiful sister, the best girl in the world, a little angel who left too soon.”\n“So kind, gentle, beautiful, full of joy and a rolling laugh, always put together and organized,” she added. “There’s nobody who wouldn’t say how kind you were, you always loved to help and volunteer, you loved to give of yourself to others, sought peace and gave everyone the benefit of the doubt. You loved to make peace between people and resolve arguments. I love you forever, my other half, the most beautiful and pure soul in the world.”\nHer mother, Osnat, told a local news outlet that “Sivan was a beautiful girl, she loved life, she was happy and joyous. She had a contagious and bashful laughter, she loved to smile, she was kind, loved to help everyone. She had a heart of gold.”\nOsnat said that there was “no soldier who asked her for help and she didn’t help them. I remember when a new soldier showed up to the base and was a little shy, Sivan took her for a tour of the base and showed her everything and introduced her to everyone, took her everywhere.”\nSivan, she said, “forgave everyone and never held a grudge, everyone loved her, she was magnetic. All the soldiers loved her, she had fun there together. That was Sivan — magnetic, smiling, happy — that’s how I want her to be remembered.”\nOsnat said Sivan was still figuring out what she wanted to do with her life, and had so many dreams that were cut short.\n“She was only 20, and naturally she was debating which way to go,” she said. “On the one hand, she loved the army and wanted to re-up, and at the same time, she wanted to study interior design, understand real estate appraisal, learn English, take a long trip to New York. She wanted to do so many things.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

According to Eden’s mother, the pair sought safety in a roadside bomb shelter near Kibbutz Be’eri.\nIdan told her that when the situation calmed down, he was planning on driving to his aunt in Kibbutz Be’eri, but when she told him that the kibbutz was overrun by terrorists, they decided to stay inside the shelter. There, both Eden and Idan were murdered along with many others when the Hamas terrorists threw grenades and opened fire on those huddled inside.\nIdan was buried in Palmachim on October 12. He is survived by his parents, Avri and Revital and his younger sisters Nofar and Noa.\nHe was the nephew of Nira Herman Sharabi, whose husband, Yossi, was abducted from Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7 and was killed in Hamas captivity. Yossi’s brother, Eli Sharabi, is believed to still be held captive, and Eli’s wife and daughters, Lianne, Noiya and Yahel, were all murdered.\nAfter graduating from the Brenner school in Kibbutz Givat Brenner, Idan served in the IDF as a combat soldier. Later, he volunteered as a mentor at the Front Life organization, which helps former combat soldiers transition into civilian life.\nHis friend and fellow volunteer, Iar Danon, memorialized him on the organization’s website, saying that he was a person who was “always with a massive smile, captivating blue eyes, and endless charisma.”\nIdan loved the sea, surfing and other water sports, and was about to begin his second year studying electrical engineering at the Afeka College in Tel Aviv.\nHis friends and family wrote on Facebook that he had been a curious child with an “incredible” sense of humor.\n“He had a wonderful connection between external beauty that could not be ignored and internal beauty that made everyone who knew him just want to be around him,” they wrote, adding that he loved to travel both in Israel and abroad.\nThey went on to write that “Idan was the one who connected friends from all his circles. He maintained good and close relationships with everyone, initiated get-togethers, and always made sure to be in communication with everyone.”\nBelle Asher, a friend of Idan’s from school, wrote on Instagram that he was “the most special guy, the one who everyone liked, the one who taught me to persevere, the one who shouted at me from the window that he loved me, the one who knew how to be a real friend.”\nHis former co-worker, Matan Or Hen, wrote that they first clicked when he talked about surfing. “Your eyes lit up and I couldn’t wait to work with you. I had only taken up surfing and you wanted to teach me. Thank you for being there for me and for all the good times we’ve had. You’ll always remain in my heart.”\nIdan’s aunt, Gali Herman Goshen, eulogized him on Facebook as a “handsome guy, a charming boy, smart, with an appetite for life, an angel with values, who was always surrounded by countless friends.”\nIdan was a caring son and a loving brother to his two younger sisters, a connection “built on humor and lots of intelligence, a passion for life, deep love and care for each other,” Gali wrote.\n“The world won’t return to what it once was, because without you it won’t be the same,” she added. “You will always be in our hearts, our memories, our thoughts and our longings.

    "story": "Cpl. Ilay Azar, 18, a soldier in the Gaza Division, from Tel Aviv, was killed battling Hamas on October 7.\nHe was stationed that weekend at the Re’im military base, the headquarters of the IDF Gaza Division. At 7:20 that morning he told his father that there was gunfire and chaos and he would speak to him later. That was the last time he heard from him.\nStaff Sgt. Ido Horovitz, who fought alongside Ilay that day, told Israel Hayom that despite being new on base, “He was focused. He didn’t think twice, didn’t worry what would happen to him or what the consequences would be, he was focused on fighting, to do as much as he could and to save as many people as he could.”\nAmid the battle against Hamas gunmen who had invaded the base, Ilay was shot twice and killed. Among those also killed fighting on the base were Lt. Col. Sahar Machlof, Maj. Ido Yehoshua and Cpt. Rom Shlomi.\nIlay was buried in Tel Aviv on October 11. He is survived by his parents, Dave and Efrat, and his sister Amit, 16.\nIlay had only enlisted in the IDF in March 2023, around six months before he was killed, and had only finished his basic training a few weeks earlier. He was interviewed on Channel 12 news on the day of his enlistment, for a story about those joining combat units amid the backlash over the judicial overhaul. Ilay told the network that he felt “like there will be a war here soon. There is chaos and the people who are supposed to make less chaos are making more chaos.”\nIlay surrounded himself with music, his loved ones said, including writing songs and DJing — even bringing his turntable and a speaker to the IDF base. After his death, his family released a song he wrote and recorded with a friend, called “La’uf el Hashamayim” (Fly to the Heavens). He also loved surfing and hanging out at the beach with friends, as well as dancing and partying, his loved ones said.\nIdo Suliman, who was Ilay’s guidance counselor in high school, told Israel Hayom that “fate made us realize that Ilay accomplished so much in his life, he must have realized that time was short. He had to do as much as possible, play as much music as possible and get to know as many musical styles as possible.”\nIdo said their relationship was one of “love and education. We had a lot of conversations — Ilay was a very smart kid for his age, I told him that when he was alive as well… He was always many steps ahead, when something was explained to him he understood it already and he got bored easily. Music was the center of his life, not just playing it but also in his appearance, he would change looks and identities a lot, like dressing like a rapper. He was a star in the making.”\nIlay’s father, Dave, wrote on Facebook a month after he was killed that “I want to scream from the physical pain of a limb being cut off.”\n“You were a mensch, a good and loving person, talented, the best version you could be, in life and in the way it ended,” he continued. “A musician, a surfer, a man of spirit and freedom, a man of parties and living at a rapid pace.”\nDave wrote, “You chose at the end to be the best man you could be, the most brave and calm. I’ll admire you forever. I’m sad over the things we didn’t get to do, I’m thankful for every day and every hour and every minute that you were with me, that you were with us.”\nInstead of “buying a plane ticket to the Far East, instead of marrying you off, we meet at your grave… I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 256 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

A later video showed them being dragged through a gap in the concrete wall into Gaza.\nOn December 14, 2023, IDF troops recovered Nik’s body from a tunnel in northern Gaza along with those of Elia Toledano and Sgt. Ron Sherman.\nTamir Nimrodi, a soldier who was taken captive with Nik and Ron, is believed to still be held hostage in Gaza.\nAn IDF investigation published in September 2024 revealed that Nik, Elia and Ron were killed on November 10, 2023, as a result of a “byproduct” of an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip, likely indicating that they suffocated or were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning inside a tunnel.\nNik was buried on December 17, 2023, in Beersheba. He is survived by his parents, Katya and Sergey, his younger sister Nikol and his girlfriend, Marta.\nBorn and raised in Beersheba, Nik loved animals from a young age, trained in martial arts as a child and was an active gym-goer as a teenager. He loved to sing, especially karaoke, to cook for his friends, and was especially handy around the house, his family said. He also loved cars, and would sometimes go out drifting with friends in the desert.\nNik had only enlisted in the IDF in late April 2023, less than six months before he was kidnapped. On July 1, after finishing basic training, he was stationed at the base next to Erez.\nAt his funeral, his father, Sergey, said that he “was raised and lived in love. No matter what, you will stay alive to us, and stay loved. I know that everything we felt toward you was only joy and love. You somehow succeeded, you never disappointed us even once. I know that you love us, and you will continue to love us and protect us in the future.”\nHis sister, Nikol, said, “You were a good brother, you did all the right things. You always told me what was right and what was wrong, you hugged me a lot… I’m asking you to visit me in my dreams so we can talk. You always said I didn’t need to worry about you.”\n“I will achieve all of my and your dreams, as you always wanted,” she added. “I’ll take care of your girlfriend because I know how much you love her.”\nSpeaking at a ceremony marking one year since October 7, Nik’s mother, Katya, said “I miss you. I miss your strong hug, your wide shoulders.”\n“I miss your wonderful and captivating smile and the simple things that were just ours — texting each morning, our messages,” she said. “I still send you, ‘Good morning, my boy, take care of yourself,’ except now you no longer answer.”\n“I miss cooking together. I always asked you what you wanted me to make and you said, ‘Nothing, I want us to cook together,’ and then we’d make all your favorite tasty things,” Katya continued. “I miss the big things, the mess you would always leave behind you, the lights you would leave on everywhere in the house because for a year there is darkness everywhere.”\n“I miss the noise in the house, the parties with friends, the karaoke, to hear you sing, to see you happy,” she added. “Because the quiet that you left behind is awful. I miss the laundry on the weekends, how I would wash and iron the green uniform with pride. I miss so many things — a whole evening is not enough to say them all, but most of all I miss you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Moriya Raviv, 23, from Kiryat Motzkin, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nShe attended the rave with her friends Ziv Frenkel and Lin Dafni, both of whom were also slain that day.\nMoriya went to the rave to celebrate her 23rd birthday, which fell on October 8. When the rocket fire began, she called her mother to say she was heading home as the festival was canceled, but that was the last her family heard from her.\nShe was buried outside Haifa on October 10. She is survived by her parents, Sima and Meir, and her younger siblings Roie and Shira.\nMoriya grew up in the Haifa area, and in high school she was an active youth guide for school trips as well as a volunteer firefighter. During her mandatory military service, Moriya served as a drone instructor in the Intelligence Collection Corps, and after her release she moved to Eilat for more than a year to work and save up money for her travels.\nShe spent around five months traveling by herself around South America, and had returned to Israel not long before the Supernova rave, ready to start planning the next steps in her young life.\nHer childhood friend, May Schechter, wrote on Instagram about their years of friendship, starting at age 10, and staying strong through “every birthday, every year-end school trip, the trip to Poland, every time we wanted to dress up and drink wine in the Carmel, to get coffee at sunset and to gossip for hours on the balcony.”\nMay wrote that it was impossible to sum up Moriya in words: “You are the most iconic, funny, random, crazy, impulsive, super anxious but the most brave person I know. You never give up until you achieve what you wanted, like switching jobs three times in the army or getting up and walking away from people who weren’t suited to you.”\n“I miss our nonsense, our laughter, our Saturday night shopping trips,” she added. “It’s so not fair that you’re no longer here. It’s hard to think with every step what you would have said, what you would have done, what you would have felt, instead of you simply being here so I could hear you. It’s not fair that we won’t make any more memories together.”\nMoriya’s mother, Sima, told a local Haifa news site that “Moriya was the prettiest girl in kindergarten, she always brought light everywhere she went. Wherever she was, there was so much light.”\nShe loved to travel and to follow her own path, said Sima: “She loved the feeling of freedom.”\nEven a year after Moriya’s death, her mother said, “I wake up every morning to October 7… We try to be strong, but for us it is always October 7.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Yuval Ben Yakov, 21, a soldier in the 7th Armored Brigade, from Kibbutz Kfar Menahem, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nYuval was stationed at the Yiftah IDF outpost next to Zikim when the Hamas attack began. His girlfriend, Roni, who was stationed on the same base, told Ynet that they were both awakened by the sirens and rockets, and met in the on-base bomb shelter.\nRoni was barefoot, and Yuval gave her his flip flops so she wouldn’t hurt her feet, she said. After about half an hour, Yuval was called to the gate of the base to provide backup against the terror infiltration. There, barefoot and in pajamas, he battled against the terrorists and was slain in the firefight along with Cpl. Naama Bony, Staff Sgt. Ido Harush, Sgt. Ilay Bar Sadeh, Lt. Yoav Malayev and Sgt. Nathanel Young.\nYuval was buried on October 9 in Kfar Menahem. He is survived by his parents, Haim (Vitaly) and Emilia, and his older sister Ethel.\nBorn in Jerusalem, when Yuval was two his family moved overseas as part of his mother’s role as a Jewish Agency emissary and his father’s role as director-general of the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress, posted in Russia. When he was 7, he, his mother and sister moved back to Israel and settled in Kfar Menahem in the south, according to an IDF eulogy. As a young child, he underwent heart surgery, but never let it hold him back in life, his family said.\nYuval loved music and dancing at parties, and as a teen started working at McDonald’s on weekends, eventually being promoted to deputy manager. Serving a significant combat role was important to Yuval, and when he was told that being overweight would hold him back, he pushed off his enlistment date and lost 33kg within 3 months with the help of a personal trainer, ultimately enlisting in January 2021 and being placed in the 77th Battalion of the 7th Armored Brigade, according to a local kibbutz eulogy. His mandatory army service was slated to end on October 18, but Yuval had agreed to stay on for four additional months at the request of his battalion commander.\nHe met his girlfriend, Roni, while serving together on the same base in 2023, and they quickly became a couple. Roni wrote online that “over the past six months you were the closest person to me, my partner, the friend I told everything to, the friend I fell in love with and wanted to be as close to as possible.”\n“Thank you, my prince,” she added. “Thank you that I got to experience your love in the best way, thank you for always being there for me, thank you for choosing me to be yours, thank you for protecting me until the last moment. You are mine and I am yours for life.”\nIn an interview with Channel 12 news, his sister, Ethel, said that Yuval “would always tell me, ‘You’re my sister, I love you and I’ll take care of you.’ That’s the thought I wake up with every day once I understand that the whole thing wasn’t just a nightmare.”\nHis grandmother said it was impossible to comprehend “that I won’t see him again, that he won’t walk in here with the most beautiful smile in the world.”\nIn a local eulogy, his mother, Emilia described him as a “sweet and easy baby.” The family’s return to Israel at age 7 was hard, she said, but Yuval eventually learned the language and made friends. He “enjoyed the group in the kibbutz, and started to go to local club events, connect to the counselors and join the shared activities.”\nHe didn’t love being in a school setting, she said, but applied himself when he needed to in order to pass all of his exams. He thrived in the army she said, and when he would come home on breaks, “he’d give up on his sleep even when he came home exhausted in favor of meeting with his friends, who were so important to him, and he always returned from their gatherings happy and joyous.”\nEmilia asked to remember her son as “golden-haired and blue-eyed, smart and strong, a sensitive and straightforward guy.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 259 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Salomon Iliaguev, 28, from Sderot, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in the city on October 7.\nSalomon had just finished an overnight shift as a security guard when the rocket fire began, and with a group of others he sought safety in a gas station in Sderot as terrorists roamed around right outside, smashing the glass door of the gas station shop. Fearing that his wife and children were in danger, Salomon decided to leave the gas station and head home.\n“I saw him and I said that something was going on. I told him, ‘Don’t go outside,'” recounted a survivor from inside the gas station to Channel 13 news. “And he said to me, ‘My wife and kids are waiting for me at home.'”\nHis wife said they spoke and “he told me he was on his way home. But he never arrived.” Salomon left the gas station and tried to get home, but was shot dead by Hamas terrorists in the street.\nHe was buried in Sderot and is survived by his wife, Yulia, their two children, Adele and Shalev, and his two siblings.\nBorn in Ashkelon and raised in Sderot in a family which traced its roots to the Caucusus region, Salomon also spent a period living in Canada as a child before returning to Israel. He ran his own car wash business and also worked nights as a security guard. Cars were his major passion, and he wanted to expand his work in the auto field.\nHis childhood friend, Julia Abramov, wrote on Facebook about how they “grew up together from age 0 in Israel and then I moved to Canada, and six months later you and your family moved to Canada — what were the chances?”\nThey moved in next door, with adjoining balconies, “the same school, the same class, and all of our childhood and adolescence we went through together until you went back to Israel,” she wrote. “When I’m asked about my childhood there isn’t a single situation or story you weren’t in. We were the best of friends, you always watched over me like a little sister, you were always my secret keeper.”\nRecalling his love of cars from a young age, Julia recounted getting caught taking a joyride in her father’s new Mercedes when they were 13 years old — and him jumping in to take the blame for her: “We were such troublemakers!… you were such a huge part of my life, my heart can’t stop bleeding and crying.”\n“I want to tell you that I’m proud of you, of who you were and what you achieved. You were a loyal husband and the best father there was,” she added. “Everything is different here without you.”\nSalomon’s wife, Yulia wrote on Facebook on what would have been his 29th birthday.\n“My love, I can’t believe and accept the reality we are in,” she wrote. “We were supposed to celebrate your 29th birthday and now we are here without you celebrating you. I brought you the cheesecake you loved so much, which you would ask me to buy you every week and I would laugh at you and say you had the cravings of a pregnant woman.”\n“It’s hard for me to live without you,” Yulia added. “It’s hard for the kids without you. How will we survive a whole life now? We miss you so much. I hope that things are good for you up above and at least you can celebrate with your parents after so many years without them. You’ll remain 28 forever, a flower picked before your time.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Dolev Amouyal, 21, a soldier in the Golani Brigade from Netanya, was killed by a Hamas rocket near the Nahal Oz IDF outpost on October 7.\nWith the start of the Hamas invasion down south, Dolev, who was home for the weekend, convinced his father to drive him to Ashdod so he could head toward the Nahal Oz outpost, where he was normally stationed. In Ashdod he caught a ride to go and join the fighting, and first reached the nearby Paga outpost where he helped to evacuate those wounded.\nLater in the day, he was heading in a jeep toward Nahal Oz to join his comrades, when a rocket hit the vehicle and a piece of shrapnel pierced his heart, killing him, his family said.\nJust before he was killed, his father said, Dolev wrote messages to his parents, his girlfriend and his grandmother telling him that he loved them. Dolev, who had enlisted in the IDF in March 2021, was killed two weeks before he was slated to be released.\nHe was buried on October 12 in Netanya. He is survived by his parents, Yaniv and Yael, and his brother Or.\nMere days before he was killed, Dolev changed his WhatsApp status to, “He who makes joy a habit, never falls into depression,” which his family said summed up the way he saw the world. They put the sentence on his gravestone.\nOn a memorial page for Dolev, his mother Yael wrote that he “loved everyone, had a light in his eyes, always united people around him, and helped everyone.”\nSpeaking to a local news site, Yael said she could barely talk about Dolev, “I can’t even say out loud that my wonderful, special boy is no longer here.”\n“It’s unfathomable that our Dolev, who loved everyone, who had light in his eyes, he was always surrounded by people, who helped everyone — his friends, his family, the elderly who needed help on the bus, at the crosswalk with bags — who was always there, will never give me another hug again.”\nHis father Yaniv told the Kan public broadcaster that “he was a very unique kid. Handsome, full of light, happy and smiling — there’s no photo in which he isn’t smiling.”\n“Everyone who met him loved him from the first moment,” added Yaniv. “He was a leader from birth. His loss is enormous and has crushed all of us. We are a very united family, he was the oldest son and the oldest grandson.”\nNot long before he was killed, Yaniv said he managed to speak to Dolev one last time on the phone, “and during that conversation, he told me, ‘Dad, you need to go be with Mom and with Or.

    "story": "Ram “Rami” Negbi, 57, from Kibbutz Ein Hashlosha, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the kibbutz.\nAs chief of the kibbutz’s local security team, he was posthumously recognized by the Defense Ministry as a fallen soldier with the rank of major in the reserves.\nThe morning of the attack, Rami wrote to the other members of the local security squad that something unusual was happening, and they should gather with their weapons at a central location, according to Israel Hayom.\nHis wife said he left the house around 7 a.m. and never returned.\nNot long after he messaged the other members of the team, Rami reported that he had encountered a cell of terrorists. He was killed in the firefight and the terrorists stole his weapon.\nRami was one of four people slain that morning in the kibbutz, along with Silvia Mirensky, Noa Glazberg and Marcelle Taljah.\nHis funeral was held in Eilat on October 31, and he was buried in Ein Hashlosha. He is survived by his wife, Lydia, their two daughters, Sunshine and Noy, his three siblings, Dror, Anat and Hila, and two grandchildren.\nRami, who was born in Bat Yam, had lived in Ein Hashlosha for many years, and served as the head of its local security team for close to 20 years. He met and married Lydia, a native of the Philippines, raising together her daughter, Sunshine and their shared daughter, Noy.\nIn an interview with a local news site in 2018, Rami spoke about the immense sense of responsibility he felt as head of security: “I live, breathe and feel this responsibility, all of my thoughts are focused on ensuring that nobody gets hurt… I’ll do everything to make sure nobody gets hurt.”\nRami said he felt that the rest of the country had no idea what was really going on with the communities around Gaza: “There have been rockets, mortars, wars — those who live outside of rocket range live in a different reality, they totally don’t understand how much it affects us.”\nBut most of the time he said, the upticks in violence are short, “and we live quietly, building our lives — and the rest of the nation is welcome to visit us, come stay here and get to know us up close.”\nA kibbutz eulogy described Rami as “our mythological security chief, the right man, a partner in action. A talented musician. The most magical and inspirational man in the world. Always smiling. Always with the warmest and most accurate words. Always there for us. Our hero — in life and death.”\nHis stepdaughter, Sunshine, wrote on Facebook on what would have been his 58th birthday, of her longing to “go back to the kibbutz and for you to complain that we’re making noise.”\n“I want to annoy you and tell you about all of my ideas and for you to tell me how insane I am,” she continued. “I want for you to make us a barbecue again because a day before the [Hamas attack] the meat you made us was dry.”\n“You weren’t my father, but you gave me a new life, you were as proud of me as any father who is proud of his daughter, you didn’t need to say it but I knew that you loved me and you always took care of me exactly like any father would,” added Sunshine.\nShe said that he would often ask her, “‘So what are we doing?’ and I would always answer, ‘I don’t know.’ And now I really don’t know… What do you do when the most important figure in your life leaves and is never coming back?”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 262 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Ofir Melman, 21, a combat medic in the Nahal Brigade’s reconnaissance battalion, from Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak, was killed on October 7 while treating soldiers wounded during the Hamas invasion of the Kibbutz Sufa IDF outpost.\nWhen the invasion began, Ofir decided not to enter the protected area in the kibbutz but to go outside and treat wounded soldiers of the Nahal Brigade’s 50th Battalion.\nStaff Sgt. Gali Shakotai and Sgt. Nahman Dekel provided cover as he was doing so, but they were all ultimately slain in the fighting.\nOfir is survived by his parents, Linda and Ilan, his sisters, Gal, Shani, and Talia, and his twin brother Lior. He was buried in Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak, whose founders include Ofir’s grandparents.\nAfter being posted in Kibbutz Sufa, right near his home in the Nir Yitzhak, he used to walk to his post every day and bring home-cooked meals to his fellow fighters. Only two days before he was killed, he had come home to take meat for a barbecue with his friends. That was the last time he saw his family, according to a memorial page on a Nahal Brigade site.\nBefore being conscripted into the military, Ofir had been participating in a gap-year program in which he served as a youth instructor in Pardes Hanna. They called him “the King,” because of his exemplary conduct and the role model he provided, the site said.\nIn his spare time, he would produce large-scale parties in his kibbutz, at which he would also sometimes serve as the DJ. An amateur barber, Ofir would give his entire staff haircuts while they were at the military base. He would conduct conversations with them while cutting their hair and in this way forged deep, lasting friendships with each of them.\nOfir’s parents said that when his friends came to visit, each one would describe him as their best friend, showing how the deep connections he had made with those around him.\nHe was a devoted fan of the Hapoel Tel Aviv soccer team, which extended condolences to the family upon his death.\n“Ofir was always happy and smiling,” a post by the club said. “Every Saturday, when he was home, he was either at a party or at a Hapoel game, or both. He was happy and made others happy that way, always looking for new adventures and looking out for his friends. He was thrilled at every little win by Hapoel, and while he was not able to attend the latest match, his friends will continue going for him. He will join them from above.

    "story": "Liraz Nisan, 20, from Karmiel, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while trying to flee the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nLiraz attended the rave with her best friend, Sofia Bongart. When the rocket fire began, they fled via car and decided to stop and seek safety in a bomb shelter near Kibbutz Be’eri.\nIn her final texts around 8 a.m., Liraz begged a relative to call the police and said they were hiding in the shelter and trying to stay quiet. Liraz and Sofia were both murdered alongside many others when the terrorists threw grenades inside the bomb shelter and opened fire on the partygoers.\nLiraz was buried in Karmiel on October 13. She is survived by her parents, Ronit and Nadav, and her younger brother Liron.\nShe had recently finished her army service, and had hoped to continue to university, according to a state eulogy.\nHer younger brother, Liron, wrote on an Instagram memorial page that “the hole that opened in my heart will never be filled.”\n“You, my love, my dear, were pure, a magical soul, you knew how to give only love. Anger and hatred were wasted emotions to you,” he wrote. “You always spread light and joy. You held on to life with both hands, embraced life, enjoyed life.”\nLiron said he was struggling to understand “how I can continue without you, with the knowledge that you won’t be a part of my life any longer. You’re my other half, my best friend, my only sister. You always worried about me, called to check up on me… My one prayer is that you didn’t suffer, you weren’t afraid, that you knew how much we all love you and will miss you forever.”\nIn a eulogy on her high school website, Liraz’s mother, Ronit, wrote that “everyone loved you an abnormal amount! Of course — how could they not? The smile never left your face.”\nLiraz could be characterized best by “her constant, shy smile. Loving others was for her the highest value. She had friends of all kinds. Liraz always found the positives in everyone and didn’t focus on the flaws.”\nA quiet, shy kid, as a teenager, “She blossomed,” her mother wrote. “She changed. She loved to be around people, was always with her friends, wanted things to be happy and interesting.”\nShe loved to mark her birthday in a big way, said Ronit. “She would celebrate for a full week — it was a real holiday for her… Liraz’s motto in life was that you need to celebrate life at every opportunity.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Cpt. Iftah Yavetz, 23, a commander in the elite Maglan commando unit, from Ramat Hasharon, was killed battling the Hamas invasion near Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7.\nIftah was home in Ramat Hasharon at the start of the Hamas attack, and without waiting for orders decided to head down south to the frontlines, and along the way to connect with other Maglan fighters. His father said when Iftah was on his way down south, they briefly spoke, and he said “there’s huge chaos, dozens of terrorists inside Israel, we’ll talk later.”\nAround noon, the soldiers arrived at the entrance to Kibbutz Nahal Oz, which they had heard was under heavy attack. While on the way, Iftah sent a text message to kibbutz security chief Ilan Fiorentino, without knowing that he had already been killed, which read: “Ilan, this is Iftah Yavetz, the operations commander of Maglan. Stay strong, we’re on the way to you.”\nReaching the outskirts of the kibbutz, they fought a fierce battle against the Hamas invaders, and Iftah, Maj. Chen Bochris and Staff Sgt. Afik Rosenthal, all of Maglan, were slain in the firefight.\nIftah was buried in Tel Aviv on October 9. He is survived by his parents, Shira and Gilad, and his five half-siblings, Michal, 19, Tamar, 18, Yael, 17, Ella, 15, and Dan, 14.\nA talented pianist and an accomplished tennis player, he was ranked third in the country, but chose to put sports aside and focus on a serious military career. He enlisted in early 2019, and worked his way up to being a commander in the elite Maglan unit after completing an officer’s course.\nGilad, Iftah’s father, told Calcalist in an interview that his son “was very unique and deep in how he looked at life. He read a lot, he wrote a lot, he had a lot of meaningful relationships with people, he experienced love… he lived a short but very full life.”\nHe and Iftah, he said, “were close on the deepest level possible, the way we spoke and wrote and also without words. We said how much we loved each other and learned from each other. So I wasn’t left with the feeling of ‘why didn’t I tell him.'”\nIftah grew up with two sets of parents, he said, after each of his parents remarried, “and he was very close to all four of us. He came to the conclusion that family is the most important thing. He extended this also to his team in the army — the team is everything.”\nIftah’s mother, Shira, said in an IDF memorial article that the pair had developed a tradition, where every Shabbat which he would spend on base, they would send each other a song or a poem or a text that had meaning: “It was usually poems, but sometimes songs, quotes from books or beautiful prose,” she said. “Every week I would look for poems on all sorts of topics, and Iftah would send one back. I was always surprised that he had time to look.”\nShira made a book of all their exchanges when he completed his officer’s course, and after his death printed more copies of it for his loved ones: “A lot of people who served with Iftah didn’t know that side of him. He was a tough and serious fighter, they didn’t know he also had a poetic soul.”\n“Iftah had wonderful language. He was a person who gave a lot of value to the written word,” she added. “He always had a book in his bag, even when he headed out to very difficult weeks in the army he would take a book with him. It always amazed me that even when his comrades didn’t have time to shower, he would find time to read.”\nAfter Iftah was killed, his parents were given a letter he had written three months earlier, ahead of a complicated IDF operation in the West Bank, from which he thought he might not emerge alive.\nHe and his comrades, he wrote, were about to begin fighting “knowing full well (me at least) that we are embarking on an operation from which not all of us will return. Despite that, I look back and sideways and I’m very confident in ourselves. We are sharp, we have prepared well… when my thoughts wander a little — why us and why now — that’s what I think about, and suddenly the answer is very clear to me. Fighting for this country, leading this unit, is not supreme heroism – it is the standard.”\nThe final line of the letter, his family engraved on his headstone: “If I had to sculpt anew my life, I wouldn’t change a thing.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 265 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Idan Dor, 25, from Givat Ze’ev, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while trying to flee the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nIdan attended the rave with his childhood friend, Ram Shalom. When the Hamas attack began, Idan spoke to his sister, and told her that he was trying to escape, and was hiding with Ram from the terrorists, before the connection was cut.\n“For eight days, we did not know what had happened to him, but I, with every fiber of my being, believed he was still alive,” his sister, Daniela told Ynet. The family heard from several reports that Idan was killed when he jumped on a terrorist who entered a roadside bomb shelter where he had sought safety. Both Idan and Ram were slain in the onslaught.\nIdan was buried on October 15 in Jerusalem. Months later, his family was informed that additional remains of his had been identified, and they were added to his grave.\nIdan is survived by his parents, Ophir and Michal, as well as his three siblings, Jordan, Daniela and Amit.\nIdan studied at Denmark High School in Jerusalem, and played soccer for Hapoel Katamon, in the position of center midfielder, from 2013 to 2016. His coach described Idan as a “good and pure boy, humble but a fighter; he was incredibly competitive.” During his mandatory IDF service, he served in the Nahal Brigade as a combat soldier and was discharged early due to a leg injury. After a long period of traveling around the world, he returned to Israel and began working at the airport.\nHis father, Ophir, a contractor and artist, turned his grief into artwork, including painting with his own blood after he cut open his hand when hearing of his son’s death: “Before the tragedy, it was my hobby, after the tragedy, it became my escape,” he told a local news site. “Idan loved my work, he would observe things in his own silence.”\nIdan, he said, “touched everyone. He would take care of his older brother, who had special needs; he was extremely sensitive to those around him. He was a modest boy, a leader from birth, but without every raising his voice, just by using his eyes.”\nHis sister, Daniela, told a local news site that “in his short life, Idan did not commit to long-term plans. It’s like he knew that his time on earth would be short; he lived a vibrant life. He loved to have fun and dance with his friends. He lived his life to the fullest.”\nHer brother, she said, “was a sensitive boy, he knew how to weather tough situations… he had a unique life wisdom that he was born with, he loved people and pursued peace.”\nIdan “was a wonderful son to his parents, completely fulfilled the commandment of ‘honor your parents.’ He was an incredible brother to his older brother, Yarden, who had special needs, and it was one of Idan’s life missions to take care of Yarden.”\nHer brother, Daniela added, “was a modest and kind person, who loved freely, respected every person… He was an honest and decent person, and the commandment to ‘love your neighbor as yourself’ described him better than anything.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Cpl. Ofir Davidian, 18, a logistics soldier in the Home Front Command, from Patish, was killed on October 7 when Hamas terrorists overran the Urim IDF base.\nOfir had only enlisted in the IDF in July 2023, and was assigned to the Urim base just three weeks before the Hamas attack, after completing basic training. That morning marked the first weekend Ofir had ever spent on the base.\nWhen the sirens first sounded, Ofir and others ran for the shelter on base, and since she grew up in the Gaza envelope area, she was used to the sirens and calmed her friends down, according to a eulogy on the Forum Dvorah site, which seeks to highlight women’s contributions to national security.\nOfir and her fellow soldiers then returned to their living quarters, but when they realized there was a terrorist invasion, Ofir, Cpl. Lior Levy and Sgt. Itamar Ayash decided to run toward the war room, which they believed to be the safest place on base. All three were shot dead on the way by Hamas gunmen. Ultimately, four other soldiers were killed trying to defend the war room from the invasion.\nOfir was buried in Ofakim on October 9. She is survived by her parents, Lilach and Asaf, and her four younger sisters Hadar, 17, Omer, 15, Or, 12 and Lir, 6.\nAccording to an online eulogy written by her parents, Ofir was a doting older sister, who excelled in her studies, loved music and going out dancing and was into makeup and beauty products, always wanting to look her best. As part of efforts to memorialize her, they released a line of makeup in her name.\nHer sister, Hadar, wrote online, “My anchor, my sister… how could you leave us like this and just go?”\n“My Ofir, you would light up every place you went, you were the light of the house, the light of the family,” she wrote. When times were hard, “you knew how to raise everyone’s spirits and to say that everything was for the best and to throw in a joke and make everyone laugh.”\n“Ofir, my big sister, I love you and I loved you so much, you are my pride and my inspiration, the best sister I could ever ask for… I miss your unique laugh, I miss fighting with you, I miss you Ofir, and I can’t believe I’ll never see you again.”\nHer mother, Lilach, told the Mako news site that “Ofir was very social, loved by everyone, a girl with morals who respected those around her, loved her friends and family — being family-oriented was very important to her.”\n“She was energetic, full of life, loud — you could hear her for miles if she was shouting, singing or laughing or speaking loudly,” Lilach added.\nOn Friday night, hours before she was killed, her family brought her homemade food to the base, “she was so happy that we brought her food, we poked fun at her that she was spoiled,” said Lilach. “She always told me she wanted to be exactly like me when she grew up, giving and happy, she said she admired me and that I was a source of pride.”\nTheir last vacation together as a family, said Lilach, was in June in Eilat, “right before Ofir enlisted, Ofir had a fun time with her sisters before the army, she was so excited to enlist and to leave the house… this was our last trip together as a whole family.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

When the rocket fire began, Amit and his friends tried to flee in their car, but he was shot and killed.\nBefore he was killed, he had initially informed his mother that they were returning home from the party, but later phoned her as he drew his last breaths, whispering: “Mom, I love you.”\nHe was confirmed dead three days later, on October 10, and was buried that day in Beit Shemesh. He is survived by his parents, Yigal and Limor, and his two younger siblings, Iddo, 21, and Ofri, 14.\nHaving attended the prestigious Boyar school in Jerusalem, Amit enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces, serving as a fighter in the 603rd Battalion. After his release, he traveled to South America with friends for several months, and upon his return began studying to be a real estate entrepreneur, which was his dream.\nHe then opened a real estate agency in Beersheba, but was able to realize his dream for about a month before he was murdered.\n“Amit made everyone who knew him better,” his mother, Limor, told a local news site. “We want him to be remembered for his joy, compassion, and his dying wish: ‘Smile, be kind, and love one another.’”\nHis father Yigal wrote on Ynet: “My heart aches more with each passing day. I don’t know how to go on like this, no one prepared me. I miss you to death and imagine that you’re coming back home. I kiss you and don’t let go. Come home, I’m waiting.”\nIn her eulogy, His aunt Sigi promised to support his parents and brothers and try to move on, but asked him to “send us the strength to deal with the eternal pain.”\nHis cousin, Dor Parnassa, shared a love of soccer with Amit. They were both diehard fans of the Beitar Jerusalem soccer team: “Our entire childhood revolved around soccer,” he wrote on the club’s official website. “We used to love talking about soccer together so much, watching the games, playing together, and being disappointed in Beitar on Friday night dinners. I promise you I’ll keep taking you to games with me. I know you’d love that.”\n“My life was turned upside down the day he was murdered,” his niece, Ofir David told a local news site. “I’ll forever keep his memory alive. He was an angel on earth, and now he is an angel in the sky.”\n“Not everyone has the privilege of knowing such a powerful personality,” his friend Ofir Vaknin similarly told the site. “I used to always look at him and learn how to smile for no reason. Just smile, and the world will smile back at you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 268 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

He and his comrades were among the first to battle the terrorists who had stormed across the Gaza border just a couple kilometers away.\nThey jumped into action and suited up with the start of the fighting, but were vastly outnumbered. Early on in the battle, Ofir was hit by two bullets that breached a gap in his ceramic vest, and he was killed on the spot.\nHe was buried on October 9 in Yokneam. He is survived by his parents, Noga and Ron, and his siblings Nir and Shir.\nFour other members of Ofir’s platoon were also slain that morning — Cpt. Itay Maor, Sgt. Uri Locker, Sgt. Amit Tsur, and Sgt. Dvir Lisha. Just days before they were all slain, the five soldiers, who were close friends, took a photo together that served as a chilling memorial after their deaths.\nBorn and raised in Yokneam, Ofir was an active member and later counselor in his local scout troop. He loved to play soccer with his friends and was a dedicated fan of the Maccabi Haifa team as well as FC Barcelona, according to a memorial site.\nAfter finishing high school, Ofir did a year of national service at a dormitory in Kfar Saba for kids with challenging backgrounds, and dreamed of pursuing a career in education.

    "story": "Sgt. Boaz Menashe Yoggev, 19, a technician in the Gaza Division, from Talmon, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the Nahal Oz IDF outpost.\nBoaz, who had enlisted in the IDF in August 2022, was placed in the Kometz Unit, which is responsible for maintaining and repairing the Gaza border fence. The morning of the attack, Boaz ran to a bomb shelter on base when the sirens first sounded without any weapons or protective gear, according to a memorial site.\nWhen wounded soldiers joined him in the shelter, Boaz understood that terrorists had infiltrated, and decided to run back to his room and grabbed his weapon and an extra magazine and then ran back to the shelter and positioned himself at one of the entrances. There he stood, battling against Hamas for several hours as they threw grenades and fired volleys of bullets until he was shot in the head and killed.\nHe was slain alongside Golani soldiers Staff Sgt. Nehoray Amitay, Staff Sgt. Barak Ben David and Staff Sgt. Sahar Meidani, according to his family.\nOnly one other soldier in the Kometz Unit, Liron Kullock, was on base that weekend. Liron told the Kan public broadcaster that amid all the chaos, Boaz called her to find out where she was, urging her to seek shelter and staying with her on the phone until she did. Liron was wounded but ultimately rescued alive from the base.\n“[Boaz] realized there were terrorists and ran to his room, took his weapon and stood at one of the entrances to the shelter, without a helmet or bulletproof vest,” Liron told Kan. “Boaz fought because that’s who he was, he wouldn’t have fled. Even though we didn’t have combat training and we’d never prepared for anything like this, he knew that this is what he had to do.”\nLiron said despite them coming from vastly different backgrounds, “we were still very close friends. And the fact that I am here alive with my family is because of him. He was a wonderful friend because it didn’t matter that we were different, we were just good friends. Maybe it’s a little naive to think [such a connection] could happen in civilian life outside of the army, but if only we could all look at the person in front of us, who is so different from us, and think ‘maybe we can be friends.'”\nBoaz was buried on October 12 in the West Bank settlement of Dolev. He is survived by his parents, Atara and Gil, and his nine siblings, Shahar, Erel, Tzofnat, Yehuda, Noa, Maayan, Rachel, Talia and Benzion.\nBorn in Elazar in the West Bank, the third out of 10 siblings and the oldest boy, Boaz’s family moved when he was 4 years old to Susya in the South Hebron Hills, and later to the settlement of Neria in the Talmon bloc. During his years in yeshiva high school he explored a love of agriculture, mechanics and carpentry, working with his hands and building chairs and planters at home.\nIn a eulogy, his father Gil described him as a “beloved boy. Simply a kid who was loved. Truly, everyone loved him.”\nBoaz “had hands of gold. Everything you touched was with excellence. You knew how to make rockers and chairs out of wood. To organize things at home with no problem. To take care of the car. You always got up when anyone needed help.”\nHis son, he said, “had a unique light inside. Just a smiling and loved kid. Oy, Boaz. We as a family simply loved you. I have nothing else to say. True love from all the heart. We admired you. From the start you were a holy and pure soul, who got to come down to earth, apparently for just a short time.

    "story": "Shahak “Shasho” Yosef Madar, 26, from Dimona, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHe attended the rave that weekend with a group of friends from Dimona, including Liam Bor Galon, who was also slain that day, and Segev Kalfon, who was taken hostage and is still believed to be held captive in Gaza.\nFor more than a week, his family searched desperately for any sign of him, before they were informed that his body had been identified.\nShahak was buried in Dimona on October 15. He is survived by his parents, Merav and Doron, and his siblings Ofri, Carmel, Tomer, Or and Zohar.\nBorn and raised in Dimona as the oldest of six siblings, Shahak was an active youth leader, according to a state eulogy. During his mandatory army service he served in the Nahal Brigade’s 932nd Battalion.\nAfter his release, he got a job at the Dead Sea Works company to save up money, before embarking on a nearly yearlong trip around the world, traveling through India and South and Central America. After returning to Israel, he went back to work at Dead Sea Works to save up for his studies, which he began in 2022.\nShahak was pursuing a degree in hospitality and tourism at Ben Gurion University in Beersheba, and was slated to begin his second year just a couple weeks after he was slain.\nHis close friend, Ofek Caspi, wrote on Facebook about “the man and the huge smile, which captivates the world in a second. Your presence is so very missed, my brother.”\n“Everyone knows that there’s no such thing as Ofek without Shahak and Shahak without Ofek, some people saw as as one person — and it will stay that way, my brother, you will always be part of me,” he wrote. “As you would say, we’re like ying and yang, we balance and complete each other and together we were the perfect duo.”\n“You were a little more crazy and optimistic, and I’m a little more rational,” he said. “I’m sorry I wasn’t there to bring down your innocent optimism as always, although it certainly wouldn’t have helped and you would have offered your famous ‘it’s all good.’… We were so looking forward to this year, we planned so many things, where did you go, my brother? We didn’t finish our list of dreams. I’m happy I had the privilege of growing up beside you, crossing continents with you and conquering the world, experiencing the best moments in life.”\nHis sister, Ofri, wrote on Facebook, “My Shasho — I’m proud of you.”\n“I’m proud of the accomplishments you achieved, the dreams you reached, the goals you stormed, but mostly — the person you were,” she wrote. “I promise to smile for the good and not just for your sake, to live as if you’re holding my hand in my imagination, and to be strengthened in the belief that you are always watching over me.”\nOfri pointed out that in the Dimona cemetery where Shahak is buried, “there is one unique gravestone, pointed toward the sky, that at a certain point of the day its edge blends with the sun because the person buried there is a huge light.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 271 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Sgt. Maj. Yorai Eliyahu Cohen, 29, a police officer in the Yamam counter-terrorism unit, from Nahariya, was killed on October 7 battling Hamas at the Sha’ar Hanegev Junction.\nHe was called up to the front lines the morning of the Hamas attack, and was heading toward Sderot with other members of his team, according to his family. On the way there, they were directed to the Sha’ar Hanegev Junction, just outside the city, where they engaged in heavy gunfire with cells of Hamas terrorists. Yorai and fellow Yamam officer Supt. Avraham Hankin were shot dead in the firefight.\nYorai was buried on October 9 in Nahariya. He is survived by his wife, Adar, their daughter, Niv, 1, his parents, Yaacov and Esti, and his siblings Bar and Noa.\nBorn in Hatzor Haglilit in the Galilee, Yorai was raised in Nahariya and in nearby Kibbutz Sa’ar. He played soccer for many years in his youth, a hobby he kept up with as an adult, and was a devoted fan of the Maccabi Haifa team. As an adult he trained intensely with Crossfit, and loved to relax by grilling up quality meats and sipping on a beer.\nDuring his mandatory IDF service, he served in the Paratroopers Brigade and fought in the 2014 Gaza war, Operation Protective Edge. After finishing his army service he worked for three years in the Shin Bet, during which he lived in Kibbutz Gevim near the Gaza border, before joining the Israel Police in January 2020 and serving in the Yamam counter-terrorism unit as a squad commander.\nIn 2021, he married Adar, his high school sweetheart, and in 2022 their daughter Niv was born.\nHis brother Bar, wrote to Yorai on what would have been his 30th birthday: “I can’t comprehend the fact that you’re not here, not with us to celebrate the way you loved, with all your wonderful friends, with us, and the little family you built.”\n“Yorai, we miss your laugh, your silliness your jokes,” Bar added. “I miss the good meat you knew how to make, that I have no idea how to do. You were such an incredible father, you raised your daughter wonderfully, she misses you and thinks about you all the time… We’re all always in awe of her intelligence and her perfect smile, and I’m sure you’re so proud… It’s your birthday today, we decorated, and we tried to think of everything. We hope you love it.”\nIn a memorial video, his mother, Esti, said she was still waiting “for him to open the door, with his height and his strength and walk inside. But it seems like it won’t happen.”\n“Yorai was a mischievous boy, a boy who loved people and kids,” she said. “He had a dream of being a [professional] soccer player, but at the start of 12th grade he realized he wanted to do a meaningful army service, and he achieved that goal… At this stage in his life, Yorai realized that serving in the security forces was very important” and that he wanted to continue.\n“It’s such a pity that Niv won’t get to experience him as a father,” added Esti. Fatherhood, she said, “brought out in him a softness and worry and love that I never saw in my life.”\nHis widow, Adar, wrote on Facebook in November 2023 on the 13th anniversary of their relationship.\n“It wasn’t love at first sight and we went through so much together. A journey that I wouldn’t change for a second, a journey that turned us into the couple we were,” she wrote. “After the wedding, I was bummed that I had to reset the count [of us being together] and start celebrating a new date — even though we never made a big deal about either of them, and we’ll never get to celebrate our third anniversary.”\n“For 13 years I felt safe, beautiful, smart, funny, like I had an anchor and a big, muscular support system for every decision I made,” she added. “And I had the one person who knew me best in the world who loved me endlessly. Our count is starting anew, this time from October 7, 2023.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Inbar Shem Tov, 22, from Holon, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nInbar was among a group of partygoers who hid inside a dumpster soon after Hamas terrorists raided the fest, from which she initially sent her father, Aharon, a video message saying: “Everything is OK,” giving him a thumbs up.\nAharon rushed for his gun and drove as fast as possible to the scene, but received another message from her before he managed to arrive: “By the time someone comes to rescue us, we will die.”\nInbar attended the rave with two of her friends, Amit Levy and Shir Georgy, and all three were slain by Hamas that day at the festival. Amit’s twin, Shany, also attended the party but was able to survive by hiding under their bodies, according to a eulogy by the Holon municipality.\nInbar was buried on October 10 in Holon. She is survived by her parents, Hani and Aharon, and her younger siblings Noa, Netanel and Ariel.\nHaving excelled at her military service as a Border Police fighter, Inbar moved to Eilat after her release, where she worked in a hotel and studied to be a graphic artist, saving up money with the hope of traveling the world and working as a “digital nomad.”\nShe practiced yoga and breathing exercises and was a big believer in perpetual spiritual growth, according to a state eulogy.\nA local memorial site noted that in her diary Inbar wrote, “The time has come for a change. Let’s connect to ourselves and allow our endless energies to be our best selves. Love thy neighbor as thyself, for we are all one. We’re all interconnected, we’re all the universe. Creation lies within us all, as each one of us experiences reality subjectively through our consciousness.”\nHer high school teacher, Rivka, shared after her death the thank you note she had written to Inbar for graduation: “’Thank you for allowing me to be there for you. Thank you for consulting and sharing with me, and for your integrity and honesty. Our conversations always touched me with your wisdom and sensitivity.’ I had the privilege of being your teacher and being by your side during your best years in high school. Rest in peace.”\nInbar’s brother described her as “the happiest person I ever knew. She was the most loving, inclusive, accepting, and attentive person. She’s always been my so-called confidant, who taught me the meaning of selfless love and acceptance of others. I try to implement that.”\nHer mother, Hani, wrote on Facebook that Inbar “turned me into a mother for the first time 22 years ago, to a blossoming, perfect, strong woman, the happiest in the world. I was blessed to raise you for 22 years, and then life took you from me on October 7. I withered, I fell apart, I was left breathless, they took away my oxygen.”\n“My love, I wish I could just for a moment escape on the wing of a bird, fly up above and see my light, to hug you, to kiss you, to hear your voice.

    "story": "Roee Munder, 50, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7.\nThe morning of the attack, he posted to his Facebook page several times about the rocket fire, with his last post coming at 7:21 a.m. His family said his home was completely destroyed in a fire set during the onslaught.\nThe same day, his parents, Ruti and Avraham Munder, were taken hostage to Gaza, as was his sister, Keren, and her son, Ohad. Ruti, Keren and Ohad were freed from captivity on November 24 as part of a weeklong truce deal. His mother and sister learned while listening to the radio in captivity that Roee had been killed.\nIn August 2024, Avraham‘s body was recovered by IDF troops and returned to Israel, where his family was informed that he had been killed while in captivity.\nRoee was initially buried in Kibbutz Metzer on October 21, 2023, without any of his immediate family present to mourn. On August 21, 2024, Roee was reburied in Kibbutz Nir Oz alongside his father, Avraham, in a joint ceremony.\nRoee is survived by his mother, Ruti and sister Keren.\nA eulogy from Kibbutz Nir Oz noted that he worked on the kibbutz as an electrician, and also pursued photography as a hobby.\n“Your caring and your sensitivity stood out greatly… When you loved something, you were devoted to it with all your heart,” the kibbutz said. “You were a sworn soccer fan, especially Liverpool, which you traveled to support anywhere you could go.”\nAt his funeral, his friend and fellow Liverpool devotee Rotem Zmora described Roee as a “photographer, storyteller, footballer and crazy, annoying uncle that always has weird jokes but loves you unconditionally.”\n“He wore his heart on his sleeve and spoke completely unfiltered. You didn’t always understand what he wanted to say or in what context it was said, but that was part of his special charm,” he said. As fellow fans, “We cried at defeats, and we cried at triumphs. On one hand, tears of sadness. On the other, tears of joy. I had the pleasure of celebrating and crying with you, screaming and dancing, going crazy and going wild.”\n“Thank you for the privilege of calling you a friend,” Rotem added. “I want to hear more of your calls to radio stations asking why they played this specific song when there’s a better version. I want more of those endless arguments. I want the next meetup, the next burger, the next beer. I want more. And it’s gone.”\nAfter returning from Hamas captivity, Keren Munder, Roee’s older sister, penned a tribute to her little brother, describing him as a loving and inquisitive person, who suffered with ADHD, hyperactivity and neurofibromatosis, but learned to deal with life’s challenges, and explored a wide range of interests.\n“You were a modest person,” she wrote. “You invested in the things you loved — to watch soccer games and live concerts, to buy photography equipment, bikes and gardening tools. You loved to travel to visit friends and family, and you took such good care of your home that was destroyed and burned by monsters.”\nRoee sometimes felt walled in by the small kibbutz, “and you developed strong opinions of your own and stood your ground even when it seemed that you just loved to argue, you just wanted people to listen to your worldview, to see you as you are and not just hear you,” Keren added.\n“You had a huge sense of justice and were sensitive, with a big heart, ready to help and do things for others with love and dedication,” she continued. He was a devoted son to his parents, a loving brother and uncle, and “we will remember you always with love as a warm and loving family member who maintained ties with everyone. We will say goodbye to you with agonized longing and with a line from the song of your beloved Liverpool: ‘You will never walk alone.'”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 274 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

When the rocket fire began, Joni, Yael and another friend left in their car to head home but got stuck in the gridlock. Joni decided to turn around and head elsewhere, but the car came under heavy fire from terrorists along the side of the highway.\nJoni was wounded and stopped the car, and their friend managed to flee, but Yael stayed to try and treat Joni and get help. As they lay there, terrorists killed them both in a hail of bullets.\nJoni was buried in Hod Hasharon on October 15. He is survived by his parents, Amir and Ela, and his two older sisters, Danielle and Tom.\nHe was born in Bonn, Germany, due to his family’s diplomatic posting, and returned to Israel when he was 2, settling in Hod Hasharon, according to a state eulogy. After finishing school, he enlisted in the IDF and served in the Paratrooper’s Brigade, including fighting in the 2014 Gaza War.\nAfter his release, he worked jobs at a number of restaurants to save up for a big trip abroad, which he spent in the Far East, culminating in a period where he lived in New Zealand and worked as a locksmith. Upon his return to Israel, Joni decided to study business administration at the Ruppin Academic Center, which is where he met Yael.\nAfter finishing their studies, the couple decided to move together to Tel Aviv, and in 2022 Joni opened a restaurant in the city, called Arais Machne Yehuda — a branch of the original Jerusalem eatery serving the traditional arais, pita stuffed with ground meat. Joni loved the nightlife, going out drinking and partying with friends, attending festivals with Yael, enjoying good food and serving good food to others with a smile.\nIn his memory, his mother is producing a cookbook of all his favorite dishes. His sister, Tom, named her newborn after Yehonatan, and many of his friends and family got a tattoo of one of his favorite song lyrics: “Where the heart is pure, that’s where the party is.”\nJoni’s older sisters, Tom and Danielle, wrote in a post on an Instagram memorial page to “our little brother, larger than life.”\n“All your life we, your big sisters, were like little moms,” they wrote. “You were our baby Jo, a serious brat who we could never get mad at. And even though we were the older ones, you taught us a lot about life.”\nNow, they wrote, “How are we supposed to go on living without you? Without your laughter and your joy. Without the energy you brought to the house. Without your stories and your jokes, without your wit and sharpness. How can we no longer have a little brother? You broke our hearts. And there is nothing in the world that can fill the loss that is you.”\nJoni’s mother, Ela, said on a Kan memorial podcast that Joni and Yael “were not parted in life nor in death.”\n“Our Yehonatan was a boy who was always surrounded by joy and light. A boy of free love, a kid who magnetized all those around him,” she said. “He took the world by storm, he laughed big, he loved big, and left us unwritten but clear last wishes, that we have to continue in his path.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Sgt. Lavi Shmuel Megged Buchnik, 20, a soldier in the Paratroopers Brigade from Peduim, was killed on October 7 while battling the Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Kissufim.\nAt 7:20 a.m., his mother said, Lavi called and told her to stay in the house and to lock all the doors and windows, and that was the last time they spoke.\nLavi and his comrades were directed to Sderot to battle the invasion there, but while they were on their way were told instead to head to Kissufim. Along the way they engaged in battles with terrorists on the side of the highway, killing many of them. Inside the kibbutz, they engaged in a fierce firefight, and even after being wounded, Lavi kept fighting until he was killed in battle.\nLavi, a Negevist, was in the middle of a squad commander’s course when he was slain in Kissufim alongside five others in the course: Staff Sgt. Omri Peretz, Staff Sgt. Regev Amar, Sgt. Matan Malka and Sgt. Bar Yankilov and Staff Sgt. Adam Agmon.\nHe was buried in Peduim on October 10. He is survived by his parents, Miri and Shalom, and his seven siblings, Yosef, Rachel, Yehudit, Tal, Renee, Odeya and Roi.\nThe seventh out of the eight children in the family, Lavi was born in Jerusalem and raised in the small southern moshav of Peduim, according to an online eulogy.\nDuring high school, he volunteered with the Fire and Rescue Services and was also active in his local youth group. After high school, he completed a year of national service with an agricultural group in Moshav Talmei Elazar in the north.\nIn December 2022, he enlisted in the IDF for his mandatory service, and though he had dreamed of serving in the Shayetet 13 elite Navy unit, he was ultimately placed in the Paratroopers Brigade. His family said that Lavi had been planning his army service for years and was dedicated to playing a meaningful role in the military.\nHe was undergoing a squad commander’s course at the time he was killed, and was also planning to later pursue an officer’s course, his loved ones said.\n“Lavi was a smiling and sarcastic boy, he stood out for his love of the country and his dedication to the people important to him and was prepared to go above and beyond for them,” according to an online eulogy written by his family. “Lavi loved the country, and from a young age, he was looking forward to enlisting and having a meaningful service in the IDF as a combat soldier. Lavi was a prankster of a kid, funny, with a smile that lit up every room he entered. He was the best friend in the world — loyal, caring, volunteering and helping, put everyone ahead of himself.”\nHis close friend, Neta Kachlon, wrote on Instagram that when he heard about Lavi’s bravery on the last day of his life, “I wasn’t surprised at all, because it was the most you thing to do.”\n“What do I have left to say? How much you were my best friend? That’s already a cliche,” he added. “To say what a hero you were, everyone already knows, to say you were such a good person, special and wonderful, everybody already knows. There aren’t enough words in the world to describe how much, my God, how much people like you are missed in the world.

    "story": "Dan Damri, 21, from the Gaza border settlement Tzohar, was murdered by Hamas terrorists mere minutes before he reached home after fleeing the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHe attended the rave with a group of friends — including his girlfriend Shir Yaron, Chen Ben Avi, Dudi Turgeman and Dor Nahum — who fled the party together in one car when the rocket fire began. The five of them made it to the Mivtahim Junction, just outside their homes, where they were all shot dead by Hamas terrorists lying in wait. A day later, their bodies were all discovered lying in the road, riddled with bullets.\nDan was buried in the cemetery in Tzohar and is survived by his mother, Shoshana, and his five older siblings, Shimrit, Nir, Shlomi, Tal and Chen. His father, Eliyahu, died when Dan was 13.\nHe had finished his mandatory military service only a month before he was murdered.\nHis brother, Nir, said Dan was the “funniest and happiest” person in the world.\nDan’s sister wrote on an Instagram page in his memory that his “passion was people,” and “there was no one who didn’t want to be his best friend because he would light up any room he entered.”\n“Before anything, he was a good person, and despite his challenges and difficulties in the army and at school, he didn’t give up and always rose again after every fall,” she wrote.\nShe added that he always used to bring animals home to his mother including a goat named Nancy who escaped one day while he was in the army, forcing his mother to chase after her.\nDan’s teenage niece, Eden, wrote that although he was her uncle, he had been more like a brother and was her “heart” and her “whole life.”\n“You were supposed to take me to my first party, the person I was supposed to drink with for the first time, the one who was supposed to tease me and laugh at me,” she wrote, adding that it did not make sense to her that he was no longer around.\nDan’s friends from the army set up a crowdfunding page to raise money for his family, and described him as “the heart of the platoon whom everyone loved and wanted to be around.”\n“When things were hard, he raised everyone’s spirits with his jokes and positive outlook,” they wrote. “Everyone who knew Dan knew that he would never leave you alone when you needed him.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 277 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Maj. Ilay Zisser, 27, a soldier in the elite Sayeret Matkal unit, from Givat Ela, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Kfar Aza.\nAt 7:30 that morning, he was called in to head to the front lines to counter the Hamas onslaught. Ilay was part of a small team of nine Sayeret Matkal soldiers — including his close friend and confidant, Cpt. Hadar Kama — who were among the first Israeli forces to head into the besieged Kibbutz Kfar Aza.\nVastly outnumbered, the elite soldiers charged ahead, and Ilay, Hadar, Maj. Tal Cohen and Cpt. Amir Zur were killed in the firefight. Ilay and Hadar, who had served together for years and had formed a strong bond, shared a birthday — July 11 — and also a date of death: October 7, 2023.\nIlay was buried on October 12 in the Nahalal Cemetery in the Jezreel Valley. He is survived by his wife, Tomer, his parents, Vered and Daniel, and his three older siblings Ido, Lior and Noam.\nIlay grew up in Givat Ela, and lived in Beersheba with his wife, Tomer, who he met in the army in 2018 and wed in 2022.\nA career officer, Ilay had been in the military for close to a decade when he was killed, first enlisting in 2014 as a cadet in the Israeli Air Force’s flight course, and later serving as a soldier and commander in Sayeret Matkal, where he eventually headed his own team. Ilay’s family said he planned to eventually finish his military service and study engineering, with a focus on environmental and ecological projects.\nHe loved to play chess, his loved ones said, and was also very outdoorsy, enjoying hiking and running and exploring the country. In his memory, his family has set up a “Running with Zisser” initiative, staging memorial runs around the country, “preserving his spirit and legacy while doing the things he loved and promoting a cause he believed in.”\nHis wife, Tomer, told the Kan public broadcaster that together they had bought a plot of land in Kibbutz Shoval outside Beersheba, where they planned to build a house and raise a family.\n“We had normal dreams — a family, four kids, a dog. He was my home and he was my roots.” His death, she said, is like “someone detached me from my roots, separated me from my foundation.”\nSpeaking to a Kan memorial podcast, Tomer said that “Ilay loved to play the guitar, to read poetry, to play chess. He loved to travel around Israel, he really loved the desert.”\nOn October 5, 2023, the couple traveled with the members of Ilay’s Sayeret Matkal team to the Tamar Festival, a flagship music and cultural event that takes place each year near the Dead Sea on Sukkot.\n“It was so much fun, we were all together, we danced, we enjoyed, we heard the songs — and Ilay was so excited, it was his first time at a festival like this,” said Tomer. “In hindsight, it was almost like a goodbye party for the team.”\n“My treasure, your energy will always accompany me, and I will miss you forever,” she said.\nIlay’s mother, Vered Zisser, told the Kan public broadcaster that despite her son’s high-risk job, “I didn’t worry. I had so much faith in him, in his abilities, in the fact that he was experienced and measured and smart and knew how to plan.”\nVered said she looked up in a dictionary “the definition of a hero. It’s someone who goes out to save somebody without thinking about themselves. That was Ilay. He’s a hero, but I’d be happier if he was alive. I’d be happy if he had waited just one more moment.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Eight days after the festival, her body was identified by DNA, she said, and the family was told that she was killed along with many others who had been hiding out in an ambulance that was hit by an RPG, with most of the bodies inside badly burned and difficult to identify.\nShe was buried on October 17 in Jerusalem.

After returning to Israel, she studied hairdressing and worked in a salon, a job that loved ones said served mostly to fund her travels and festival attendance.\nMoriya, who was once known for her bright green curls and her many tattoos, also explored creative endeavors, including drawing, baking and massage therapy, said her family.\n“Moriya Or got to live life with exuberance, to take it by storm, to love, to fall in love, to travel, to dance, to gather a huge circle of friends, to be a wonderful daughter, granddaughter, niece and cousin and to leave her stamp forever,” wrote her father. “But she didn’t manage to start her own business, as she planned, or to travel in Australia, or return to India, or to get married and build a family.”\nHer mother, Sandra, eulogized Moriya as a “a girl of great light.”\n“Her big smile and her kind and sparkling eyes will remain engraved in every person she met along the way,” wrote her mother. “She was a girl who loved humanity, loved people no matter their age, gender or color, she loved animals on land and water. She loved nature and she had a blind faith in God. A girl of strong values of love, joy, huge generosity and gratitude for what she had.”\nMoriya was creative and blessed “with golden hands,” added Sandra, noting that her daughter made jewelry, painted, cooked and baked. “She worked as a talented hairdresser at a very prestigious salon in Tel Aviv and kept up also with trips and festivals abroad,” she added. “She went to the Nova festival and met there all her friends she had made over the years.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Shoham Shlomo Nidam, 19, a technician in the Golani Brigade, from Kiryat Shmona, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the Nahal Oz IDF outpost.\nShoham had begun his mandatory army service in February 2023, less than seven months before he was slain. He was stationed at the Nahal Oz post, and was on guard duty overnight when the Hamas invasion began, his father said.\nAt 7 a.m. he texted his dad, “If something happens to me, I love you guys,” before adding, “They’re nearby. You won’t believe what’s happening here.” That was the last message he sent.\nShoham sought safety in a bomb shelter alongside five balloon operators as they waged a battle against the Hamas intruders — but they were vastly outnumbered and all were slain in the gunfight early that morning. Five days after he was killed, Shoham’s family was officially informed of his death.\nHe was buried on October 13 in Kiryat Shmona. He is survived by his parents, Carmit and Avi, and his younger sister Rotem.\nHis aunt, Kochi Bonan, wrote on Facebook to “our Shoham.”\n“I can’t describe the pain that is sitting in our hearts, how can this be your fate?” she wrote. “A pure and good boy who lit up the world… We miss your presence, your rolling laughter, your innocence and your purity. You are missed in every moment, you will forever remain Shoham, our perfect angel.”\nA former teacher, Livnat Artzi, described on Facebook her memories of “the rolling laughter of an adolescent boy.”\n“A boy whom I taught for two years, a boy — a teen — who came shyly into the classroom and never cursed or insulted anyone, but spread love and smiles everywhere,” she wrote.\nShoham’s mother, Carmit, wrote on Instagram, “My Shoham, my perfect boy.”\n“I was privileged to be your mom for 20 years of joy, pleasure, and endless love,” she added. “I miss you, I miss our conversations, the laughter, the songs, I miss my son. You are so missed, there is a hole in my heart since you left.”\nEvery moment of the day “I think about you, how special you were, how much you loved us, respected us, how much you cared for us and how modest you were,” Carmit continued. “You were a dream child. Everyone who met you loved you… You were the perfect brother to Rotem, you loved each other so much, you were the best of friends.”\n“When you left, you took my heart with you, and my soul.

    "story": "Ariel Mordechai Biton, 22, from Holon, was murdered by Hamas terrorists on October 7 while trying to flee the Supernova music festival.\nHe attended the rave with his girlfriend, Eden Ben Rubi. When the rocket fire began, the pair fled the site of the festival and sought safety in a roadside bomb shelter. There, both Ariel and Eden were slain by terrorists who fired inside and threw grenades into the structure.\nHe was buried on October 10 in Holon. He is survived by his parents, Hadar and Yoram, his younger sister Kai and his grandmother Aliza.\nAriel and Kai were raised from a young age by their grandmother Aliza, according to a state eulogy. He attended schools in Holon and was an active basketball player, and also loved surfing. He even traveled around the world pursuing the best waves, with surfing trips to both El Salvador and the Maldives, and also instructed a kids’ surfing class.\nDuring his mandatory army service, Ariel served as a squad commander in the Nahal’s Brigade’s 931st Infantry Battalion. According to a Holon municipal eulogy, he took a big trip around Sri Lanka and India after being released, where he met Eden, and when he returned to Israel — just a few months before he was killed — he took some courses in investment and had planned to pursue university studies in psychology.\nHis close friend, Daniel Rogozinski, wrote on an Instagram memorial page to “my dear brother Ariel.”\nThe pair met, he said, a year earlier vacationing in the Sinai Desert, “and it was enough to turn us into brothers. The very first time I saw you I knew what a crazy kid you were, and I was pulled in within a moment.”\nTogether, he said, “we spent entire nights planning our parties. My soul burns with longing for the laughter, the hanging out, the happiness, the crises, the moods, the shared dreams that will never come true… you were an anchor of joy and craziness to me amid all the normality and the boringness. You knew how to live life in the happiest way possible, and despite all the shit you went through, you schooled everyone on being happy.”\nAriel’s grandmother Aliza, who raised him since he was 6 years old, told Ynet that “he was a boy who was always surrounded by friends. He was the glue, he loved everyone and everyone loved him. He was a wonderful kid, everyone always praised him. He had a lot of optimism, he only saw the good, not the bad. He always helped everyone, advised his friends, and me as well. He wanted to study psychology but he never got to it.”\nAriel’s younger sister, Kai wrote on Instagram to “my Ariel, my ray of light, my support system — I have no words and at the same time I want to say all the words in the world.”\n“You are my hope in life and you always will be. Siblings like us aren’t found anywhere else, as kids we never fought, you always took care me and never got mad, never yelled, you always supported me and smiled at me. Your smile gives me strength,” Kai added. “You are my blood, and there’s no way to describe in words how much I love you.”\n“You taught me to be happy, to live, you made sure I was never lacking anything, at any moment,” she continued. “I’m trying to be like you, to dress like you, to be happy like you, to listen to the songs you listen to, to work at your job, everything is you.

    "story": "Yossi Vahab, 65, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was murdered in his home on the kibbutz on October 7 by Hamas terrorists.\nHis family said he was hiding out in his home’s reinforced room, holding on to the handle to prevent the terrorists from breaking in, with his gun in the other hand. But Yossi was outnumbered by the Hamas gunmen, and killed on the spot. His wife, the family said, was saved by a miracle, as the terrorists decided to leave after killing Yossi and not go inside.\nHe was buried on October 31 in Kibbutz Beit Guvrin. He is survived by his wife, Estela, their children Shahar, Natali and Omer and grandchildren Regev, Rotem and Noah.\nAccording to a kibbutz eulogy, Yossi grew up in Holon and met Estela — an Argentinian immigrant — at Kibbutz Beit Nir as part of a group of youth pioneers. The couple wed in 1981 and settled first in Holon for more than a decade, during which Yossi worked as an Egged driver.\nThat work, the kibbutz said, “birthed his love for the vistas of the land and its heritage,” which he regularly explored during motorcycle trips around the country. On those trips, which he led with a local motorcycle club, “he insisted on visiting memorial sites for Israel’s wars.”\nAfter moving to Nir Oz in the early 1990s, he worked in a number of different areas, including agriculture as well as community management and economic oversight, “and in all of them he stood out for his diligence and perseverance.” He was also an amateur photographer, the kibbutz added, snapping “beautiful photos which testified to his sensitivity and love for the views and the people.”\nA week before he was killed, Yossi bought a new motorcycle, which he barely had a chance to ride. On the day of the Hamas attack, Gazan looters stole the bike and brought it to the Strip.\nYossi’s friend Moshe Tal told the Kan public broadcaster, “Anything you can say about Yossi wouldn’t come close to what he really was. He was so much more. Love of the land, love of life, love of the kibbutz.”\nHis son Omer told Kan that “what made him wake up every morning with a smile on his face was the knowledge that on the weekend he would get on his motorcycle and take the country by storm.”\nAt his funeral, his daughter Natali said every weekend she would say she was tired and wanted to stay home, and her father would say “go out and travel, live a little. And then you’d start a dramatic and flowery description of the best trip you’d ever taken, with the most beautiful sunset, the most unique spring, and the funniest friends.”\nHis son, Shahar, a photographer, wrote in Israel Hayom that he picked up his love of the camera from his father. At his funeral, “friends eulogized him by recalling the camera that was always with him, documenting everything,” he wrote. “Thank you, Dad, for the love of photography, which was and still is a part of me all my life.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Daniel Shperber, 20, a surveillance balloon operator in the Border Defense Corps’s 414th unit from Yehud, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the Nahal Oz IDF outpost.\nDaniel was one of five balloon operators on duty that morning at the Nahal Oz outpost, along with Sgt. Shimon Lugasi, Staff Sgt. Alroy Ben Shitrit, Staff Sgt. Neta Baram and Sgt. Amir Eyal.\nThe five, who were responsible for operating a large white surveillance balloon that was supposed to collect information from deep inside Gaza, were waiting for a repair crew to arrive and fix the malfunctioning balloon when the Hamas invasion began.\nThe IDF has said it is investigating whether the balloons were merely malfunctioning or had been sabotaged by Hamas as part of its advance preparations for the onslaught.\nThe five balloonists fought back against the mass invasion of the outpost by Hamas terrorists, but heavily outnumbered, all five were killed in the battle waged from inside an on-base shelter.\nDaniel was slain one day after celebrating his 20th birthday — during which his mother visited him on base, snapping the last photo they would have together. He was buried on October 12 in Yehud.\nHe is survived by his parents, Liat and Gil, and his younger brother Noam, as well as two half siblings Atay and Eve.\nBorn and raised in Yehud, he was a huge fan of the Maccabi Haifa soccer team and he loved to hang out at the beach and the pool, watch horror movies and play computer games, according to a military eulogy.\nAfter finishing high school, he enlisted in the IDF and was placed in the Border Defense Corps’s 414th unit and trained as a balloon operator. He was first stationed in the Paga outpost next to Be’eri, although the balloon had a number of technical issues and was ultimately disabled. Daniel was then moved to the Nahal Oz outpost about two months before he was killed there.\nHis mother, Liat, told Haaretz that Daniel enjoyed his army posting and being near the kibbutz next door: “He would take a bathing suit to the base in the summer, and when they got permission, they would go to the Nahal Oz pool,” she said. “They liked being there. It gave me peace of mind that he wasn’t somewhere that made him depressed to return to base. He liked his job and liked his comrades.”\nShortly after his death, his younger brother, Noam, wrote on Instagram, “My dear and beloved brother. I know that you are now in a better place, and I hope that you’re watching over us from above and see how proud we are of you, and how much honor we are giving you because you saved entire families. I love you, my brother.”\nDaniel’s grandmother, Lucy, wrote online, “I miss you so much. I’m still waiting for the door to open with the keys in your hand. Your life was cut short too soon, all the plans that you planned on your breaks [from the army] when you came to visit us every two weeks will never come true. I miss you so much and I will love you forever.

    "story": "Bar Lior “Barli” Nakmuli, 27, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHe was considered missing for three days until his family was informed that his body had been found.\nLior was buried in Rehovot on October 12. He is survived by his parents, Nurit and Yossi.\nBorn in Mazkeret Batya, he moved with his mother when he was 8 to nearby Shoham, and he attended schools there and in Givatayim, according to a state eulogy.\nOn October 7, 2004, when he was 8 years old, he was vacationing with his father at the Taba Hilton in the Sinai when it was attacked by terrorists, who killed 34 people including 13 Israelis. Lior and his father survived. Nineteen years later, on the exact same date, Lior was slain.\nTall in stature, he was an active basketball player in his youth, including competing in tournaments abroad and later even coaching the team. During his mandatory army service, Lior served as a driver in the 16th Infantry Brigade.\nAfter his release, he worked at a number of restaurant jobs to save up for his “big trip,” which he spent traveling around South America — where he picked up a love for trance music and festivals.\nUpon his return to Israel, Lior decided to explore a professional culinary career, working in a number of restaurant jobs. He still always loved to host and cook for friends and loved ones, and he planned to pursue culinary studies in Paris, his family said.\nAt the time of his death, Lior worked as a cook at the ‘a’ restaurant in Tel Aviv. The restaurant’s head chef, Yuval Ben Neriah, told The Marker that four of his employees were at the Supernova festival but only Lior was killed.\n“He was only 27 years old, he worked for me for two years,” he said. “In his most recent job he was a grillman at ‘a.’ He was an incredible guy with a huge smile.” Ben Neriah said that in Lior’s honor, he turned his restaurants into prep kitchens — including undergoing kosher certification — to churn out thousands of free meals for soldiers and evacuees. “Inside every meal we include a postcard dedicated to the memory of Bar Lior.”\nHis friends also established a beer and wine bar, named Barli, in the city of Yavne in his honor, as well as started selling a T-shirt online emblazoned with his favorite flower, the sunflower, and a phrase he had recently tattooed on himself: “Don’t forget to breathe.”\nHis close friend, Doron Magali, wrote on Instagram that “Barli was my best friend. From the first moment. Such a fast and strong connection that I didn’t believe was possible.”\nDoron said they met traveling in South America, “and he adopted me into his group without asking anyone. ‘Don’t worry, you’re with me.’ And I really was with him. Inseparable since then until that dark Saturday.”\nLosing Lior, she wrote, “is the worst thing I could imagine, but I never imagined it happening…. Barli was the first person I would message when something happened to me. The first person I would call, the first who would help. And he’s suddenly not here.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Chava “Chavik” Segal, 78, was murdered by Hamas terrorists next to her home in Moshav Netiv Ha’asara on October 7.\nChavik, who lived in a unique home made of wood that lacked a reinforced room, ran for the backyard bomb shelter when the rocket fire began. Inside the shelter, she was shot dead in a hail of bullets by Hamas terrorists who had infiltrated the border town.\nShe was buried on October 19 in Kibbutz Ginegar in the Jezreel Valley. She is survived by her five children, Adi, Tzur, Noa, Hila and Ron, as well as 14 grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. She was predeceased by her husband, Yigal.\nAccording to a state eulogy, Chavik was raised in Kibbutz Ginegar, which is also where she met Yigal, her childhood sweetheart. After having their first two children, they decided to move to the Sinai Peninsula, settling in the settlement of Sadot just across the border from Rafah in 1972, where the couple’s next three children were born.\nThe family remained there for a decade until the settlement was evacuated in 1982 as part of the peace accord with Egypt, something Chavik’s loved ones said was a painful transition from which she never quite recovered.\nChavik was colorful and full of life, the eulogy notes, with an artistic soul she devoted to singing, drawing, sculpture, dancing, knitting and sewing. She had a close relationship with Bilha Inon, who was murdered that same day along with her husband, and the pair created mandala drawings together. She was also a dedicated swimmer who hit the pool daily.\nHer friend Smadar Harpaz Saad described her on Facebook as “Chavik, who knew how to fix a torn sock, to replace a fallen button, to nicely wrap up the item she embroidered for a grandson or granddaughter with colorful thread and include a note.”\n“Chavik to my shock is no longer here. But I have a little bit of Chavik in every one of her wonderful children, who are close to my heart like brothers and sisters, and in every one of her grandchildren, and even a bit in me… Her modesty. Her brevity. Her love expressed through actions and small gestures.”\nHer son, Ron, wrote online that the family quotes Chavik and Yigal “all the time. You were together more than 50 years, I hope your souls are carrying out a heavenly reunion.”\n“You left us so many songs to sing to remember you by, yet somehow most of us are tone deaf,” he continued. “You left us a sense of humor, you left simplicity and modesty, you left a wide heart, a love of the land and optimism. You left behind stubbornness and toughness.”\n“I see you in each of us kids, and in the sweet grandchildren,” Ron added. “Mom, you and Yigal were people of action. Your spirit is alive and kicking inside us. I want to believe that your soft and simple soul has found eternal rest.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Naor Siboni, 20, a Golani Brigade soldier from Gilat, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the Nahal Oz IDF outpost.\nWhen the rocket fire began, he messaged his family a photo of the sky streaked with missiles and told them he was fine, they said. Fifteen minutes later, his sister tried to phone him and he declined the call, writing to her, “Don’t call now, everything’s good.” That was their final communication.\nHis mother said they later found out that Naor, a marksman, headed up to the shooting position at the base, and saw in shock the hundreds of Hamas terrorists infiltrating the base. He ran to the bomb shelter to warn his comrades, and headed back to the post, only to find it had been destroyed by an RPG. Naor’s platoon commander, Lt. Yohai Dukhan told Naor to use the bomb shelter as a base from which to battle the invading terrorists. He did so until he was shot, and his friends dragged him inside, where they treated him for several hours until he was killed when Hamas gunmen threw a grenade into the shelter.\nNaor was buried in Gilat on October 11. He is survived by his parents, Dakar and Tzila Siboni, and his siblings Dor, Rotem and Eliya.\nA eulogy on the Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team website said Naor had “a heart of gold, a heart of yellow,” the team’s colors. “A die-hard devotee of Maccabi Tel Aviv and a fan of [singer] Eyal Golan.” Naor “had a smile that lit up every heart, one full of love that immediately caused a smile in return. A kind and special ray of sunshine unique to him.”\nNaor’s sister, Rotem, wrote to him on Instagram a little over a month after he was killed: “Thank you that in our final conversation, you told me everything was OK, that you didn’t go and leave me worried.”\n“Thank you for the privilege of visiting you the day before and bringing you all sorts of treats you love, and for the hug and the kiss that since that Saturday are missing like air to breathe,” she wrote. “Thank you that a week before you made me go out with you to the techno club, who could even believe it of me?… Thank you, my love, for being my little brother. For being there for me in every moment, for appreciating what I did for you, for always telling me that you love me with yellow hearts, thank you for everything.”\nHis mother, Tzila, told Ynet that Naor “was unafraid, was sharp and goal-oriented, he killed many terrorists until he fell heroically.”\n“Since Naor died,” she said, “I keep hearing more and more stories about the immense love for people he had.”\n“Naor, as all his acquaintances attest, was compassionate and kind and saw every person as a human being,” Tzila added. “Even in his childhood, he would open our home to children who were ostracized at school, and during his military service, he continued to assist lone soldiers and those in need.”\n“He used to give in secret, share food and drink with his friends, and take care of anyone who lacked money or clothing. Naor always reiterated that the verse ‘Love your neighbor as yourself’ was the one he placed in front of him, and he acted according to it until his last day.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 286 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

Another friend, Keshet Casarotti-Kalfa, who tried to flee with them, was also murdered in the onslaught.\nUntil Orion’s body was returned to Israel, his family had held out hope that he was alive and being held hostage. They never saw any sign of life during his captivity, but they had received messages from Hamas from his phone implying that he was alive and held hostage.\nAfter being returned to Israel, his body was flown on May 28, 2024, to Mexico for burial.\nHe is survived by his parents, Sergio Hernández, and his mother, Marie-Pascale Radoux, as well as his 2-year-old daughter.\nOrion was born in the central Mexican state of Morelos and had dual nationality from his French-born mother.\nA DJ and event producer, he met Shani at a music festival in Europe, and the couple were together for eight months before they were killed. Orion had arrived in Israel just a few days before the Supernova festival to reunite with Shani and enjoy the rave together.\nThe Hostages Families Forum said Orion “had a deep love for music and dancing, worked as a music producer and visited music festivals around the world.”\nAccording to the Spanish-language La Nacion news site, Orion had been traveling around Europe with a group of eight friends for several months before they arrived in Israel. The group had organized a music festival in September in Thermos, Greece, and traveled for months in an RV including stops in France, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Hungary and Croatia.\nIn an interview with the Milenio newspaper in Mexico, Orion’s mother said she wanted her son to be remembered as a “great warrior, someone who was very free ever since he was little. He was always rebellious, he was always difficult to educate, to control, was always very free and was not afraid of anything. He was resilient and had a lot of energy to become a warrior from a young age.”\nPascale said her son loved horror films, and once asked her to buy him the creepy Chucky doll for Christmas: “He had the face of an angel, but he went around with his Chucky doll, and it came off as strange. He looked for scorpions, deadly spiders, he was temperamental,” she recalled.\n“He never went looking for a war or anything like that, he was pure love.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Roy Bareket, 20, a squad commander in the Golani Brigade, from Tel Aviv, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the Nahal Oz IDF base.\nAccording to his family, Roy was on duty that Saturday morning, and with the start of the attack, he and nine other combat soldiers got in an armored personnel carrier and headed toward the Gaza border, battling with invading terrorists and suffering a hit from an RPG. The soldiers decided to head toward the Nahal Oz base to help battle the Hamas invasion there, along the way engaging in intense battles with cells of terrorists.\nAt the base, the soldiers drove the APC inside, running over terrorists in their wake but quickly realizing how outnumbered they were against the Hamas invasion, and that the heavily damaged APC was no match. Seven of them got out to battle the terrorists face-to-face near the gate of the IDF base, and most were shot dead by gunfire.\nRoy was killed in the battle along with his commander, Maj. Shilo Har-Even, Staff Sgt. Dvir Zakai, Staff Sgt. Dor Yarhi, Staff Sgt. Yishay Fitusi and Staff Sgt. Yaad Ben Yaakov.\nRoy was buried on October 12 in Tel Aviv. He is survived by his parents, Liat and Yaron, and his siblings Mika and Ori.\nWriting in a eulogy on the Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team website, his parents described him as a “redhead with dimples who was full of energy, who loved sports from a young age and inherited from home a love of Maccabi Tel Aviv,” purchasing season tickets and trying to make it to every game, even while in the army.\nHe played both soccer and basketball in his youth, they said, and was also an active participant and later counselor in his local scout troop, who loved hanging out at the beach and surfing.\nRoy’s father Yaron, told Israel Hayom that since his son was killed, he travels far and wide “telling the story of Roy’s heroic battle.”\n“This is my mission,” he said. “I want people to know about the sacrifice and the bravery of my son and the commanders and soldiers who were with him. This generation, who we all thought were living for themselves, came and sacrificed everything and fought with supreme bravery… it needs to be told everywhere it can be.”\nHis mother, Liat, told Israel Hayom that Roy “was always charismatic, a boy who loved life, who got alone with everyone, but [since he was killed] we’ve heard from people things we didn’t know, stories about Roy, and it’s incredible how many sides there were to this kid.”\nLiat said that the family “knew our Roy, but it turns out everyone who met him had their own Roy… Roy knew how to get along with everyone and be loved by all. The redheaded kid from Tzhala [an upscale neighborhood of north Tel Aviv], whose closest friends included the platoon commander from [the West Bank settlement of] Kiryat Arba, friends from all different backgrounds, different lives, Roy simply found himself with everyone — it was an amazing quality.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 289 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

When the rocket fire started, the three left for their car and had reached the Mefalsim junction when Shahar was shot by terrorists lying in wait, and the car flipped.\nSharon told her family that Shahar had been killed by the gunfire, and she and Oriya were trying to hide, but the two women were later murdered by Hamas, as was Sharon’s brother, Eli, who had come to try and save them and was also shot dead.\nShahar was buried on October 11 in Hadid, two weeks before his 29th birthday. He is survived by his parents, Hanita and Yehuda, and his three sisters, Amit, Gal and Tamar.\nRaised in Shoham, he enlisted first in the Golani Brigade during his mandatory IDF service, before moving to a role in the Technological and Logistics Directorate, according to a state eulogy. After his release from the army, Shahar worked for a period at a restaurant before traveling to the US, where he worked in real estate.\nAfter a year, he returned to Israel and decided to study to become an electrician, joining his father in the family business.\nSharon and Shahar met in 2023 and quickly became a couple, moving in together in Ramat Gan not long before they were murdered. Her older sister, Livnat, told Ynet that “the day she met Shahar she knew he was the one for her. She introduced him to the family as ‘my future husband,’ and we were so happy for her.”\nShahar’s family said that he told them a week before he was killed that he planned to propose to Sharon at some point in 2024. Sharon, they said, had already saved Shahar’s mother’s phone number as “my future mother-in-law.”\nHis sister, Tamar, wrote on Instagram six months after he was murdered that she was “still waiting for you.”\n“Still waiting for you to show up on Friday night for kiddush, waiting to curl up on the couch with you, waiting to feel you again, waiting for my big brother to come back to me already,” she wrote.\n“I miss you so much Shaharoni. The more time passes, the harder it gets. Every moment of the day I think of you, miss you and do everything I can so you would be proud of me,” added Tamar. “But I still keep waiting. For your hug, which was the strongest in the world. For the wedding of you and Sharon. For you getting annoyed at me for bugging you about eating healthy and quitting smoking. For our car rides at full volume. I’ll keep waiting for all these moments.”\nWriting on Facebook in June, his mother, Hanita, spoke of “eight months of endless longing.”\n“A huge hole in my heart that only grows bigger. I dreamed that we’d do so many more things together, and without any warning one morning you just disappeared,” she wrote. “Our daily life looks different, holidays and Shabbats no longer have your vibe, with joy and endless energy.”\n“You are in my heart every second, if only it could be different,” Hanita added. “Rest in peace and keep sending me little signs — I love you and miss you with all my heart.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Yuval Buyum, 21, from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in his home in the kibbutz on October 7.\nYuval was living in the youth wing of the kibbutz and told his father the morning of the attack that he could hear terrorists walking around outside trying to enter. He was holding on to the handle of his reinforced room, he told his dad, to try to prevent them from entering.\nNot long after 12 p.m., Yuval stopped answering his father’s texts. Early the next morning, Yuval’s parents and siblings were rescued from their reinforced room in the kibbutz, but nobody had any word of Yuval. Only five days later were they informed that he had been murdered and his body was identified.\nYuval was buried in Kibbutz Shefayim on October 15. He is survived by his parents, Tamar and Ilan, and his siblings Guy, 24, and Elad, 15.\nA talented musician and piano player, he devoted most of his waking hours to music, said his loved ones, exploring classical songs as well as modern ones and composing his own tunes. He was sensitive and gentle, they said, and always willing to lend a hand to others.\nHis cousin, Noa Fink, wrote on Facebook to “Yuvali, my beloved cousin.”\n“How much light and creativity you brought to the family,” she added. “A man who was all peace and love, killed in war. It’s impossible to comprehend, a nightmare come true, just painful and awful.”\nHis close friend and musical partner, Eran Keren, wrote on Facebook that they spent a great deal of time together in the studio, where they would always be referred to as “Buyum and Eran.”\n“You were my musical partner for the past decade, we exchanged notes, we exchanged albums, and I built a deep friendship with you that was just… You were a little different from all the others. We both knew how to talk about everything, the fears, the aspirations, the deeper things. A pair of slightly artistic kids who were music fanatics in a way that most people can’t really understand.”\nYuval, he wrote, “was a great musician in every respect, modest in a way you wouldn’t believe, with a great deal of desire and aspiration for perfection, even amid crises, an incredible and dedicated teacher to all your students and a true friend.” He recalled “the all-nighters in the Sha’ar Hanegev studio, the performances, the laughter, the times we sat at your place in the youth wing, sharing thoughts on life, stupid humor, and of course music, the basis of everything. I know that anytime I approach any instrument, you will be in my thoughts.”\nHis father, Ilan, said Yuval was in such a positive place musically and personally before he was killed.\n“Yuval’s soul was always wrapped up in music, when he was in school he spent hours on the piano,” Ilan, told the Walla news outlet. “Everyone in the music studio in Sha’ar Hanegev knew him. He headed a project of singing Matti Caspi songs in nursery schools.”\nAfter Yuval completed his mandatory army service, Ilan said, “he returned to the studio as a piano teacher. In recent months Yuval was blossoming in music and in general. He had a new love in his life. He was glowing with happiness which affected all those around him and infected us all with joy. There was light simply flowing from him.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Cpt. Rom Shlomi, 23, an officer in the Israeli Air Force’s elite Shaldag unit from Ganot, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nRom and a number of other Shaldag fighters, led by Maj. Ido Yehoshua, were sent to the Re’im IDF base, which houses the Gaza Division, to try and seize control back from the terrorist invaders, and to rescue the soldiers, commanders and a number of civilians who were holed up inside.\nRom and Ido were both killed in the fierce firefight. Israel ultimately regained control of the base later that evening.\nRom was buried on October 11 in Ahiezer. He is survived by his parents, Michal and Shai, and his siblings Tal and Gur.\nBorn and raised in the small Moshav Ganot in central Israel, Rom loved to go off-road biking, as well as complete manual labor around the moshav, according to a Shaldag eulogy.\nRom didn’t fit well into a traditional school structure and moved from school to school, never quite finding his place, his loved ones said. He preferred to be off on his bike in the wilderness, but when he finally made it to the army, things turned around.\nHe enlisted in the Israeli Air Force in 2018, later completing an officer’s course and serving as an officer at the Israeli Air Force’s special forces school, and “stood out for his concern for his soldiers, his well-developed cooking skills and for being a good friend,” according to the Shaldag eulogy.\nHis childhood friend, Yam Fadlon, wrote on Facebook, “To me, Rom was a kid without fear. To me, Rom was the boy who did everything first. To me, Rom was a true prankster — to me, Rom was childhood.” They were born 10 days apart, he said, going through together “a wonderful childhood full of experiences.”\nRom’s brother, Gur, wrote on Instagram to, “My brother, my beloved, my blood brother.”\n“It’s hard to believe that you, the best soldier in the whole unit, the soldier who just signed on for his third year in regular service, was no longer,” he wrote. “You went through a huge change in the army, from an annoying kid to the manliest of men — there’s nothing like it.”\n“Rom, my brother, I love you and I still can’t comprehend what happened,” Gur added. “I want to say thank you for all the messages you taught me, for the experience you gave me for all of life. I want to believe that you’re always with me, no matter what. I love you, my brother.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Michael Murzakhanov, 69, from Netivot, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Shaar Hanegev Junction on October 7.\nMichael, a doctor, left the house early that morning to head to his job at the Shikma prison in Ashkelon. Despite his wife’s pleas to stay home after the early morning rocket fire, Michael headed out at 7 a.m., and his family never saw or heard from him again.\nAfter searching, his family found his car on the side of the road near the Shaar Hanegev Junction with bullet holes and pools of blood, but no sign of Michael. Only 10 days later, were they finally informed that his body had been found and identified. His son said that officials told them it had been difficult to identify him because he had been shot in the face.\nMichael was buried in Beersheba. He is survived by his wife, Nina, their three children, Stanislav, Sergey and Wasily, and seven grandchildren.\nBorn in Mozdok, in the former Soviet Union, Michael grew up with his twin brother, Edward, and siblings Alexei, Rachel and Dina, according to a state eulogy. Already at age 15, he began his pre-med studies in Chechnya, where he later worked as a paramedic. At 18 he was enlisted in the Soviet Army and served in a hospital in Tbilisi. Upon completion of his army service, he began medical studies at the University of St. Petersburg, where he met he met his wife, Nina.\nThe couple wed in 1979 and had three sons as Michael began his medical career. They moved to Crimea, but later decided to make aliya to Israel. The boys immigrated in the early 2000s under the aegis of the Jewish Agency, and Michael and Nina followed in 2003, according to a eulogy from the Israeli Medical Association.\nThe family’s adjustment to Israel was a little rocky, in particular learning a new language, but Michael managed to transfer his doctor’s license and worked in a number of jobs before settling into work with the prison system.\n“Dr. Murzakhanov was a man full of joy for life, charismatic, intellectual, physically and spiritually strong,” said the IMA. “His family said nobody could remain indifferent in the face of his optimism and the endless positive energy he spread to all. He always supported and helped his friends and family in their time of need.”\nMichael, the IMA eulogy continued, “was an incredible family man, gave his whole soul to his family — was a warm husband to Nina, a role model to his children and a loving grandfather to his grandchildren… the medical profession served as a mission and a huge responsibility to him.”\nIn his free time he loved to play chess, teaching it also to his grandchildren, and he always stayed in shape and exercised his entire life, said loved ones, including being an active table tennis player.\nIn a video memorial, his middle son, Sergey, said that Michael was a “loving father, a caring father, he had a huge amount of charisma, that affected everyone around him.” No matter how hard he worked, he said, “he also found the time to take Mom and to come visit us and help us, all three of us, with the grandchildren.”\nHis wife, Nina, said in the video, “I’m a pessimist and he was an optimist. Together we would solve problems, we’d decide on things together.” Together, she said, “we decided to move to Israel to ensure a future for our children.”\n“He was my other half,” she said. “We used to go everywhere together, always the two of us, and now… we were together 44 years, almost 45. He was so kind, he was very sincere. He wanted to help people. As a husband, he was very gentle and caring.

    "story": "Elad Katzir, 47, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was kidnapped on October 7 and murdered in captivity in Gaza.\nHis body was retrieved by the IDF during an operation on April 5, 2024.\nThe IDF said that according to its intelligence, Elad was “murdered in captivity by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group.” The IDF estimated that he was killed by his captors in mid-January. He was then buried in the Khan Younis refugee camp in southern Gaza, and his body was exhumed and brought back to Israel for burial by troops of the Maglan and Egoz commando units.\nElad was in his home the day of the Hamas invasion, and told his sister that terrorists had entered his home during their last conversation. While in captivity, Islamic Jihad released two forced propaganda videos of Elad, in December 2023 and January 2024.\nElad’s father, Rami Katzir, was murdered on October 7 in Nir Oz and his mother, Hanna Katzir, was kidnapped and released as part of a truce deal in late November.\nHe was buried in Kibbutz Nir Oz on April 7. He is survived by his mother, Hanna, and his sisters, Avital and Carmit.\nA farmer, a social activist and a devoted fan of the Maccabi Haifa soccer team, Elad volunteered for the Hadar Foundation, showing up each week to support the fight for the release of Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul, two soldiers whose bodies have been held in Gaza for more than 10 years.\n“Elad was a man of laughter, hugs and happiness, fields and land,” the kibbutz said in a statement announcing his death. “He was especially loved by the kibbutz’s children, members and residents.”\nHis niece, Shaked, wrote on Facebook to “the uncle that everyone would want to have: the cool uncle who let you have alcohol at 13, who flew with you for your first time abroad, who let you drive way before you got your license. Who took you to a pub, to a restaurant, a movie, for a drive on the tractor in a field. Who taught you to swim, and who also almost drowned in the pool.”\nAnd despite all that, she said, “you were an educational figure. You taught us how to lighten the mood and at the same time to look at things seriously, you taught us the values of loving the land, people, the earth, values of partnership, of shared responsibility, of helping others. A man whose values were his actions and his work.”\nHer uncle, Shaked wrote, “was freedom. You were an 18-year-old kid in the body of a 40 year old. You always followed your heart and didn’t do what was expected of you. You had a heart of gold. You were one of those people for whom the good inside them is a way of life.”\nElad’s sister, Carmit, described him on Facebook as “our Elad. A devoted son, a loving brother, the coolest and most dedicated uncle there was. A friend to so many people.”\n“Eladi, may the memory of you be of laughter, hugs and joy, fields and soil,” she wrote. “That is not how your story ought to have ended.

Nehoray Levi Amitay, 20, a squad commander in the Golani Brigade from Rinatya, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the Nahal Oz IDF outpost.\nNehoray was on duty at the Nahal Oz base when the Hamas onslaught began, and his family said he helped to battle the invasion of dozens of terrorists of the outpost. At a certain point in the fighting, they said, he arrived at a bomb shelter which was also overrun by Hamas gunmen.\nThere he continued to battle the terrorists despite being wounded in his hand, and was then shot a second time but kept fighting, before he was wounded a third time and killed, his family said.\nHe was buried on October 12 in Yehud. He is survived by his parents, Hagit and Harel, and his siblings Matan, Itamar and Maya, as well as his girlfriend Hagar.\nBorn and raised in Rinatya, a small moshav in central Israel, he attended high school in nearby Shoham, focusing his studies on sports and biology, according to an online eulogy.\nHe loved skateboarding and soccer, especially his beloved Beitar Jerusalem team, his family said.\nHis girlfriend of the past three years, Hagar Toledo, wrote on Instagram to “Nehoray, the love of my life.”\n“We didn’t need anyone or anything else, just each other,” she wrote. “Our love blossomed from true and real friendship, and it was clear from the beginning that this was it. Nothing could stop us — not the difference in our lifestyles, the distance we had to live with during our army service, the longing and the time were weak in the face of our bond.”\nTheir plans for the future included just each other, she wrote.  “We weren’t thinking of a big trip for self-discovery, just the two of us in southern Italy with pizza, that was enough. We wanted to find a studio apartment in the moshav, close enough to our families, to call it home, because a room is just a room, the togetherness is home.”\n“I love you, my beautiful face, my guardian angel, the soul that was too good for this world, my soulmate, who would argue with me until the middle of the night until I’d fold and agree to accept that you love me more,” she added. “I miss you with all my heart.”\nHis mother, Hagit, wrote online to “Nehoray, my wonderful boy, who never did anything bad to anyone, with a constant smile on his face.”\n“My beautiful boy, with innocent blue eyes who loved the army and fought on behalf of his soldiers until the last moment, until he was wounded and couldn’t help his soldiers anymore,” she wrote.\n“The whole family has such longing, you’ve left such a hole in our hearts,” Hagit added. “It’s still hard to believe that you won’t come home. I still keep waiting for you to walk in and hug me and tell me it was a mistake and that you’re OK. I’m waiting for you to open the window of my room like you did the last time you came home and say ‘Mom’ with a smile on your face, and I’ll just hug you one more time and give you lots of kisses and smell you once more.

    "story": "Amir Manzhor Naim, 27, from Kibbutz Erez, was killed battling the Hamas attack on the kibbutz on October 7.\nA member of the kibbutz’s local security team, Amir set out early that morning to join the rest of the team and repel the dozens of terrorists who were heading their way.\n“We were hiding in our safe room and as soon as Amir understood that something unusual was happening, he jumped up, got ready in two minutes, and went out to handle things. We didn’t even have a chance to say a proper goodbye,” his wife, Shahar, told The Times of Israel in February.\nThe team gathered at the highest point in the kibbutz, from which they could see two pickup trucks full of terrorists heading their way, another member of the squad, Ben Sadan, told Ynet. They opened fire on them and a ferocious gunfight ensued, with “grenades, RPGs, insane gunfire,” he said. In the battle, Amir was wounded and died “in my arms.”\nNobody else in the kibbutz was killed, and the security team successfully repelled the Hamas invasion.\nAmir was buried on October 18, 2023, in Rishon Lezion, and is slated to be reburied on October 8, 2024, in Kibbutz Erez. He was retroactively recognized as a fallen soldier with the rank of major in the reserves.\nHe is survived by his wife, Shahar, his parents, Orna and Asher and his older siblings, Moran and Dekel. His firstborn son, Refael, was born in April 2024, six months after he was killed.\nShahar’s cousin, Tal Keren, was murdered the same day while fishing at Zikim Beach.\nBorn and raised in Kibbutz Erez, Amir stood out for being tall and broad, and played basketball for many years as a kid, often referred to by his nickname of “rhino.” During his mandatory army service, he served in the Yahalom unit of the Combat Engineering Corps, working in its bomb disposal unit. He later became an officer, and after his release was an active reservist in the Golani Brigade.\nAmir was in his final year of studying chemical engineering at the Shamoon College of Engineering in Beersheba and was also working a student job at Intel.\nHis family chose to memorialize him in a number of ways connected to his interests, including a local basketball tournament, a hackathon aimed at finding usage for salt created as a byproduct from water desalination, and a line of beers with a rhinoceros logo. He also loved smoking meat in his backyard, hosting friends for large barbecues and taking jeep trips in the desert, his loved ones said.\nAmir’s cousin, Gal Naim, told People magazine, “He was just a very kind person that you could always count on. He always had your back. He reminded me why we came to this country because you’re always with your family…. we remember him for all the happy moments and all the family pictures.”\nHis sister, Moran, wrote on Facebook that her brother “always understood me, always made me laugh no matter what — even when we were in the middle of a stormy fight, in which you were of course always right.”\n“My brother, with the huge smile, the rolling laughter and the kind eyes,” she continued. “The most determined — always first! I’m so proud of you. You are my hero, you are a hero to all of us… There are no words to describe how much I love you. Forever.”\nAmir and Shahar were together for a decade, ever since high school when they met on a school heritage trip to Poland. They settled in Erez, Amir’s hometown, and were excited to start building their family together.\nShahar said she felt her husband’s absence at every doctor’s appointment, test, and scan on the journey toward their son’s birth.\n“Amir left me and the whole family a huge gift and that makes me take good care of myself and the baby, who is a pinpoint of light I am waiting to meet,” she said in February, a few months before he was born.\nShahar told Channel 12 news that “it pains me that [Rafael] won’t experience having a father. He will experience a father — just one who isn’t physically here.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Shoham Yaakov, 29, her sister Shenhav Yaakov, 26, from Herzliya, and their nephew Liel Jerafi, 18, from Jerusalem, were murdered by Hamas at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nShoham and Shenhav were both working as part of the festival’s production staff, and they invited Liel to join them at the rave.\nWhen the rocket fire began, the three decided to flee the site via car, and at some point stopped to seek safety in a roadside bomb shelter. They were all slain inside the shelter along with dozens of others when Hamas terrorists threw grenades inside and opened fire on the huddled partygoers.\nTwo brothers in the family headed down to the Supernova site to try and find their loved ones that Saturday morning, encountering roadblocks, cops and IDF troops who tried to convince them to turn around. They searched for hours and hours but kept coming up empty handed.\nFor a week, the family couldn’t find any trace of the three despite constant searching. A week after the massacre, Shenhav’s body was identified, and a day later Liel and Shoham were also confirmed killed.\nShoham was buried in Herzliya on October 15, and Shenhav was buried next to her a day later, on October 16. Liel was buried in Beit Shemesh on October 16.\nThe sisters are survived by their parents, Rachel and Neria Yehiel, and their seven older siblings, Dudu, Avishag, Dvir, Sapir, Ohad, Elad and Hadas.\nLiel is survived by his parents, Dudu and Nardit, and his younger siblings Adir, 14, Itay, 9 and Shaylee, 7.\nBorn and raised in the Kiryat Yovel neighborhood of Jerusalem, Liel focused his high school studies on cyber communications, and was slated to soon enlist in the IDF, aiming for a spot in the prestigious 8200 intelligence unit.\n“He really loved computers, he was always on the computer,” his father, Dudu, told a local Jerusalem news site. “He was supposed to join 8200 and all his future was ahead of him. He had a big future, he was an excellent student. A smart kid, kind and quiet.”\nDudu said Liel’s younger siblings “loved him so much. He was a true firstborn, he would take care of them, talk to them, advise them. He was a role model for them, he was modest, not one who partied much, even though he was murdered at a festival.” His father said, “I miss his smile, his laughter, the nonsense he loved. I think about him all the time, about his positive spirit and his joy for life.”\nEleven months after he was killed, Liel’s mother, Nardit, wrote on Facebook to “my angel in heaven.”\n“It’s already a year without you, a year of longing and endless pain, a year that your voice has been silent,” she wrote. “You left an empty space and a hole in my heart in the shape of you, my beautiful angel… Liel, my heart breaks anew every day. I miss you so much.”\nShoham and Shenhav were very close to each other and the rest of the family, were huge fans of the Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team and loved to go out partying together, their loved ones said.\nAvishag, their older sister, told Israel Hayom that Shoham and Shenhav lived every moment of their short lives to the fullest.\n“Shoham was very serious on the one hand, but also loved to laugh, to live big and to take life by storm. She dreamed big. She was a personal trainer and a nutritionist, it was important to her to instill in others a healthy lifestyle. She dedicated her life to exercise and even learned boxing,” said Avishag.\n“She was always working on herself, she took big trips to faraway places. During our happiest moments, during holidays and vacations, she was the family photographer, she captured every moment,” she added.\nShenhav, the youngest of the nine siblings, was “our baby, who arrived after four brothers and four sisters,” said Avishag.\n“She saw day-to-day life as boring and she had big dreams,” she said. “She wanted to explore the world, to fly to Australia for a long period. She was an incredible baker, for every birthday she would make my daughter a gorgeous cake. She also planned to open a bakery.”\nThe two sisters, she said, “were the centers of our lives, they were so close to each other from childhood until the moment they were murdered. They were opposites who completed each other, the sun and the moon — each of them lit up the world in their own way.”\nHadar Cohen, a niece to Shoham and Shenhav, wrote on Instagram how hard it was to come to terms with the fact that “the aunts who were always there for me, and always hung out with me, and took care of me, and made me laugh, and were my best friends — but so much more — are no longer here.”\n“My aunts who were the most beautiful, kindest, successful and funny are not around anymore,” she added. “Those who raised me and also sort of grew up with me, Shenhav who tried unsuccessfully to teach me Justin Bieber songs, and Shoham who would drive even an hour so I could braid her hair before she’d go to a festival.”\n“My aunts who taught me what unconditional love was, who always took care of me and wanted the best for me — they’re not coming back and I didn’t even get to say goodbye,” she added.\n“We miss Shoham and Shenhav and Liel all the time, at every holiday, at every event,” their brother and uncle, Ohad, told i24 news in August. “Their loss is strongly felt in every moment of our lives. Our family will never return to what it was.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 298 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Bar Rozenshtein, 20, a Golani Brigade soldier from Rishon Lezion, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nBar and several of his comrades were on a routine patrol near the border in an armored jeep when the Hamas invasion began, according to a memorial website set up by his family. They headed back toward their outpost near Kibbutz Kissufim and were attacked by gunfire, and the jeep was hit by an RPG. They continued to fight regardless and decided to head toward the kibbutz to try and protect the civilians there. Along the way, Bar was shot dead, and his comrades recovered his body in order to bring it to the outpost.\nBar was buried on October 10 in Rishon Lezion. He is survived by his parents, Fani and Yossi, his younger siblings Rotem, 17, and Shaked, 12, and his girlfriend Noa.\nBorn and raised in Rishon, his family said he had a number of hobbies growing up, including playing computer games, experimenting in the kitchen, listening to rap music, enjoying anime comics, and he also loved to both play and watch basketball.\nHis sister, Rotem, wrote online to “my brother, my best friend, my partner in hamburgers.”\n“The person who would move the whole world if he heard something happened to me,” she continued. “I learned so much from you, I always walked in your footsteps. Anything you ever said to me was always sacred, because you always knew everything… everywhere I go I will always tell people what a brother I had, and what mental strength you had… you always knew how to calm things down and to say the right words.”\nMore than a month after he was killed, his mother, Fani wrote on Instagram that despite it being a Friday, “my regular routine has changed from one end to another.”\n“Instead of entering the kitchen and cooking with a desire to pamper you and give you anything you want when you come home for Shabbat, I’m preparing just a little bit because I have to,” she wrote. “Instead of getting your room ready for you — and you swore the only thing ever missing were towel swans on your bed — I come to visit your new home [gravesite], and clean the sand off the flags which cover you and arrange the shirt you loved so much over you, and get to know the new friends you have laying near you… I miss you so much and I love you to the core of my soul.”\nFani told a local news site in January that Bar “was an incredibly smart boy, even though he didn’t love studying, he did the maximum and finished high school” with intensive studies in both physics and robotics “without putting in any effort, everything came easily to him. He really loved playing on the computer, arguing about who was the best player ever in the NBA (he said Lebron James) and in in soccer (he said Ronaldo).”\nBar, she said, “was on the one hand super responsible, on the other hand a prankster, the funniest guy in the world. He carefully planned his civilian life after his release from the army, but he also still collected POP dolls and watched tons of anime series. Bar loved justice, he was very competitive and did what he wanted but in a respectful way. And even though he was a computer champ, Bar refused to pursue such a role in the IDF because he wanted to be a combat soldier. He may have only been 20 when he was killed, but he was the manliest boy there was.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Ron Benjamin, 53, from Rehovot, was murdered by Hamas terrorists near the Gaza border on the morning of October 7.\nHe was considered missing for many months, with no trace of him found following the attack. His family was informed in December that he was believed to be held hostage in Gaza.\nA few months later, the IDF assessed that Ron was shot dead near the Mefalsim Junction while heading home from a planned bike ride near Kibbutz Be’eri, and his body was kidnapped to Gaza. His remains were recovered by IDF troops in an operation on May 16, 2024, alongside those of Amit Buskila, Shani Louk and Itzhak Gelerenter.\nHe was buried on May 20, 2024, in Kibbutz Palmahim. He is survived by his wife, Ayelet, and their two daughters, Shai and Gil, as well as his mother, Chana, brother Shuki and sister Iris.\nHe worked as a salesman for the Champion Motors car company, where he also met his wife; the couple had been married for 27 years. He was a longtime amateur drummer and avid bike rider, who most of all loved spending time with his family, said loved ones.\nIn an interview with Ayelet while he was considered missing to At Magazine, she said that during the two months that his fate was unknown, “the girls and I started to think what kind of funeral Ron would want, what song he would choose to play at his funeral. It was hard, Ron is a huge music fan.”\nAyelet said their life as a small family of four “was easy, work, pilates classes, trips. We were a very normative couple. We loved to go out on Thursday or Friday nights to pubs.”\nWith news that he was considered a hostage, the family’s hopes soared of one day seeing him alive again, until the tragic news arrived in May when his body was recovered.\nHis elder daughter, Shai, told the Kan public broadcaster the day before his funeral that she was “happy to know that he was murdered on October 7 and he wasn’t suffering there all this time, it’s a comfort to know he didn’t suffer, that at least it was fast.”\nShai said she had dreamed that one day her father “would walk me down the aisle, would be a grandfather to my kids, he would have been a great grandfather.” Ron, she said, “was really the best dad in the world, a full-time father. He always wanted to know what was going on with us.”\nAt his funeral, his younger daughter, Gil, eulogized him as “a caring father, loving, funny with a huge heart. If only I could have one more hug, one more joke, just to call you ‘Dad’ one last time. I’m sorry I wasn’t there to save you, to warn you, to help. You will be missed with my every breath.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

He began to oversee the evacuation of the partygoers, but when the scope of the invasion became clear, he decided to try and save four of his workers and they got in a car and fled via the forest.\nWhen they were attacked by Hamas gunfire, he told the others to get out of the car and he continued driving, drawing their fire and allowing all four to escape with their lives.\nDavid was buried on October 10 at the Tel Regev cemetery outside Haifa. He is survived by his wife, Julia, his son from a previous marriage, Adrian, 7, and his stepdaughter, Barbara, as well as his parents, Natalia and Michael, and his sister Ksenia.\nBorn in Zlatoust, Russia, David moved to Israel at age 15 in 2003 with his father, settling in Haifa. He trained in judo for many years, and even earned a certification in judo instruction from the Wingate Institute. He worked as a security guard since he was young, working his way through the ranks to oversee a staff of other guards.\nHis friend, Olga Paradenko, wrote online of their “17 years of friendship, endless memories, some from the teenage years, were cut short when you went to work to secure the Nova festival. Even though we weren’t so close in recent times, we always knew that we would be there for each other.”\nIn a video played at a state Memorial Day service, his ex-wife, Vika, said that David “was very ambitious, he was always goal-oriented, he always knew how to achieve his goals. He never rested for a moment, he was always looking for the next challenge, the next aspiration.”\n“He was a father who loved to take our son to hang out, he was a kid himself, he loved playing with him, to goof around with him,” she added. “He was a guy who always made you feel safe, it made sense that he worked in security, you always felt secure with him,” she said, noting that he was a dominant father figure to his stepdaughter as well after he married Julia following their divorce.\nHis sister, Ksenia, told a Russian-language news outlet that her brother’s bravery saved the lives of the four people with him.\n“He was cheerful, kind, never refused to help. He always helped us,” she said. “He loved children very much. He always sent gifts for birthdays. He was generous — he paid for our trips to Israel. He joked, he laughed. He was strong and very big! He was kind, but fair and savvy — you couldn’t fool him.”\nHe had a number of tribulations in life, she said, “but ultimately he was able to get back on his feet and gradually find his place. He had many friends.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 301 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

The friends tried to hide together in a ditch near the site of the festival, but were cruelly murdered by the terrorists.\nHer body was discovered and identified several days later.\nRotem was buried on October 11 in Yokneam. She is survived by her mother, Ariella, and her brothers Elad and Guy. Her father, Ofer, died suddenly of a heart attack when Rotem was 8.\nBorn and raised in Yokneam, Rotem served in the Border Police during her mandatory military service, and also completed a squad commander’s course, according to a state eulogy. Despite enjoying her time in the Border Police, Rotem decided to leave at the end of the mandatory period and travel the world, intending to return to the police force later, her family said.\nIn the year and a half before she was killed, Rotem spent several months in the US, then traveled with her mother to Morocco, and in January 2023 she headed off for eight months in South America, returning a few months before the Supernova festival. Rotem had already purchased tickets to Mexico to celebrate her 23rd birthday in December 2023.\nHer grandfather, Shlomo, told a local news site that he was especially close to Rotem after her father — his son — died suddenly, “and since her murder the sadness is enormous… we hung photos of Rotem in every room of the house, she is with us, she was really close to me. She didn’t have a father, so I tried to fill that huge void for her.”\nEven when Rotem was traveling the world, he said, “she would always call and tell me what she was doing and where she was… I love traveling and she knew that, so maybe that’s why she always updated me and told me, I experienced her trip through our conversations.”\nHis granddaughter, he said, “was a fighter, she was an athlete and we believe she could have run to save herself, but with her heart there’s no way she would have left her friends.” At her funeral, he said, he introduced himself to her friends “as Rotem’s grandfather, and they immediately said, ‘Oh, Grandpa Shlomo,’ and they told me how much she would talk about me.”\nRotem’s brother Elad wrote online that “there is one thing you left behind you, our little brother. Do you remember how much you wanted the three of us to fly to Japan together? We’re planning to do it and to fulfill your ambition, but we never thought it would be without you.”\n“We’ll walk as if we’re walking behind you, we’ll only eat ramen as you demanded, and most importantly we’ll tell Naruto about you — we’ll tell him that you could have fled but you decided not to abandon your friends, we’ll tell him that there was no fear in your eyes, only bravery, and we’ll tell him that the smile on your face could never be wiped away.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Michael Ben Hamo, 21, a Golani squad commander from Rehovot, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion near Kibbutz Kissufim.\nWith news of the Hamas infiltration, he and his soldiers were sent to the front line to try and push back the terrorists and protect the kibbutz and the IDF outpost of Kissufim. There they fought against multiple cells of terrorists while under heavy gunfire, allowing other IDF troops to prepare for attack and join the fight to save the kibbutz. Both Michael and Staff Sgt. Adi Tzur were killed in the battle.\nHe was killed two days before he was slated to complete his mandatory IDF service. A few months later, his close friend, Cpt. Eyal Twito, was slain fighting in Gaza.\nMichael was buried on October 11 in Rehovot, just over a week before his 22nd birthday. He is survived by his parents, Yael and Meir, and his siblings Ohad, Noa and Asaf.\nRaised in a religious home in Rehovot, Michael attended a pre-army academy and then worked in agriculture for six months before enlisting in Golani.\nHis close friend, Moshe Hartman, wrote a song dedicated to Michael, called “Igulim Shel Layla” (Circles of the Night), and told Channel 12 news that his late friend was “one of the most beloved people I knew, at every stage and station of his life, people always would fall under his spell, he had this smile, something in his eyes, that you would look at and just fall in love.”\nHis girlfriend, Tamar Goldbart, wrote online that “even in your lifetime you were an angel and a hero, you didn’t need to die for us to know that.”\n“Thank you for loving with all of your heart, thank you for leaving me with so many sweet memories,” she added. “Thank you for all the emotional wisdom and humility that I took from you throughout our relationship… you are in the sunrises and the sunsets and everything in between. I’ll love you forever.”\nMichael’s sister, Noa, wrote on Facebook ahead of Memorial Day that she knows, “and everyone who knew you knows, that you would never have acted any differently — charging ahead, engaging the enemy, and the heroic battle you led was just a closing chord to who you were in life.”\n“A true warrior, a professional, an idealist, the most moral, who chose to be like this, who always devoted himself to the values he believed in,” wrote Noa. “A young man who loved this country and this people with all of his soul. Who loved to live, who loved to laugh, who wanted to do good.”\nAfter he was killed, his family found a diary he had written in before his death, including a passage that read: “My forefathers dreamed of the moment they would protect the State of Israel, and I am about to have that privilege. I hope that the day will come and I will prove that I would do everything for this country, above and beyond giving everything and risking it all for my comrades.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Bechor Chai Swid, 32, from Shlomit, was killed on October 7 while battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nThe family was spending the holiday in Shuva that morning, but when Bechor heard of the Hamas infiltration in the neighboring town of Pri Gan, next to Shlomit, he left and headed to help his friends in battle. On the way, he encountered a terrorist cell and opened fire on them, but was killed in the gun battle.\nAs a member of Shlomit’s local security team, he was posthumously recognized as a fallen soldier with the rank of master sergeant in the reserves.\nHe was buried on Jerusalem’s Mount Herzl on October 11. He is survived by his wife, Neora, their three daughters Carmi, Alma and Shaked, his parents, Hadassah and Yaakov and his siblings Naor, Lidor and Or.\nBorn and raised in Netivot, he moved as a teen to the nearby Moshav Shuva. After high school, he attended the Neve Dekalim hesder yeshiva in Ashdod before enlisting in the Givati Brigade, where he served as a squad commander, according to an online eulogy.\nBechor worked as a teacher for seven years before deciding to take a different path, opening his own gardening business and was pursuing a degree in architecture and interior design engineering at the Technological College Beersheba when he was killed. Zohar Nir, one of his instructors, was on hand to award his diploma posthumously to Bechor’s mother in March 2024.\n“In reality, Bechor taught us,” said Nir. “He sat in the front row and sharpened us. Bechor was full of knowledge, he knew what he was saying. He was the dad of everyone, the class was so much more wonderful because of his leadership.” He was known around school and among his friends as a “cowboy” for the trademark hat he always used to wear.\nBechor and his wife Neora met at the sheva brachot wedding celebration of mutual friends. They wed and settled first in Ashdod before moving to Shlomit, where Bechor built their home himself, which he was just finishing up when he was killed.\nNeora wrote in August 2024, marking 11 months since he was killed — “11 months without your hug, without your words, without your voice. Without your ‘good morning’ and your ‘good night.'”\n“Without hearing the click of your keys in the door, without your popping into the house in the middle of the day, without taking the girls to mincha and maariv [prayers], without the flowers you bought or the roses you clipped from the garden every Friday, without your laughter with the girls, without you throwing them up in the air and making us smoothies.”\nIt has been 11 months, she wrote, “without anyone to kill the cockroaches for me, and to remove the bird that got stuck in the chimney… without you building me something beautiful out of wood or going along with my crazy design ideas… without the Friday tractor rides in Re’im, without experiencing nature together as we used to do.”\nEleven months have passed, Neora added, “without you seeing Alma start first grade and Shakedi begin daycare, without being here with me in the hardest time of my life, without your huge heart, which was always there for others no matter what.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 304 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Dror Kaplun, 68, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7.\nHis wife, Marcelle Frailich Kaplun, was also murdered in the kibbutz that day. Dror was originally thought to have been taken captive, as his remains were not initially found, and his phone was traced to Gaza.\nIn the hours after the attack, Kaplun’s children saw a Hamas video showing Marcelle and Dror in their pajamas, seemingly unhurt, with bare feet and hands bound, being shoved along a Be’eri street by terrorists. But the following day another video surfaced, showing the two lying on a sidewalk with several others, not moving.\nIn December, the kibbutz announced that archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority succeeded in matching his DNA to bones uncovered by the fence of Kibbutz Be’eri.\nDror was buried on December 10 in Kibbutz Mishmarot. He is survived by his three children, Maayan, Noam and Moran, five grandchildren, Yuval, Ofir, Nir, Alon and Klil, and his brother Yehuda.\nThe son of Holocaust survivors, Dror was born in Kibbutz Ruhama, where he and his brother grew up in the era of communal child quarters, collecting stamps, playing chess and competing in volleyball.\nDror served in the Paratrooper’s Brigade during his military service and later became a platoon commander in Golani. After his service, he earned a bachelor’s degree in economics at the Ruppin Academic College and worked in Ruhama in the orchard and later in its toothbrush factory.\nHe went on to help the kibbutz transform from a collective to a privatized settlement, a process he continued as a communal manager at several other kibbutzes in the area undergoing the same transformation, according to a Be’eri eulogy.\nIn 1980 he wed Rosemary, a British volunteer whom he met on the kibbutz, and they had three children before divorcing in 2003. He was introduced to Marcelle not long after by Ayelet Goddard, who was also murdered on October 7, and the new couple settled in Be’eri.\nDror managed to enjoy a year of retirement before he was killed, devoting his time to reading books, working out, cooking healthy meals and spending time with his beloved grandchildren.\nMarcelle’s daughter, Mor Strikovski wrote on Facebook that Dror was “such a unique man, so kind, so generous, truthful and honest from all his heart and soul.”\nShe noted that while he “came to us in the middle of our lives, it seemed and felt like you had always been there. We were privileged to have you, you became like a father and a grandfather and it was so not taken for granted.”\nMor said Dror was always a source of “good advice and endless attention. With your kindness, the calm that so characterized you, you were my mother’s entire world, a gift, you fit like a glove and you were so happy together… at least you and Mom are together.”\nHis daughter Noam wrote to “thank you for life; as you would say, it’s the biggest gift there is. I’ll always remember the French toast you’d make us Saturday morning, the hiking trips around the kibbutz. When I bring up all these memories, I feel a deep sadness because of the sense of loss and missing out for me and for your grandchildren.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Yaad Ben Yaakov, 20, a Golani Brigade soldier from Petah Tikva, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nYaad was based at the Nahal Oz IDF outpost next to the border, and with the start of the rocket fire, he was ordered to head toward the border in an armored personnel carrier to repel the invading terrorists, according to an IDF eulogy. The APC was hit by an anti-tank missile, however the soldiers continued to fight and killed many terrorists. The effort failed in pushing back the terrorists entirely.\nAfter more than an hour of battle, the APC returned to the Nahal Oz outpost, and the soldiers exited to engage in a gun battle with a group of terrorists at the entrance to the base. Yaad and several of his comrades were shot dead there in the gunfight. His family found out about his death in a video circulating on social media showing his body lying on the ground outside the base.\nYaad was buried on October 12 in Petah Tikva. He is survived by his parents, Lihi and Yuval, and his older siblings Dor, Aviv, Stav and Idit.\nRaised mostly in Petah Tikva, he excelled in his studies and was known among his friends for his beaming smile. He started learning to play the guitar a few months before he was killed, and wanted to pursue a musical path, his mother said. He was a devoted soccer fan, obsessed with Real Madrid but also cheering on Maccabi Petah Tikva, especially after his close friend, Hadar Fuchs, joined the team as a player.\nHadar told a local sports site, “Yaad was the person with the most beautiful smile I knew. He simply brought his joy with him and instilled it in others. If I’d see him when I was feeling down or a little sad, within 30 seconds he’d pull me out of a funk and make me smile. He was just a happy kid who helped anyone who asked. He was there for all of his friends and that’s something special just to him. He had an incredible heart.”\nBetween Yaad’s time in the army and Hadar’s soccer career, they didn’t see each other that often, said Hadar, although Yaad was slated to soon complete his mandatory service. Yaad “always wanted to be a combat soldier, to be in Golani and to protect the State of Israel. All our friends supported him and told him to go for it and that we were relying on him. He protected the State of Israel until October 7 and there sadly he completed his job.”\nHis mother, Lihi, told the Kan public broadcaster that “my Yaad was warm, very intelligent, excellent, kind, very social — he had many friends and everyone loved him. He was simply an angel, an angel in life and an angel in death.”\nHer youngest, she said, she raised him largely as a single parent, “and on the one hand he was very caring and he would help me financially even when he was a soldier, but on the other hand he would lie on the couch and watch TV and say, ‘Mom I want to cuddle.’ He would rest on me and embrace me — he was just a wonderful, wonderful kid.”\nIn April, Lihi told a local news site that she was “happy that he was a combat soldier and I was so proud when he enlisted in Golani. Yaad was a good soldier, who did everything he was supposed to.”\nContemplating the family’s first Passover without him, she said, was unfathomable, as normally on Seder night he “was funny, would tell jokes, he’d also tease, but with a smile and a hug and a kiss… We’ll miss him so much.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Dvir Haim Rossler, 21, a Golani soldier from the West Bank settlement of Kedumim, was killed on October 7 battling a Hamas invasion of an IDF outpost next to the Gaza border.\nWhen the air raid sirens began to ring on the base that Saturday morning, Dvir and two of his comrades ran for the bomb shelter as they’d always been instructed. They quickly realized that Hamas terrorists had also invaded the base, and were trying to enter the room.\nDvir held the door closed, and the terrorists attached explosives on the other side to blow it up. Dvir was killed in the explosion, but the two other soldiers with him survived.\nHe was buried on October 12 in Kedumim. He is survived by his parents, Ravit and Amichai, and his younger siblings Dotan, Gili and Ori.\nDvir attended local schools growing up, and then a yeshiva in Ra’anana for high school before enrolling in a pre-military academy, according to an online eulogy. He loved sports and trained in the capoeira martial art. He played the drums and liked fixing up old cars and motorcycles, and had a wide circle of friends from many stages of life, his loved ones said. His number one goal, they said, was to enlist in Golani, and he was filled with pride when he did.\nStaff Sgt. Tzvi Cohen, Dvir’s comrade who was with him that day and survived the explosion, told Maariv that they met during training in December 2021, “and it was very easy to connect with him, and he’d immediately connect you with others and you know that if you’re close to him you won’t feel the difficulty and the strains of the training and exercises. He just spread joy.”\nThe pair stayed together in the army after training, Tzvi said, “and we became close friends… I saw so many times his generosity and his love not just to people but also to places we spent time in. Everyone knew that he was very special and you could always rely on him.”\nHis mother, Ravit, wrote a tribute in the Makor Rishon newspaper to “my Dviri, my firstborn, my pure and kind-hearted beloved, the brave and the heroic.”\n“Wherever you went, your good qualities stood out,” she wrote. “At every school parent’s evening, we left proud from all the praise they had. You were so special, modest and humble with strength and charisma unique just to you, and of course they always said how handsome you were — beautiful on the outside but mostly on the inside.”\nThey were always told, she said, “how gentle and polite you were, always respectful and promoting peace. You knew how to be serious when needed but also incredibly funny. You loved to do impressions of us and to make the whole family laugh — all with a million-dollar smile.”\nHis father, Amichai, told Maariv that from 1st grade through 12th grade “people always told me that Dvir Haim was the connecting thread between everyone, the one who spread light to everyone.”\n“Everyone knew that he could unite everyone, that was what characterized him,” he added. “He made everyone feel unique and special, everyone thought they were the most beloved friend in the life of Dvir Haim, but he gave that feeling to everyone.”\nAmichai said he feels a sense of mission to share the feeling of joy and unity that Dvir did in his life: “I feel the need to continue spreading the joy for life that he gave to everyone, to strengthen all the people of Israel — that’s what he did in life and that’s what he’s doing now above.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 307 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Supt. Emin Akhundov, 36, a squad commander in the Israel Police’s Yoav Unit, was killed on October 7 fighting the Hamas invasion of the Supernova music festival.\nEmin was on duty as a police officer at the festival when the Hamas onslaught began. He told his wife via phone that they were trying to evacuate the large number of revelers after the party was shut down due to rocket fire. An hour later, around 7:30 a.m., he wrote to her that there was a terrorist invasion of southern Israel, and she should hunker down inside their home. After 8 a.m., his wife didn’t hear from him.\nFellow police officer Supt. Sergey Dyachuk told Ynet that as he was realizing the scale of the attack, he met up with Emin, and the pair decided that Sergey and other officers would head toward the highway while Emin and a group would go toward the forest. Both were met with enormous volleys of gunfire, he said, and before long, after Emin no longer answered, Sergey understood that he had been killed.\nEmin was buried in Beersheba on October 8. He is survived by his wife, Luba, their children Daniel, 7, and Romi, 5, his parents, Galina and Ragim and his sister Sabina.\nBorn in Azerbaijan, he moved to Israel as a teenager as part of the Na’aleh young immigration program, settling in a dormitory in Kibbutz Shefayim, according to an Ofakim municipal eulogy.\nAfter finishing high school, he enlisted as a lone soldier and served as a combat soldier in the Israeli Air Force and took part in fighting in the Second Lebanon War. Emin signed on to stay in the IDF past his mandatory service, eventually serving 10 years in the military, according to a eulogy from the Ashkelon Academic College, where he later received a bachelor’s degree in criminology.\nAfter completing his time in the army, Emin joined the Israel Police in 2015, once again working his way up from the bottom and completing an officer’s course before taking on the role of squad commander in the Yoav Unit. At the same time, he also completed an MBA at Ben Gurion University and was slated to start another master’s degree at the university in emergency preparedness in October 2023.\nHe met his wife, Luba, when they were both high school students taking part in the Na’aleh program for immigrants without their parents. The couple settled in Beersheba, had two children, and moved in 2022 to Ofakim.\nHis comrades described him as a fair and supportive commander, devoted to his job who spent all of his free time with his family. He loved extreme sports and cars, his loved ones said, particularly bike riding and running.\nLuba told Ynet that the period since his death “has been a roller coaster and a huge shock. I’m trying to be strong for the kids, to focus on the good and to preserve his memory — after all he wasn’t just killed, he was killed while protecting innocent people.”\nShe said she always knew there was some danger in his job, “but we never thought it would happen at an innocent festival… [Emin] wanted a job in the field, he didn’t want to sit in an office. We were in a good place, the kids were growing up a little and the house was blossoming. We took a spontaneous vacation together in Berlin.”\nShe said Emin was asked to work at the festival “because there weren’t any senior officers there for security. He didn’t want to go, but Emin was a responsible person — honest and decent — and he felt a responsibility to go.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Mordechai “Modi” Amir, 67, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in his home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7.\nWhen he realized that terrorists had invaded the kibbutz, he instructed his two daughters and granddaughter to hide in the shower that he had built in their reinforced room. He decided to stay in the main section of the room, knowing he was unable to lock the door, and hoping that the terrorists would believe he was there alone.\nWhen the terrorists entered the home, they killed Modi in his safe room, his body blocking the bathroom entrance, saving the lives of the rest of his family. His daughters and granddaughter were rescued and evacuated from the kibbutz almost 24 hours later.\nModi was buried on October 18 in Tel Aviv. He is survived by his wife, Batya, their children Alon, Anat, Limor and Zohar, several grandchildren and two sisters.\nHis son-in-law, Yony Kozo, told Makor Rishon that Modi’s actions on October 7 “were a deliberate decision, for what was best. It cost him his life, and this is how he saved his daughters and granddaughter. Modi was a computer guy in hi-tech companies, an amateur electrician, plumber and carpenter, a man who was quick thinking and who always knew how to find the most practical solution. And that’s what he did in those moments.”\nAn online eulogy noted that Modi was born in Givatayim and moved to Kfar Aza with a youth settlement group at age 18. He got a degree in biology at Ben Gurion University, where he met his wife, Batya. The couple settled in Kfar Aza where they raised their family. At first he worked as an electrician in the kibbutz, later moving into the world of computers, and eventually going to work for IBM for 20 years, the eulogy said. In 2015 he started working for a startup called Resonai, where he remained until he was killed.\nHis daughter, Anat, wrote online that her father “loved to laugh, and was very funny. He wouldn’t tell jokes, but he would tell his stories and his struggles. He had a natural talent for it and a charisma that made him and his stories the center of every conversation.”\nAnat said that her father “believed in work, and he did everything himself. Both because he was hardworking and enjoyed it, and also because he didn’t trust other professionals — who didn’t meet his high standards,” and he built most of the family home himself. “He was very smart, which was another reason he did everything himself — he had no problems researching, reading and learning what was necessary.”\nAnat asked the artist Zeev (Shoshke) Engelmayer to design a plaque for his grave, which read: “Here lies Modi, the love of our lives, a man of work, smart and resourceful, a lover of people who laughed and made us laugh.”\n“Modi was an optimist, loved to tell stories, and also loved ice cream. He was the national champion of incredible hugs, and he loved his children most of all.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

She died on the spot.”\nHer body was discovered two days later and she was buried in Kibbutz Shefayim on October 22. She is survived by her four children — Anat, Yoni, Dror and Lilach — several grandchildren and her siblings, Tammy, Aharon and Hannah. She was predeceased by her husband, who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and for whom she had cared for five and a half years before his death.\nNaomi grew up in Kibbutz Kfar Blum in the north, and settled in Kfar Aza, adjacent to Gaza, in the 1960s. She was a nurse throughout her professional life — first working for the kibbutz, and then with preemies at Beersheba’s Soroka Medical Center until her retirement.\nAccording to an official government eulogy, her family wrote of the void left by her murder and the comfort they took in the fact that on the morning of October 7, she managed to speak one last time on the phone with some of her children and grandchildren.\nShe “joked around with them. Naomi was a loving, cheerful, smiling, optimistic, sensitive and sentimental woman who lived her life with a sense of simplicity, giving, compassion and empathy towards others.”\nNaomi was also the main source of inspiration for new lyrics written by her extended family for Leonard Cohen’s “Who By Fire,” following the Hamas-led atrocities of October 7.\nHer family members — her cousin Vered Raz, and Raz’s husband and daughter, Tzachi Gatzek and Gali Gatzek — put together this new version. “It’s the personal and the national,” said his wife, Raz.\nHer nephew, Or Alterman, reminisced about his time with his aunt in the kibbutz during the Gulf War, when Kfar Aza was “the safest place in the country. My beloved uncle and aunt took care of me until things quieted down.”\nHe went on to say that “on one of my last visits to Kfar Aza, Naomi took me for a ride on her scooter along the trails of the kibbutz.

Hanan was killed four days before his 42nd birthday, and Lior was killed a day after his 43rd birthday.\nHanan’s family found no trace of him in the bullet-ridden car in which he fled the rave, including any blood splatter. His keys, phone and identification document were inside, and pieced together video footage showed him fleeing the rave, but nothing further.\nIt wasn’t until January 2024 that the IDF officially declared that Hanan was one of the hostages being held in Gaza. His fate was not known until his body was recovered months later.\nHanan was buried on May 26, 2024, in Tel Aviv. He is survived by his two children, Emily, 12, and Yarin, 9, as well as his parents, Reuven and Vered, and his sisters, Orit and Avivit.\n“Hanan was a devoted and loving father, a family man and friend. He was a sports enthusiast and an avid fan of Hapoel Tel Aviv. Hanan was taken hostage while doing what he loved most — enjoying music, dancing, and celebrating life,” the Hostage Families Forum said.\n“I feared this ending but I wanted so much for it to end differently,” Avivit told AFP at the funeral. “We thought they were coming back alive, but they’re coming back in coffins.”\nAt his funeral, his 11-year-old nephew, Amor, noted that “for eight months, I have been fighting for you, for eight months the longing hasn’t stopped, for eight months I haven’t stopped mentioning the name Hanan Yablonka,” according to Ynet.\n“Even when you weren’t here, you made my dream of flying to New York come true and gave me the honor of speaking about you in front of important people. Because of you, I met many people who are now an important part of my life. Thank you for being part of my life, I’m really sorry I didn’t get to say goodbye. I’m sorry you won’t be able to come to my bar mitzvah,” he said.\nEulogizing her son, Vered Yablonka thanked the thousands who joined a solidarity march to the cemetery, and described Hanan as someone who was “impossible not to love.”\n“And I ask, how can I bid you farewell? In our worst dreams, we couldn’t imagine something like this. What I would give to hug you, to kiss you, breathe you,” she said, vowing that her grandchildren will “grow up to be happy and joyful despite the difficult farewell.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Sgt. First Class Ohad Cohen, 20, a soldier in the Israeli Air Force’s elite Shaldag unit, from Idan, was killed battling Hamas terrorists on October 7 in Kibbutz Be’eri.\nThe morning of the attack, Ohad was on duty with the members of his unit when the assault began, and they were the first military forces to be sent to Be’eri, where hundreds of Hamas terrorists had invaded. They arrived via helicopter around 9 a.m.\nThe 13 Shaldag fighters entered the kibbutz, and Ohad was the first soldier killed there that day, leading the small number of troops to decide to withdraw to the entrance of the kibbutz and evacuate the wounded. Further military reinforcements did not arrive for several hours.\nOhad was buried in Idan on October 10. He is survived by his parents, Michal and Moshe, his sisters Nitzan, Ron and Clil and his girlfriend Ofir, as well as three grandparents. His uncle, Staff Sgt. Shahar Cohen, was also killed at age 20, almost exactly 32 years earlier, while fighting in south Lebanon.\nAccording to a Shaldag eulogy, Ohad enlisted in the IDF in late 2021, after a year in a pre-military academy in Kibbutz Sufa. He completed the elite unit’s tough training — the longest of any IDF unit — just a few months before he was killed. During his training, he was bitten by a snake and hospitalized in serious condition but recovered to return to his unit.\nOhad loved to read and write and engage in sports and exercise, particularly running, as well as traveling and hiking around the country. He was active in a local youth group in the small town in the desert along the border with Jordan where he grew up, first as a member and later as a counselor.\nA eulogy on the Central Arava Regional Council website described him as “a smart boy, highly moral, social and smiley. Almost all of his friends remember first and foremost his kind smile that best characterized him, his sensitivity and the light he spread around him.”\nHis younger sister, Clil, wrote on Instagram that she didn’t want to eulogize her beloved brother, “because I don’t want to say goodbye, I want you to show up at the door on Friday afternoon after a tough week and bring mom flowers and ask me, ‘How was your week?'”\n“I want you to get mad at me for not cleaning up the house, and because there are ‘girl things’ in the shower,” she continued. “I want you to come with Ofir for Shabbat and sit at Friday night dinner and we’ll all laugh together like everything is normal. I want you to throw Or in the air and make him laugh and we’ll all watch from the side. I just want you here.”\nIn her eulogy, his mother, Michal, wrote that Ohad was “a child full of love, full of goodness. Wherever you went, you made everyone fall in love with you — and how could they not?”\n“You always ran to help, you were always happy, you did everything with ease and with love,” she added. “There was a time when Dad and I couldn’t go anywhere in the Arava without someone approaching us and saying, ‘You’re Ohad’s parents? You have the most wonderful child in the world.’ And when they left we’d whisper, ‘Who was that?'”\nIn the army, she said, “You blossomed and you grew, you became a man. Wonderful and unique… after all, if Ohad had been in charge of how this event would go, we’d probably all be here in clown hats with a beer in our hands.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Adi Dagan, 68, of Kibbutz Be’eri, was slain in the Hamas invasion of the kibbutz on October 7.\nAdi and his wife Hadas hid in their safe room with the start of the onslaught, and were joined not long after by Yasmin Porat and Tal Katz, strangers who had fled the Supernova festival and had hoped to find safety in nearby Be’eri.\nBut Adi, Hadas, Tal and Yasmin were later pulled from the Dagan home by Hamas terrorists and forced to hole up with a number of other hostages inside the home of Pessi Cohen during the onslaught. As IDF troops closed in, the terrorists positioned themselves behind the hostages, using them as human shields and as bargaining chips to secure their safe passage back to Gaza.\nIn a highly contentious and investigated incident, IDF forces fired a light tank shell at the pathway leading to the house, which bounced off the ground and struck just above the doorway; shrapnel from the impact killed Adi and injured Hadas. Two hours later, special forces entered the home, engaging in a gun battle with the remaining terrorists; Hadas was the only one to emerge alive. Yasmin had been saved earlier as a Hamas terrorist used her as a human shield to surrender to the troops.\nAdi was buried on October 25, 2023, in Kibbutz Revivim, and on September 8, 2024, he was reburied in Be’eri. He is survived by his wife, Hadas, their four children, Guy, Noa, Zohar and Sa’ar, and 11 grandchildren, as well as his sister, Anat. His older brother, Oshri, died of cancer when he was 11.\nAccording to a kibbutz eulogy, Adi was born and raised in Be’eri, to parents who were among its founders. He served his mandatory military service in the elite Shayetet 13 naval unit, and during his reserve duty he took part in Operation Moses to evacuate Ethiopian Jewry from Sudan.\nHe and Hadas both grew up in Be’eri, but met when they both took part in a trip to Sinai, and later wed in 1980. Adi studied economics at Ben Gurion University and worked in a number of different jobs running the kibbutz finances until he retired.\nIn his post-work life, the kibbutz eulogy reads, he took up many activities he never had time for before — a new love of mixing cocktails as an amateur bartender, and regular volunteer work driving sick Gazan children from the border to Israeli hospitals for treatment.\nHis daughter, Zohar, wrote on Facebook that it was strange to initially bury him far from “the ground where I grew up and was raised to love this land… Dad, it’s not fair that after everything you went through, you gave, you contributed, fought for, protected, you were buried far from the land you loved so much, from the home you nurtured, from your strawberries and figs, from the pathways of your morning walks.”\nAt his second funeral in Be’eri in September 2024, his cousin, Dani Rabinovich, said Adi was “always surrounded by love, he charmed everyone naturally.”\n“He didn’t try to find grace — grace found him, sat comfortably on him like a skyline resting on the horizon,” added Dani. “He never tried to be liked, never pretended to be nice… yet he was like a lighthouse spreading a smile through benevolent eyes.”\nDani said they were close as children, and “even when we grew up Adi was a constant source of stability, balance, direction… his life was a series of significant deeds and big achievements, yet his modesty all these years remained true and incorruptible.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 313 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

Omri Peretz, 20, a squad commander in the Bislamach Brigade’s 450th Battalion, from Elyakhin, was killed on October 7 while battling terrorists invading Kibbutz Kissufim.\nHe was buried on October 15 in Elyakhin. He is survived by his parents, Orit and Ofer, and his two sisters, Amit and Adi.\nThe youngest child, he attended the Rabin pre-military academy and completed the Israel Defense Forces squad commanders’ course with honors.\nPeretz previously served with the Paratroopers Brigade, and when the war broke out, he was serving with the Bislamach Brigade — the IDF’s School for Infantry Corps Professions and Squad Commanders in peacetime.\nOmri was part of the first army force to arrive at the towns enveloping Gaza. After advancing toward Kibbutz Kissufim, the force fought at close range some 50 terrorists attempting to invade the kibbutz. Omri was killed along with his three soldiers, Staff Sgt. Regev Amar, Sgt. Matan Malka and Sgt. Bar Yankilov.\nHis parents told the Kan public broadcaster that after learning of his death, they slept in his room for three months: “You try to hang on to what is left. His bed, his smell,” said his mother Orit.\nOmri’s parents were on vacation in Greece when the October 7 onslaught began, and his father told Ynet that he called his son, “and he told me he didn’t have much time, that they were being called up to the battle in the south. I asked him to stay safe.” When they arrived back at the airport in Israel, they got the news that he had been killed.\nOmri’s sister, Amit, told Kan that she had last seen her brother two weeks before October 7, at her wedding. “I’m so sorry I woke up late on Saturday, because maybe if I had woken up early enough, I would have been able to talk to him.”\nHis father Ofer said over his grave: “Our Omriki, King Omriki. It is difficult to speak about you in the past tense, to imagine that we will no longer see your big smile at the door, as you throw your bag on the floor and say ‘I’m hungry, fix me some food.’”\nHe said he was so worried when he learned that Omri was heading to the front lines, “because I know you, my Omriki, you’re always the first to take charge. Our Omriki, you are an enlightened and enlightening child with an eternal smile, surrounded by friends and loved ones. How could you not be? Handsome inside and out. Mom and I have been blessed with an angel for a child.”\nA representative of the IDF read a eulogy on behalf of Omri’s commander, who was unable to attend his funeral. He wrote, “I had the privilege of guiding you as you took your first steps as commander. You wanted the best for your soldiers, both in service and in battle. You were killed shoulder to shoulder with your comrades. An equal among equals yet leading them courageously.”\nHe added, “I truly love you. Everyone who knew you was privileged. Protect your parents, watch over them from above. The void you left will never be filled and thank you for the privilege of knowing you.”\nIn the IDF squad commanders’ course notebook, Kan reported, Omri had written: “People have fallen on this land for us to be able to live here peacefully, and now it is our turn to contribute all we can.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Moments later, a pick-up truck of terrorists drove by and shot dead all 13 travelers.

Tatiana was known around the city for her love of plants, she grew fruits, rare succulents and decorative plants.

All three were shot dead as they tried to leave the site of the festival and were killed by terrorists lying in wait along the road.\nHis body was not immediately located, and his friends went out to look for him and found his remains hidden in the brush next to the road, where he had tried to hide after being fatally wounded.\nDado was buried in Ashkelon on October 15.

    "story": "Asaf “Asi” Schlezinger, 57, from Rosh Ha’ayin, was murdered at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nAsaf attended the rave not as a partygoer, but as a paramedic and the head of the festival’s medical response team. When the rocket fire began that morning, Asaf texted his wife that they were shutting things down and he would call when he was on his way home. Around 9 a.m., he called her and said “don’t worry, I’m fine, I can’t talk I’m treating the wounded.”\nThat was the last she heard from him. Asaf stayed at the festival site caring for the wounded and evacuating the injured until he himself was shot dead by the terrorists.\nAsaf was buried on October 10 in Rosh Ha’ayin. He is survived by his wife, Galit, their children Nir and Nitzan, his mother, Malka, and his sisters Orna, Shirly and Tehiya. He was predeceased by his father, David, a Holocaust survivor, and his sister Nava.\nHe grew up in in Petah Tikva, and began volunteering in the Magen David Adom ambulance service as a teenager. During his mandatory IDF service, he served in the Golani Brigade as a combat medic. After his release, he continued along the same path, training and working as a paramedic, according to a state eulogy.\nAsaf and Galit met when he accompanied a patient in an ambulance to the hospital, where Galit was working. They married in 1989 and had their twins in 1995. Family and friends said he loved to cook, and to travel the land of Israel and study its history, and also had a deep love of music.\nNir shared online the eulogy he wrote for his father: “Dad, you were always my hero.”\n“Stable, strong, dedicated, sharp, with unreal strengths,” he wrote. “If anyone would ask me who is the strongest person I know, I would immediately respond: my father.” The family was not surprised, he said, that he didn’t try to flee the festival, and stayed “to help and to treat anyone you could with your hands of gold. I’m certain that you were a huge light in that horrible darkness there.”\n“You were a cantankerous person, and I always loved that in you,” Nir added. “You were a strong person, sometimes bordering on closed off, who always went with his truth. You didn’t care what people thought of you… you always believed in your path, and you pursued it until the end.”\nNitzan told Fox News that he was “a great father, a great friend, everyone loved him, he was very kind, always loved to help other people — he was saving lives for many years.”\nHis wife, Galit wrote on Facebook to “my love, my other half, my best friend.”\n“We went through so many things together, including difficulties and challenges. But nothing prepared me for this most difficult moment… My heart is broken and bleeding and my mind can’t stop racing with thoughts of what happened.”\nThe fact that he was saving lives until his last moment “is who you were and what you always did for years — after all we met 36 years ago when you brought a patient [to the hospital] and treated him in the ambulance.”\n“My love, I don’t know how to go on without you, but I have our two incredible children, Nir and Nitzan, the two wonderful flowers whom we raised together, and you were so proud of them, and had so much to be proud of.

Col. Alim Abdallah and Master Sgt. (res.) Gilad Molcho, all of the 300th “Baram” Regional Brigade, when several Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists infiltrated into Israeli territory from Lebanon. The clash occurred near the northern Bedouin Israeli town of Arab al-Aramshe and the Lebanese village of Dhayra.\nJawad was buried in Hurfeish on October 10. He is survived by his parents, Rashida and Akram and his older siblings Jodd, Nabih and Nawal.\nHis father, Akram, told Israel Hayom that Jawad “was an excellent student who loved programming and math and from childhood loved exploring nature.” Akram said his son loved the State of Israel, and most members of their Druze family had done extended military services, just like Jawad, “who felt a sense of mission, he felt he could give of himself.”\nHis older brother Jodd said Jawad “was very sporty, we would work out together 4-5 times a week, he loved to exercise. He also had a lot of friends, every weekend he would go out hiking or to the beach. He was a guy full of life, and everyone who met him, loved him.”\nJawad’s family said he dreamed of one day traveling the world, and had just returned from a trip to San Francisco a week before he was killed — but still had a long list of destinations he wanted to one day visit.\nJodd told a local news site that “Jawad was a friend and also a brother who accompanied me all the time, we were together everywhere, also abroad and also in our workouts.” Jodd, who was serving in reserve duty when his brother was killed, said Jawad was about to finish up his army service at the time of the attack, and planned to study electrical engineering and pursue a career in hi-tech.\n“Despite his young age, Jawad leaves behind so many fond memories,” said Jodd. “He never argued with anyone, he helped so many people and trained lots of people at the gym, he helped youth get in shape and be accepted to elite units, Jawad was friends with everyone.”\nIn a Memorial Day video press conference, Jawad’s brother Nabih talked about his younger brother’s wide smile and laugh, and how he was “like a half twin.”\n“I never imagined that one day I wouldn’t see his smile again or hear his laugh again,” he said. “Losing him was hard and Memorial Day will be the hardest ever and the most powerful because my brother gave his life to protect everyone.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Master Sgt. (res.) Gal Meir Eisenkot, 25, of the 551st Brigade’s 699th Battalion, from Herzliya, was killed on December 7, 2023, while fighting in Gaza.\nGal, the son of former IDF chief and MK Gadi Eisenkot, was killed after a bomb exploded in a tunnel shaft near soldiers in the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza. He was rushed in critical condition to a hospital in Israel, where he succumbed to his injuries.\nIt was later revealed that he and Master Sgt. (res.) Eyal Meir Berkowitz were killed as part of an ultimately successful operation to recover the bodies of hostages Eden Zecharya and Warrant Officer Ziv Dado.\nGal was buried on December 8, 2023, in Herzliya. He is survived by his parents, Gadi and Chana, and his siblings Guy, Rotem, Yael and Roz.\nGal was a student at Tel Aviv University pursuing a bachelor’s degree in computer science with a specialty in bioinformatics. He was called up to reserve duty on October 7 with the start of the war and later entered Gaza as part of the ground operation. A day after he was killed, his first cousin, Sgt. Maor Cohen Eisenkot, 19, was also slain while fighting in Gaza.\nGal’s friend Lee Yaron wrote on Facebook that Gal “was a man of truth and justice, straight as an arrow. A man of compassion and modesty and humility, Galgul you were so shy, you didn’t know how smart and beautiful you were.”\nGal, she added, “was a man of excellence and endless diligence, a man of caring and mercy, a man whose mouth and his heart always matched, whose every word was a commitment.”\n“I want you to walk in the door with your normal huge hug… you always made my mother laugh, gave my father respect, with your heart-expanding eyes, your honest bashful smile, which has made me happy as long as I can remember. I loved you and I loved being near you from the moment you entered our lives.”\nAt his funeral, his father, Gadi, recalled a conversation with his son several years ago during which Gal said that he had missed his father throughout his childhood when the elder Eisenkot wasn’t around much due to his role in the IDF. “I told you mom was there for you throughout all of those years, and that I was very proud of the close relationships you had built with your mother and siblings,” Eisenkot said.\n“When you grew up, I marveled at your immense seriousness and your sense of humor… For you, excellence was a way of life,” said Eisenkot. “Gal, I promise that we will continue the campaign [in Gaza], fighting to strengthen the state you so loved, and especially so that it will be strong, developed and just.”\nHe noted, “You would always criticize things that you disliked about what was happening here.” Voice breaking, he continued, “Galush, love of our heart, I promise you that we will continue to be a unified and happy family, so that the great sacrifice by you and the other fallen will not be in vain, and we will be deserving of it.”\nWrapping up his speech, Eisenkot said: “I salute you, my beloved son. We love you forever — your father, mother and the whole family.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 319 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

When a grenade was thrown at the group, Shlomi threw it back toward the terrorist and was subsequently killed by other gunmen.\nHe was buried on October 15 in Kibbutz Gevim and is survived by his wife Ofra and their four children, as well as his parents, Binyamina and Gad, and his siblings Eli, Dudi and Shira.\nAfter a long military career, Shlomi worked as a purchasing manager for the Meptagon Group.\nEnergy and Infrastructure Minister Eli Cohen, who met Shlomi when they took part in an officers’ course in the IDF 30 years ago, mourned his “beloved friend.”\n“Shlomi established with Ofra a magnificent family, which he loved so very much. He really loved the country and the land, and enjoyed jogging, horse riding, driving his jeep and biking,” Cohen wrote. “Saturday morning, a week ago, he had gone on a bike ride from which he never returned, and even in his last moments he acted to help others and save lives.”\nShlomi’s son, Be’eri, 11, started a new school for evacuees a few days after completing the shiva seven-day mourning period for his father. He told Ynet that it was important for him to have a mezuzah afix to each doorway at the school, due to his father’s traditional values.\nHis mother said, “He was very close to Shlomi and it is important for him to be close to his late father’s identity.”\nShlomi’s niece, Or Mozes, eulogized him in Israel Hayom, writing, “I just can’t believe I am writing about you in the past tense. I still can’t comprehend. I don’t believe it. It feels like we’re inside one long ongoing nightmare.”\nShe added that she continues to believe “you will arrive any moment now, with your smile, and keep telling jokes and make us laugh as always. And, of course, with a tray full of steaks and, as always, try and persuade us to eat, because ‘it’s tasty, you’re missing out!’ (even though I’ve been vegetarian for many years).”\nHis uncle, Alon Eshkol, told of his grief on a memorial site and remembered how well-respected Shlomi had been in his IDF roles.\n“My heart ached until they found you, endless tears of sorrow over the loss. I was with you during your various roles in the IDF and experienced the admiration of your people and commanders and my heart swelled every time we met, you with a big smile on your face.”\nShlomi’s brother, Eli, wrote on Facebook a week after he was killed that “my little brother is no longer.”\n“My little brother wanted to enjoy a bike ride,” he added. “My little brother will no longer be part of the trio that lifts up our little sister for our traditional photo at family gatherings.

All four were shot dead in the vehicle as they approached the Mefalsim Junction.

He is survived by his four children, Yarden, Asaf, Omer and Ilay, and two grandchildren, Maya and Roni, as well as his parents, Roberto and Gila, and his brothers Motti and Itai.\nHe was born and raised in Ashdod, to parents who immigrated from Argentina and Turkey. Itzhak worked for the Y.B. Nir crane and construction company and was described by his loved ones as young at heart, involved in sports and loved to enjoy the good life.\nHis daughter, Yarden, described her father in a radio interview as a “smiling person, witty, with a sense of humor, the first dad to show up when called, a wonderful grandfather — as much as he was macho and strong and tough, with my daughters he was like butter. All his tenderness emerged. He was a wonderful person, a good friend, he totally loved life.”\nItzhak’s brother, Itai, told a local news outlet that his older brother “was a top-notch guy, and a role model to me and to everyone in the family.”\n“He set goals for himself throughout life and achieved everything he dreamed of,” his brother added. “He was a guy who didn’t rest for a moment… during the day he was a tough senior manager and in the afternoon he’d go out to exercise and at night he’d celebrate with a beer at the beach with people younger than him — because that’s how we felt.”\nItai said his brother joked that “sleep was for the weak. He always loved to walk on the edge, to live on the extreme… He was the type to set a goal and achieve it. If I ever had doubts in life or needed advice, Itzhak was always the one I went to.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Ido Yehoshua, 27, a squad commander in the Israeli Air Force’s elite Shaldag unit, from Ayelet Hashahar, was killed on October 7 while battling Hamas at the Re’im IDF base.\nThat Saturday morning was his wife’s birthday, and they awoke in their home in the central city of Yavne to sirens. Before he was even called in, Ido headed south to join the fight against Hamas and assess the situation.\nIdo and his soldiers were sent to the Re’im base, which houses the Gaza Division, to try and seize control back from the terrorist invaders, and to rescue the soldiers, commanders and a number of civilians who were holed up inside. He and his small group of soldiers entered the base and managed to kill a number of terrorists, while Ido was killed in the fierce firefight. Israel ultimately regained control of the base later that evening.\nIdo was buried in Ayelet HaShahar on October 12. He is survived by his wife, Ziv, and his son, Eitan Yehuda, who was born several months after he was killed, as well as his parents, Rakefet and Yehuda, his sister Dor and brother Omri.\nHis mother, Rakefet, told a local radio station that “Ido used to say that he would become the IDF chief of staff, but later he said that he would either become IDF chief or be killed. Sadly, he was killed.”\nShe said that her son “saw himself serving the country, he really loved the army and as his service continued he also built a path that started in Unit 669 and included an officer’s course and the Golani Brigade, he was on a track of commander positions to advance… He was brave and determined, he was excellent.”\nIdo’s wife, Ziv, said that a week before he was killed they had been on vacation together in the Seychelles discussing baby names. Ido wanted to call their firstborn Eitan, but Ziv didn’t. “Eventually he said that it didn’t really matter, because we’ll call the first one this and the second one something else,” she told Channel 12 news. “Of course I called him the name Ido wanted, and I added Yehuda for his father.”\nZiv said, “I promised myself before the baby arrived that he would grow up with joy, that I would be a happy mom for him and not just outwardly. I promised myself that I would raise him with his father’s values, and his father is a hero. I decided to do everything so that he would hear about him as much as possible, know his story, and be proud of him.”\nShe added that “it’s important people know that Ido wasn’t just a hero. She was also a man who loved life, who loved to enjoy and be happy, that his dream was to be a father. He chose to sacrifice all that so that we could all keep living here.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 322 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

Stuck in traffic trying to leave and unaware of what lay in wait, Sharon made a u-turn and headed for the Mefalsim Junction, but then stopped her car and ran toward a bus stop bomb shelter. She was shot dead in a volley of bullets, her family said after viewing video footage of her final moments.\nShe attended the rave with her friend Daniel Ben-Senior who was also murdered that day. Sharon’s body was only identified several days later.\nSharon was buried on October 12 in Ramat Hasharon.

She had three sons and later divorced, raising her children as a single mom and eventually moving in with her parents.\nHer family and friends said Sharon always loved to dance, from her youth until her very last day. She was a regular on the festival scene, embracing its ethos of free expression, celebration and letting loose.\nHer oldest son, Itay, told Ynet that “my mom was a very happy person, accepting and accommodating, with zero judgement. We had a very unique relationship, as mother and son but also as close friends. She really loved to do good in the world, to dance, music, parties. She would party not infrequently at festivals, events, nature parties.”\nItay said the single-parent family never had much money, “but she always gave all of us the sense that she was a warrior who fought so we’d never feel like we were lacking. She always had a smile from ear to ear and good energies.”\nHer son Noam told the Kan public broadcaster that he most misses “annoying” his mother. “I miss hearing her laugh, seeing her smile, I miss it in a way I can’t even describe.”\nHer sister, Hadas, said on Channel 13 that Sharon was “happy all of her life — with all the difficulties of raising three kids, a single mom, living with her parents, it wasn’t easy, but she never gave up on life.”\nThe tribe of people who attend such festivals, she said, “are people of love and freedom, life is hard, this was their moment.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

He is survived by his wife, Sigal, and their four children, Raz, 7, Yotam, 6, Ron, 4 and Dor, who was born on October 16, 2023, as well as his parents, Yehiel and Yael, brother Neta and sister Arbel.\nDolev — a civil engineer who worked in quality control — was described by his family and friends as a family man who loved standup comedy and comedy podcasts, and his wife said that his favorite Jewish holiday was Purim.\nFollowing news of his death, United Hatzalah founder and head Eli Beer recalled Dolev as someone who “always acted for the sake of others and provided aid and assistance to all, even people he did not know.”\nHis uncle, Udi Doron, told Ynet, “Dolev was an incredible kid. He was a medic with both MDA and United Hatzalah. He headed straight for every incident or call, and also on October 7 he set out to save lives and left his kids and pregnant wife in the reinforced room.”\nOn the 30-day anniversary of Dolev’s funeral, his wife, Sigal — who had been with Dolev since they met in the 6th grade — wrote that she couldn’t believe, “I’m standing here and you’re not by my side. Not here to hold my hand. Not here so that I can lean on you so that you can catch me so I don’t fall.”\n“I always felt that you and I were forever, like in fairy tales, that nothing could happen to us,” she added. “You live so much inside me, but you are so missed… You are my whole life, my whole world. A world that is cracked. A world that is broken.”\n“You can probably see that our friends are surrounding me all the time, making sure to embrace, to care for, to love, like every close family member,” Sigal wrote. “But there is a part that will never be filled, and it belongs to you.

    "story": "Warrant Officer Ziv Dado, 36, a logistics supervisor in the Golani Brigade’s 51st Battalion, from Rehovot, was killed battling Hamas on October 7 and his body kidnapped to Gaza.\nThe morning of the attack, Ziv set out from home to head to the front lines, and to join his forces at the Kissufim IDF outpost. According to an IDF eulogy, as he approached the area, he encountered burned-out cars on the side of the road, and sent photos to one of his soldiers, to warn them. As he approached the Mefalsim Junction, he encountered a cell of terrorists and was killed in an exchange of fire.\nZiv was considered missing for two weeks, until the IDF declared him dead, and a funeral was held on October 25. IDF troops recovered his remains during an operation on December 12, 2024. His burial was completed two days later on December 14, 2024, at the military cemetery in Holon.\nHis body was retrieved alongside that of Eden Zecharya, who was kidnapped from the Supernova music festival. In the operation to recover their bodies, Master Sgt. (res.) Gal Meir Eisenkot and Master Sgt. (res.) Eyal Meir Berkowitz were killed.\nHe is survived by his wife, Stav, their five-month-old daughter, Maya, and his two brothers, Oded and Aviv. His father, Jakob, died when he was 9 and his mother, Janet, died a year before he was killed.\nBorn and raised in Afula, Ziv decided as a teen that he wanted to enlist in the Golani Brigade and did so when he began his military service in February 2006. He was “an army man in every fiber of his being, loved and admired by his commanders, comrades and subordinates, and the beating heart of the 51st Battalion — his second home,” reads the IDF eulogy. “He served in the battalion for 18 years and his name preceded him as ‘the man who arranges everything,’ who solved every logistics problem… everything with modesty and humility.”\nIn 2012, he met Stav, who was serving as a logistics officer in the same battalion, and they started seriously dating. They wed in 2018, settling in Rishon Lezion before moving to Rehovot. In May 2023, just a few months before Ziv was killed, their daughter, Maya, was born.\nAt his second funeral, his widow, Stav, said she wanted the world to know “what an incredible person you were, you were always the first to help, always on the side of giving. You are a hero of Israel and everyone needs to know that.”\n“I miss you with every moment and every breath,” she added. “I am pained by our future that was cut short in the middle. Maya started daycare this week and I just keep thinking that if you were here you would hold my hand and tell me it was all going to be OK… You were my whole world, my other half, we were connected by our souls and we understood each other just by looking at each other without needing to speak.”\nStav promised that “Maya will be raised on our love and be brought up with all your values of dedication to others, diligence and love. She will be so proud of you the way that I am so proud of you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

Sergey Shmerkin, 32, a soldier in the 551st Brigade’s 697th Battalion, from Kiryat Shmona, was killed fighting Hamas in northern Gaza on November 10, 2024.\nSergey was killed in an explosion from a booby-trapped tunnel shaft next to a mosque in the Beit Hanoun area, that also took the lives of his comrades Maj. (res.) Moshe Leiter, Sgt. Maj. (res.) Yossi Hershkovitz and Master Sgt. (res.) Matan Meir.\nHe was buried in Kiryat Shmona on November 13. He is survived by his parents, Tatiana and Vyacheslav, his older brother Daniel and his girlfriend Maya.\nBorn in Tajikistan, his family moved to Israel in 2002, when he was 11 years old.\nHis loved ones said he always wanted to take part in reserves duty after finishing his mandatory service, but was never called up despite his best attempts. On October 7, he called himself up to take part in the war effort, heading south that morning amid the Hamas onslaught. On October 20, he shared a video to Facebook of the IDF’s ongoing ground operation in Gaza, writing: “Proud to be a part of this, the nation of Israel lives!”\nKiryat Shmona Mayor Avichai Stern eulogized the fallen soldier, writing that he was a “warrior at heart and loved Kiryat Shmona and the State of Israel very much. It pains my heart to say goodbye to an ambitious young man full of dreams that he will not get to realize.”\nThe Bashiri real estate company in Kiryat Shmona where he worked eulogized him as “the salt of the earth, a mythical chef, an incredible contractor, talented estate agent, great comedian and a huge smiler.”\nHis girlfriend, Maya, told Ynet that Sergey fell in love with northern Israel during his military service.\n“In his regular service, he was a commander in the Givati Brigade. He loved the north so much that he knew every detail. We would go hiking, and he would tell me about places more than I knew, and I grew up there. He had such a zest for life,” she said.\n“I used to tell him he was my gift; he brought so much light into my life. He was an amazing cook, and I loved his values and principles,” she added. “Even on his worst day, he would always say everything was fine and smile, always saying thank you, always blessed. A ray of sunshine.”\nWhen he was called up for reserve duty, Maya said the couple were already talking about getting engaged and holding a wedding.\n“His friends said he couldn’t stop talking about us, that he would come back with a ring. It was clear to us we would get married,” she recounted. “One time, sitting outside the hotel in Tel Aviv [where she was evacuated to after war broke out in the north], I talked to him on the phone and said, ‘Okay, let’s get married,’ and he said, ‘Alright, I’m calling the rabbi.’ We agreed that the next time he came out, we’d do it.

Vitaly Karasik, 38, a crime scene investigator in the Tel Aviv District, from Ashkelon, was killed fighting Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nVitaly was on duty as part of the security team at the festival when the Hamas attack began, a job he took to earn extra income for his family. Early that morning he told other police officers that he was working to evacuate the partygoers from the scene. When the heavily armed terrorists began to arrive, Vitaly headed to fend them off with just his handgun, and was killed in the exchange of fire.\nHe is survived by his wife, Yulia, their children, Polina and Daniel, his parents, Boris and Zina and his sister, Ora. He was buried at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem on October 8.\nBorn in Mogilev, Belarus, Vitaly moved to Israel with his family when he was 11 years old, settling in Ashdod.\nAfter finishing high school, he enlisted in the army and served as a combat medic in the 401st “Iron Tracks” Brigade in the Armored Corps, including during the Second Lebanon War.

You are my hero, our hero!”\n“Even when times were tough you never lost your optimism,” she said. “You were a wonderful father, you had two angels, Daniel and Polina, your children.

He is survived by his son, Rani, 5, his parents Smadar and Amram and his three older siblings, Shlomo, Shlomit and Racheli.\nAccording to a eulogy on the Ofakim municipal site, Shimi played soccer as a kid on the Maccabi Beersheba and the Hapoel Merhavim teams, and in later years he got a motorcycle that he loved to ride around.\nHe attended a dormitory high school in Kiryat Gat, and later got a job at a mechanic shop in Ofakim.\nHis son’s mother, Kesem, wrote on Facebook that “the house is empty and quiet without you, you took half of my soul with you.” Her older daughters, she wrote, “miss you and are pained and never stop thinking about you and about your generosity and everything you did for them.

    "story": "Elyakim Shlomo Libman, 23, from the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nFor seven months, he was presumed to be held hostage in Gaza, as no remains had ever been identified in Israel. But in May 2024, following an investigation, his remains were confirmed to have been accidentally buried alongside those of Victoria Gorelov/Brandis, who was also slain at the festival.\nBoth Elyakim and Victoria were working as security guards at the rave that morning. Some victims of the Hamas massacres had their bodies burned or otherwise mutilated beyond recognition, making identification difficult. They are both believed to have been killed while hiding in or next to an ambulance at the scene that was struck by a Hamas grenade, burning some of those inside beyond recognition, including Shani Gabay, who was also initially mistakenly buried with someone else.\nAccording to his family, Elyakim stayed behind for hours treating other wounded people until he himself was killed. Another security guard who survived said Elyakim and his friend and fellow guard, Eitan Mor stopped to help an injured woman, ignoring his pleas to flee the site and save themselves. Eitan was kidnapped and is believe to still be held hostage in Gaza.\nElyakim was buried in Hebron on May 5, 2024. He is survived by his parents, Avishag and Eliyahu, and his seven siblings: Emuna, Elkana, Elisha, Oriya, Oshra, Aviya and Avichay.\nHe grew up in the religious settlement of Kiryat Arba, where his father, Eliyahu, serves as the local council chief. After high school he attended the Telem pre-army academy, and then enlisted in the Golani Brigade for his mandatory military service. After being released, Elyakim decided to pursue culinary studies, and worked in restaurants as well as working for a jeep tour company.\nHe had moved to Tel Aviv just a few months before he was killed, his family said. His friends said he had hoped to study law in the future.\nWhile he was still considered missing, his sister, Emuna, told the Makor Rishon newspaper that he’s “incredible, with a huge heart who just wanted to give of himself, materially and spiritually. Full of love.” The family would call him “Robin Hood,” she joked, because of his desire to help those less fortunate.\n“He would tell me, ‘I have a few free hours, maybe I’ll come help you with the kids?’ He always wanted to help all the time, if you asked for assistance he was the first to show up, if others didn’t have strength he would always help… he’s always happy, helping, funny, full of good energy,” Emuna added.\nShe said that’s why his family wasn’t surprised to hear that he had been helping others at the festival, since “he couldn’t stand watching a situation where anyone was hurting someone weaker than them.”\nAt his funeral, his mother, Avishag, said her son was a “sweet, smiling, and smart boy” and was remembered for his good deeds by the “thousands” who attended the funeral.\n“We wanted you to get married at the Cave of the Patriarchs and in the end, we are burying you next to it,” Avishag lamented.\nShe told the Kan public broadcaster a week later that “as I know him, it could be that Elyakim would prefer not to be a hostage and be humiliated and instead to die heroically. But ultimately a mom wants her son by her side. I hoped for a different ending, that he was alive, that he would overcome the suffering… but God planned otherwise.”\nAvishag said that “from videos and witnesses we know that he treated the wounded and rescued people from the rave with a tractor… he was always acting with courage and dedication to save as many people as possible.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 331 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Maj. Tal Cohen, 30, a commander in the Sayeret Matkal unit from Ganei Tal in central Israel, was killed on October 7 while battling Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Kfar Aza.\nWith the start of the Hamas onslaught, Tal immediately headed to the front lines without waiting to be called, and met up with a number of other soldiers from his elite Sayeret Matkal unit. Nine of them headed to Kibbutz Kfar Aza, which was overrun with Hamas gunmen.\nTal — known to his friends as “TalCo” — and three others, Cpt. Hadar Kama, Maj. Ilay Zisser and Cpt. Amir Zur were slain in the massive firefight between the outnumbered soldiers and the terrorists.\nHe was buried on October 10 at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem. He is survived by his wife, Natali, their four children, Tzur, Ivri and Dror and Re’em — who was born five months after her father was killed. He is also survived by his parents, Rivka and Benzion, and his seven siblings Efrat, Eliraz, Doron, Gil, Hila, Yonatan and Nuriel.\nTzur, his oldest son, was born blind, and Tal’s name and memorial were written in braille in the National Memorial Hall on Mount Herzl to make it accessible.\nAt his funeral, his brother Eliraz noted that “every one of us had a job at home, that’s what it’s like when you grow up in a house with eight siblings.”\n“You were the glue,” he said. “When are we meeting at Mom and Dad’s, when are we having a barbecue, when are we going for a trip? You knew better than anyone to be quiet when the rest of us were talking, to calm us when we were stressed, to laugh when we didn’t know about what, to offer praise when we were quiet.”\nTal’s older sister Efrat wrote on Instagram ahead of Memorial Day that it was hard to connect him to “all this sadness.

My soul-searching as a person, as a warrior, as a commander. How much have I really fulfilled my duty, my responsibility, how dedicated I am to the task and to the people… Those who have fought, those who have lost friends in battle, those who have led commandos in riots and risked their lives — they know that the commander is obligated to his men to bring them home safely.”\nOn such a day, he wrote, “When I see those who are no longer here, the question always arises: Could things have been different?”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

He is survived by his wife, Karin, and their children Maya and Guy, as well as his parents, Adele and Michael, and his siblings.\nRonen was a physics teacher at the Eshel Hanasi High School between Ofakim and Beersheba and a faculty member at Ben Gurion University.\nIn a statement from the Education Ministry, Bat-Chen Peled, the principal of Eshel Hanasi, noted that Ronen had battled illness for many years, “but your love for your students caused you to fight and to come back to us quickly. You always showed up with a smile, the students and the education staff loved you and couldn’t praise you enough, you never gave up on any pupil and you believed in everyone. I lost not just a teacher, but also a friend.”\nHis sister-in-law, Einat Weingold, wrote on Facebook that she would remember him “with a beer in your hand and half a smile. A warm and embracing man, full of life. A man of people.”\nAnother sister-in-law, Vered Yosef-Daichman, wrote on Facebook, “I can’t believe we need to say goodbye to you, a dear and beloved man, a brother in my soul and a friend to all.”\n“Thank you for all that you left behind which will accompany us for life,” she added. “I promise to look after everyone, to find anew joy and belief in good and to celebrate life the way you knew how.”\nHis student, Hili Maimon, told Israel Hayom, “When you think about a physics teacher, you imagine a nerd in glasses, but Ronen was the coolest guy in the school. He knew when to tell us to get ahold of ourselves and to study and when to laugh with us and talk about life, and not just our studies. He had no problem talking to us during vacations or on Fridays, because he wanted to help us.”\nHili said that the day before he was killed, “he helped me with some homework he gave over the break. That was the last time we spoke.”\n“Ronen believed greatly in peace and he always taught us not to judge things superficially, but to try to bridge differences and talk to the other side,” she added. “We always knew that he could have kept working in hi-tech, but he chose to make a career change and become a teacher out of a belief that you have to do what you love in a way that fulfills you. We knew he really wanted to be in school with us.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Cpl. Neria Aharon Nagari, 18, a Home Front Command soldier, from the West Bank settlement of Talmon, was killed on October 7 at the Zikim IDF base.\nNeria had only enlisted in the IDF in mid-August, less than two months before he was killed. On the morning of the attack, he was stationed at the Zikim training base next to the Gaza border, along with around 90 other rookie trainees and a small number of commanders.\nWhen the Hamas onslaught began, the commanders immediately replaced the trainees at the guard posts, and ordered all the new enlistees to seek shelter. Neria was one of a small number of the trainees who decided instead to take part in the battle to prevent the base from being captured, and volunteered to help assist some of those who had already been wounded.\nWhile trying to help treat the injured, Neria was shot dead by a Hamas terrorist. Ultimately, six commanders on the base that day were slain — Maj. Adir Abudi, Cpt. Or Moses, Lt. Adar Ben Simon, 2nd Lt. Yannai Kaminka, Staff Sgt. Eden Alon Levy and Staff Sgt. Omri Niv Firshtein — but the base was not conquered.\nNeria was the only trainee to be killed during the attack, and the other 90 were saved by the quick thinking of the commanders.\nHe was buried on October 9 in Dolev. He is survived by his parents, Sharon and Refael, and his six siblings, Rivka, Reishit, Hadar, Yehuda, Michal and Eliya.\nAt his funeral, his father Rafael called him a “valuable diamond that we received as a gift from the heavens.”\n“You were born on the eve of Hanukkah, and you always added light,” he added. “Everywhere you went you made sure things were good. You took control whenever it was needed and demanded, and also there — at the IDF outpost where you were stationed — you made sure to protect them.”\nRafael said Neria “went through many journeys in your short but full life. All we have left is to take your light and spread it.”\nHis father said he last spoke to his son before Shabbat started, hours before the attack, “and you said that you felt good, that you had found the right place for you. I blessed you and told you that we love you. We were privileged to raise you, it seems that God wanted you with him.”\nNeria’s mother, Sharon, told a local radio station that her son, “throughout his life, what was important to him was to bring a good atmosphere everywhere he went. He would always note if a friend was having a hard time and take him to the side and calm him down.”\nSharon said Neria “was a very happy kid, but he was very deep. He wasn’t just happy and lighthearted, he was deep and smart and aware of his difficulties, of what was lacking… but you can’t think of Neria and be sad for too long, at some point you’ll definitely smile and probably even laugh when you think about one of his jokes. He would make us happy and make us laugh, he would want most for us to try and be happy. We have no doubt.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 334 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

Daniel Moshe Danino, 21, a Golani Brigade soldier from Haifa, was killed on October 7 at the Erez Crossing along the Gaza border.\nThe Erez Crossing was one of the points at which Hamas terrorists stormed into Israel that day, killing a number of soldiers stationed there, including Sgt. Adir Tahar, Staff Sgt. Max Rabinov and Sgt. Ariel Erez. The outnumbered soldiers tried to fight back the slew of terror invaders, but many, including Daniel, were ultimately killed in the firefight.\nDaniel was buried on October 11 in Kiryat Yam outside Haifa. He is survived by his parents, Anat and Shalom, and his older sisters Shani and Mirel.\nHe was three weeks away from finishing out his mandatory military service when he was killed, his family said, although he had already signed on to stay on longer in the army.\nHis family said he was deeply connected to his faith, always made sure to pray and don tefillin each day, and would sing Shabbat songs with great joy with his father every Friday night.\nRabbi Shlomi Kapach, the principal of Daniel’s high school, told a local radio station that “Daniel was a unique kid, and his optimism radiated out to everyone. No matter what area, he was always optimistic, was always smiling and always saw the good. It was rare to see him stressed or unsmiling, he was a consistent student, knew that he wanted to succeed and he succeeded!”\nThe principal added that Daniel was also a social center of his friend group, “I don’t think there was a single class where he wouldn’t make everyone laugh, including the teachers, in a unique way, and he would calm everybody down.”\nHis two older sisters spoke about their brother in a number of TV interviews memorializing his life.\n“Daniel was a boy with a huge joy for life, he loved everyone as they were, he always had a smile on his lips,” his sister, Mirel, told Channel 13 news. “He was simply a leader, he always made sure to unite and connect others,” including his friends from home and the soldiers he commanded.\n“He had a huge heart, he had a sensitivity to his surroundings, with his captivating smile and his huge heart, he knew how to touch every person,” Mirel added.\nHis sister Shani told the TV station that her little brother was a “sweet and friendly child, with a unique smile, who always made sure we were all together, at every event, every opportunity — we’re a very united and tied together family.”\nShani said Daniel was a “very caring and loving uncle, he always spent time with [his nieces and nephews] and took them to the beach and bought them birthday gifts.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Eden David Moshe, 27, of Holon, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nEden attended the rave with a group of four childhood friends — his girlfriend, Tamar Gutman, Ben Binyamin Cohen, Dor Toar and Yiftah Tweg — and all five were slain that day in the onslaught.\nThe five friends were buried side by side in the Gezer Regional Cemetery outside Modiin. Eden is survived by his parents, Vera and Boaz Moshe, and his five siblings: Sivan, Natali, Eliran, Daniel and Shalev.\nBorn in Jerusalem, Eden grew up in Beit Hashmonai, next to Ramle, studying in local schools and focusing on physics and chemistry classes during high school. After graduating, he enlisted in the IDF for his mandatory service as a combat soldier in the Artillery Corps. After his release, he took a long trip to South America with a group of friends.\nHe then enrolled in the Holon Institute of Technology, where he was studying electrical engineering. His loved ones said Eden was a devoted fan of the Manchester United soccer team — even traveling around the world to watch them play — loved hanging out with his family, especially his nephews, loved to dance and was always ready to help out his friends. His mother said he loved her cooking, in particular her Moroccan spicy fish, the couscous she made and her strawberry cake.\nHis sister Natali wrote on Facebook, “Eden my beloved brother — you are missed so much, every day that passes is harder. Your pure soul will always accompany us, the longing grows from day to day. We will forever be six [siblings]!! Keep on dancing up there with your friends. Forever, my brother, I’ll remember you always.”\nEden’s brother Daniel wrote online that they were separated only “by a year and a half, you were basically my twin brother. All of the things we went through together I will treasure in my heart — and there were many. You were always there to defend me and to protect me. You will be missed every moment in every place, you were always by my side and that’s how it will remain forever.”\nIn a memorial video, his mother, Vera, said Eden “was a perfect child. He never said ‘no’ to me or to his father. It wasn’t in his vocabulary. He was an excellent student, in school, they always wanted to skip him ahead a grade, he was a genius.”\nHe was very affectionate, she said, “When he came home from school he would kiss me, come into our room, hug and kiss all the time… He had a unique love for me.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Zion Levy, 72, from Moshav Dekel, was murdered by Hamas terrorists near the Mivtahim Junction in southern Israel on October 7.\nWith the start of the attack, Zion, who worked in agriculture for years, set out from his home Saturday morning to go collect two Thai workers who had been working in his son’s garden. His wife urged him to seek shelter, but after dropping them off he continued on his way home. As he passed the Mivtahim Junction, Zion was shot dead in his car by Hamas terrorists lying in wait.\nAfter days of searching, his family received word that his body had been identified.\nHe was buried on October 15 in Afula. He is survived by his wife, Tziona, his four children, Yaniv, Ziv, Shira and Hadas, and a number of grandchildren.\nBorn in Yavne’el, Zion was raised in Afula by parents who had immigrated from Yemen. Already in school, he studied agriculture, and he then studied in the Techni high school to prepare him to enlist in the Air Force. During his mandatory service, he served as an aircraft mechanic, including during the Yom Kippur War.\nAfter marrying in 1976, he and Tziona settled in Yamit, a settlement in the Sinai Desert where he continued as a career Air Force commander at the Eitam Air Base. In 1982, when Yamit was evacuated and the Sinai was handed back to Egypt, Zion and Tziona were among the founders of Dekel, a small community along the Israeli-Egyptian border, where they remained for more than 40 years.\nIn Dekel, Zion worked for decades in agriculture, growing flowers and vegetables. With his retirement from the fields six years ago, he took up a new career — as a bus driver who loved shuttling passengers around the area.\nHis daughter Shira shared on Facebook the eulogy she read at her father’s funeral, about a man to whom “everything was possible, everything was allowed. Showing up in your underwear to Pnina’s wedding is OK, learning how to drive as soon as your leg reaches the clutch pedal is possible, and coming home with a stray cat or dog is wonderful.”\n“Dad, you were an eternal child, you were like a brother and a friend to us,” she added. “You were the best teacher and guidance counselor we ever had. The personal example you set for us of loving others, supporting others, generosity and helping others, modesty and integrity shaped our character. You taught us to take responsibility for our actions, you always believed in us and supported us, encouraged us to dream and to act.”\nHer father, wrote Shira, was “a man of people, always surrounded by family and friends. Stayed in touch, always up to date, at the center of things. You succeeded in being loved by all, from young children to the elderly. You looked everyone in the eye and had trust and respect for everyone. If you heard about anyone having trouble, anyone needing help, you would show up immediately, without questions, and help them with no compensation. You had an enormous heart, you gave all of yourself to others.”\nZion’s peak achievement, however, she said, was becoming a grandfather: “How you were so looking forward to this moment! Your grandchildren were everything to you. When you were with them, the world stopped on its axis. You never rushed anywhere, you played, fed, changed diapers, bathed and read stories,” Shira wrote. “You just wanted more and more of them — all day. All with a pure love, true pleasure, endless patience and huge pride.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 337 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

    "story": "Sgt. First Class Dor Mangadi, 24, a police officer in the coordination of enforcement operations unit (MATPA), from Rosh Ha’ayin, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Be’eri.\nDor was called into work early that morning with the start of the attack, and headed south to meet up with his fellow officers and receive orders. He was sent with seven other police officers into Be’eri, the site of some of the heaviest fighting that day. As they entered the kibbutz, their jeeps were ambushed by an onslaught of RPGs and gunfire, and seven of them were killed, including Dor and Supt. Vadim Blih.\nBecause of the heavy fire damage to the jeeps and the chaos in Be’eri, it took 10 days for his body to be identified. Dor was buried on October 16 in Rosh Ha’ayin. In March, his family was told that additional bones belonging to Dor were found near where he was killed, and his grave was reopened to have them placed inside.\nHe is survived by his parents, Iris and Shaltiel, and his five siblings Nir, Shani, Yoni, Talya and Maayan.\nDuring his mandatory army service, Dor served in the Golani Brigade, and after finishing he enlisted in the Israel Police. His older brother Nir and his younger brother Yoni are also both police officers. Loved ones said that he was very close to his family members, in particular his mother, who he took care of with great devotion.\nTwo months after he was killed, his brother, Nir, wrote on Instagram that the loss was still impossible to comprehend.\n“Time hasn’t healed anything, not the pain, not the longing, it has only intensified and increased it,” wrote Nir. “My Dor, I miss you, your smile, your voice, your presence. My heart hurts, bleeds, burns with longing… my brother, my blood, I would do anything to bring you back, if only it were possible. I love you my beloved brother, and I miss you endlessly.”\nDor’s older sister, Talya, wrote on Facebook about how much she misses him, “I miss your craziness, I miss our arguments, I miss sitting with you at night on the balcony, I miss the moments you took care of Mom, we are all trying to be with her but you were the best of everyone. I miss the moments you went nuts cleaning the house and handing out orders.”\n“You are the best police officer and warrior, you are a hero, you are the kid with the biggest heart, the most unique of your friends, the magic in the world,” she added. “It drives me crazy to think that you will never walk through the door again and shout, ‘Dor the king has arrived,’ it drives me crazy that your chair will sit empty on Shabbat and holidays, it drives me crazy that your room will remain forever a memorial to you.”\nA month after he was killed his mother, Iris, wrote on Facebook that on October 7, Dor “left with a smile and you didn’t know it was the last time I would see you.”\n“I sat for days and for hours on the sofa waiting, that you would maybe enter and jump on me, but it didn’t happen,” she added. “My Dor, my child, my life has changed, I sit every day and scream in my heart, in pain, refusing to believe. I can’t believe I will never see you again, I don’t know how to go on, how to get up, how?

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Ofek Arbib, 21, a member of the Paratroopers Brigade from Bat Yam, was killed on October 7 while fleeing the Supernova music festival during an off-duty weekend.\nOfek headed to the rave with a group of friends on Friday night after a holiday meal at his grandmother’s house. With the start of the attack, he and his friends were among the first to leave, and he called another friend who had stayed behind to warn him about the terrorist invasion, saving his life, according to an IDF eulogy.\nAround 7 a.m., Ofek and his friends got to the Yad Mordechai junction where Hamas terrorists were lying in wait. Ofek protected them with his body and was killed by the gunfire, while the two friends escaped the car and ran for safety. After five days of searching, Ofek’s body was identified. His family said that all of his other friends who attended the rave managed to survive.\nHe was buried in Holon on October 12. He is survived by his parents, Ilana and Nissim, his older siblings Snir, Meshi and Bar and his stepsisters, Tal and Shahar.\nBorn and raised in Jerusalem, he moved at 15 to Bat Yam to live with his father and attend high school there. Ofek had a number of different hobbies, including photography, Thai boxing, and all sorts of sport and exercise, even hiking the Israel Trail while he was in high school.\nAt age 20 he bought a motorcycle and had dreams of an extensive bike trip overseas with his father. In his memory, family and friends staged a motorcycle convoy, marking a month since his funeral. After finishing high school, Ofek spent six months in a pre-army academy, and in 2021 he enlisted in the Paratroopers Brigade, hoping to later pursue an officer’s course.\nHis sister, Bar, wrote on Instagram in December to Ofek that her “revenge is to keep living, to smile our smile, to laugh and make others laugh like only we knew how, to take your trip to the Far East, to go to the beach for you.\n“To travel around Israel like you loved so much, to be a new sister to your friends, to be a sister to your comrades,” she wrote. “To pass through the boardwalk where you used to come with your motorcycle and sit for coffee. My revenge will be in the shape of life, the shape of pure love, the shape of generosity, the shape of a wide heart to anyone who needs it.\n“My revenge will be in the shape of art, in the shape of music you loved all the time,” she added. “My revenge will be to memorialize your life, and not to live with the grief and your death. Our revenge is to stay the siblings we were.”\nOfek’s father, Nissim, told a local news site that his son was “a lot of fun, a daddy’s boy, the kind that every father would dream of having. He was a friend and a son together. A kid who never asked for money, he always knew how to work things out, and he spread love to the world.”\n“He would see people begging on the street and he would give them money like he was a Rothschild,” his father added. “If needed, he’d collect donations and bring food to people’s homes. More than once he called me from the army and said, ‘Someone in Bat Yam’s house burned down, we need to help them.’… He’d convince us to go, to buy paint and help them fix the house. You could never say no to him.”\nNissim said that Ofek’s dream “was always when he was released from the army, we’d go on a joint [motorcycle] trip to all sorts of places, we were planning to go together to Morocco and Italy… Sadly, we’ll never get to go on those trips.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Michel Nisenbaum, 59, from Sderot, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Mefalsim junction on October 7, and his body kidnapped to Gaza.\nHis body was recovered by IDF troops from Gaza on May 24, 2024, and he was brought to burial in Israel. He was laid to rest on May 26 in Ashkelon.\nMichel was on his way to the IDF’s Gaza Division base near Re’im to collect his young granddaughter, Mika, who had been staying with his non-commissioned officer son-in-law, but he never made it to the base that was under attack that morning. His granddaughter and son-in-law managed to survive the onslaught.\nHis family said they were speaking with him on the phone early that morning when the call abruptly ended. Nearly 30 minutes later, they said, his daughter managed to get through and heard an unfamiliar voice speaking Arabic. His car was later found burned, although there was no trace of him inside. His family did not know of his fate until his body was recovered by troops seven months later.\nMichel is survived by his two daughters, Chen and Michal, and six grandchildren, one of whom was born after he was killed and kidnapped.\nA native of Niteroi, a suburb of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Michel moved to Israel in 1988. The Hostage Families Forum said he “was a man of many talents who, alongside his work, also volunteered for Magen David Adom and the Border Police.”\nMichel worked at the “Salad Trail” farm in Talmei Yosef near the southern Gaza border as a guide to tour groups, explaining about the many different crops they managed to cultivate in the arid desert.\n“Everyone fell in love with him. I taught him about agriculture, but he learned it all very quickly and makes such good connections with all our customers,” his boss, Uri Alon, told the Forward. “The last thing he did was typical Michel Nisenbaum: Someone asked for help and he jumped to do it.”\nAt his funeral, his daughter, Chen, said, “We did everything so that everyone would get to know you. Sorry we weren’t able to bring you back.”\n“From the second the terrorists answered your cell phone, I knew that life would not be the same,” she said. “The children will grow up and remember what a heroic grandfather you were, who was not afraid of the terrorists and saved people on the way. Thanks to you, they are here. I love and miss you.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Itay Avraham Ron, 20, a Golani soldier from Ness Ziona, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the Nahal Oz IDF outpost.\nAccording to a eulogy on the Ness Ziona municipal website, Itay, Lt. Yohai Dukhan, Warrant Officer Ibrahim Kharuba and a fourth soldier named Nimrod — who were trained to protect the base and its personnel — battled the Hamas gunmen down to their last bullets outside the Nahal Oz command center, attempting to protect the base’s war room and the surveillance soldiers holed up inside.\nBut as the attackers advanced, the troops eventually became trapped in the command center itself along with a number of surveillance soldiers. Itay, Yohai and Ibrahim were all killed, as were almost all of the soldiers inside the war room. Nimrod survived.\nItay was buried on October 13 in Ness Ziona. He is survived by his mother, Dorit, and brother Amit. His father, Eran, died of a heart attack when Itay was 14.\nHis family said Itay was involved in sports from a young age and was always active — at age 6 he started learning capoeira, and by 11 he was an assistant to the coach and winning local contests. He also served as a soccer referee from ages 15-18 and was a devoted fan of the Hapoel Tel Aviv team.\nEnlisting in a combat position was his utmost goal, and he worked out strenuously for two years at the end of high school to raise his preparedness level, even bringing in friends to his workout routine with the same goal.\nHis mother, Dorit, told the Kan public radio that her son and the other two officers “were heroes, they fought until their last moments, and I know that Itay, if he would come back there again today, would do exactly the same thing — even if he knew that it would have the same outcome.”\n“I don’t have words to describe the pride he brought me and the privilege to be called the mother of Itay,” she added.\nDorit added that her son “was a fighter. His friends said he was a fighter, he never gave up for a moment, and he always put others ahead of himself. He was always last, he always wanted things to be good for everyone else. He truly was a hero of Israel who sacrificed himself for others.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nWe’re really pleased that you’ve read 343 Times of Israel articles in the past month.\nYou clearly find our careful reporting valuable, in a time when facts are often distorted and news coverage often lacks context.\nYour support is essential to continue our work.

Bilha and Yakov were survived by their five children, Mor, Maayan, Maoz, Magal and Magen, and 11 grandchildren.\nIn an interview with Channel 12 news in February, Maayan Inon said, “Dad sent us a WhatsApp message at 7:30 a.m. that they’re sitting in the safe room, the house is locked, and they’re hearing a lot of shooting and rockets.”\n“By 7:45 a.m. they were already disconnected and not answering,” she said. “The house got a direct hit [likely from an RPG] and was on fire within minutes. This was a house built with light materials like plaster and plywood.”\nWriting in the Guardian in October, the couple’s son Magen Inon said that “the pain is unbearable. My parents were a stable rock in my and my family’s life, and the only consolation I have is that they died together. Inseparable in life and death.”\nMagen said that his parents “lived fulfilling and happy lives and touched many people.” Yakov, he said, was a professional agronomist while Bilha was an early childhood education teacher and an artist.\nBilha and Yakov requested in their will that their bodies be cremated and spread out over the grounds of Netiv Ha’asara because they did not want their bodies to take up land.\nThe couple’s children have emphasized in interviews about the October 7 atrocities that their parents were lifelong peace activists who believed in reaching out and building bridges.\nMaoz Inon told The New York Times that even in unthinkable times, he is continuing to pursue the path of peace as part of “my mom’s legacy. And I’m taking it for my mom. I’m taking it for my father. We will always have the reasons to hate. But I’m saying, one day, we’ll have to start using the power of reconciliation, the power of forgiveness.”\nSpeaking to Haaretz, Maayan said that despite her parents’ location just meters from the Gaza border, “they felt safe.”\n“My dad always said: ‘We can’t live in fear,’” she said. “He claimed that fear is a subjective thing and he didn’t really feel it. My mom had some bouts of fear and anxiety. But they still chose to stay because they loved the area and the people, they were pillars of their community, and they lived well.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here.\nIf so, we have a request. \nEvery day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention.

    "story": "Chief Petty Officer Ofek Rousso, 21, a Shayetet 13 soldier in the Israel Navy, from Kadima Zoran, was killed on October 8 while battling Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 8.\nOfek was on his base in Atlit the morning of October 7, and like many others was sent down south by the army to counter the Hamas invasion. He and his unit arrived at Kibbutz Be’eri that afternoon, after first stopping in Ofakim and assisting a number of wounded.\nIn Be’eri, he and his comrades went house by house looking for survivors and the wounded and killing Hamas terrorists holed up inside. Around 2:15 a.m. the next day, two soldiers were shot and seriously wounded in the kibbutz and Ofek ran to treat them. He was shot and killed on the spot as he protected one of the wounded with his body. That soldier was later rescued and survived, Ofek’s family said.\nOfek is survived by his parents, Faye and Yaniv, and his older sister Inbar. He was buried on October 12 in Kadima.\nHe grew up in Kfar Netter in central Israel, and explored a number of hobbies, including karate, skateboard and musical instruments — learning over the years to play the saxophone, guitar and drums, according to a memorial website. He even attended a skateboarding camp one summer in the US and was a regular in the Israeli skateboarding scene. He loved music of many different genres, and learned to play his favorites on the guitar. He loved to eat, especially red meat, and enjoyed steaks and his mother’s spaghetti bolognese.\nAfter finishing high school, Ofek attended HaEmek pre-army academy to prepare him for an elite army position, and just before his 19th birthday he enlisted, underwent paramedic training and began the challenging Shayetet 13 course, which he completed with great pride a few months before he was killed.\nAfter his death, Ofek’s family found in his phone a number of notes he had written to himself, including one reading: “We cannot forget our past, the people thanks to whom we are here, my brothers who were killed on this land. For 2,000 years they persecuted us, and now we are here in our own country, as fighters. We’re not leaving here. Now is our turn to protect the nation.”\nWriting in a Times of Israel blog post, Ofek’s uncle, Dotan Rousso, said his family wants Ofek to know “how much you meant to us. How much we appreciate you. How much we loved you.”\n“How much you were a source of admiration — a role model. You had an inner calm, resilience, humility, and modesty beyond compare. Self-discipline. Iron will. Maturity. Kindness. Tenderness and innocence,” he wrote. “Your life was so short but meaningful and more deserving than the long lives of many. You fulfilled your dreams, lived a meaningful life, were a role model for others, and finally gave your life to save others.”\nHis girlfriend, Roni Ben Hur, wrote online that “Ofek, you were the best thing that ever happened to me, how could it be that it ended like this? You are the most unique and incredible person there is,” she added. “You are so strong, and yet so very gentle, you are so brave, and yet very sensitive.”\nThe last time they saw each other, she wrote, was his 21st birthday, on October 2, when they sat and watched the sunset on the beach, and “we spoke about the past year and a half, we also laughed. We talked about your journey, your experiences with your family and friends, our experiences together, your service as a combat soldier in a place you loved so much, and your expectations for the future… Your birthday was also the last time I hugged you, and I can’t believe that it was the last time forever.”\nOfek’s mother, Faye, wrote online that he always set himself goals, “didn’t allow your fears to hold you back and you saw the obstacles in your way as challenges.”\n“You are with me every moment,” she wrote. “I imagine you smiling at me, I have conversations with you. I ask you what you think and you always answer me: ‘Mom, I’m with you, all the time. Look around. Look for a sign, I’m with you, with Dad, with Inbar, with grandma and grandpa, with all of the family, with my friends.

    "story": "Oron Beilin, 24, from Ramat Gan, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nWhen the onslaught began, Oron hid in bushes near the site of the rave. He told both his mother and his girlfriend that he was in Tel Aviv so that they wouldn’t worry, while texting a friend about his attempts to escape. The friend last heard from him around 11 a.m. that morning.\nFor six days his family searched for word of his fate, until his body was ultimately identified. Oron was buried in Tel Aviv on October 15.\nHe is survived by his parents, Rina and Moshe. He was named in honor of his grandfather, Dr. Aharon Beilin, a Holocaust survivor who testified at the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1961.\nUpon finishing high school, Oron enlisted in the IDF, serving at the Defense Ministry headquarters in a computer-related role, later switching to serve as a driver at the Maklef Camp in Ramat Gan, the headquarters of the IDF Adjutant Corps.\nAfter his mandatory service, he worked in a number of start-ups, and was slated on October 15 to begin a degree in electrical engineering at the Afeka College of Engineering — following a year of prep studies in math.\nOron’s biggest love was basketball, his friends said, and he enjoyed playing as well as following the NBA, especially his favorite team, the Chicago Bulls. One of his favorite players, DeMar DeRozan, signed a jersey in his memory.\nHis girlfriend of five years, Lior Halevie, who met Oron in the army, described him as a “very smart kid who loved to achieve excellence in everything.”\n“Oron very much loved to always be on the move and not to rest, he loved to feel alive,” she wrote. “Oron went everywhere with a speaker and played music all the time, he was a fan of Eminem and Travis Scott, but he would also listen to the Beatles, Bob Marley and other genres.”\nLior wrote that since they got together, “we matured together, went through countless experiences together good and bad, and we learned what true love is… five years of an incredible relationship and a close and loving friendship.”\n“We thought that we were inseparable, no matter how many difficulties there were, we got through them all,” she added. “We planned so many things for the future, thoughts on a proposal in Austria, what our children will look like, where we’ll raise them and what vacations we would take them on… after so long together, it felt like we were already one soul. Oron departed and took with him so many parts of me.”\nHis mother, Rina, wrote online to, “Oron, my light, who will remain my love forever.”\n“You went and left all of us in a darker world, and mine is almost black,” she wrote. “Thank you for 24 wonderful, happy years. Since you were born, I thanked God every day for bringing me such a wonderful, smiling, funny, smart, kind, modest, beautiful, magical, basketball-playing son.”\n“It was my privilege to be your mother,” Rina added. “Such a unique boy who always loved to help everyone. You loved Savta Esther’s food so much. My life won’t be what it was.”\nAmid her deep sadness, she wrote, “I promise I will laugh every time I remember you, you were so funny! A cute impressionist, smiling and kind.

Dekel confronted the assailants, shooting at them to protect the other members of his unit, and subsequently fell in battle on the morning of his 20th birthday.\nThe fallen soldier was one of five children born to Liron and Deganit Dekel in the West Bank settlement of Immanuel. Dekel’s older sister described him as a fun-loving, caring younger brother brimming with joie de vivre.\n“You always smiled, always radiated light, it was always important to you that everyone was okay, it was always important to you that mom had what she needed — you made sure to spoil her at every opportunity and get her to rest,” eulogized Renen Dekel.\n“You were always happy with what you had, would give things up for your sisters so that they could have the best there is and you did everything with a smile and calm,” she continued.\nDekel’s friends and family noted his love of singing. Tehila, his other older sister, recalled that he would grab a microphone and sing “any moment he could.”\nRacheli Reisberg, Dekel’s girlfriend, fondly reminisced on times when the couple would sing Amir Benayoun’s “Standing at the Gate” together.\nShe described her late boyfriend in an Instagram post as the “smartest kid in the class, who will always be there for you, who sings like an angel and makes you laugh until your stomach hurts.”\nDekel’s funeral was held on October 13 in the Rosh Ha’ayin cemetery.

    "story": "Yaakov Mortov, 66, from Ofakim, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in Sderot on October 7.\nYaakov was one of 13 senior citizens on a minibus that was heading toward the Dead Sea who were slain in Sderot that day. The minibus stopped with a flat tire next to a bus stop in the city. In a final photo taken of him alive, Yaakov can be seen sitting on the bench of the bus stop holding his cane.\nAs the group was standing at the bus stop, air raid sirens sounded in the city, and the automated doors of the bomb shelter were supposed to unlock, but they remained shut and the travelers were unable to get inside. Moments later, a pick-up truck of terrorists drove by and shot dead all 13 pensioners. Only the driver emerged alive.\nImages of the group of older Israelis lying dead at the bus stop were among the first to circulate on the morning of the Hamas onslaught, shocking Israelis and the world with the brutality of the assault.\nYaakov’s body was not identified for close to two weeks following his murder. He was buried in Ofakim on October 18. He is survived by his two sons, Alexei and Michael.\nAccording to a eulogy from the Ofakim municipality, Yaakov was born in Rostov-on-Don in what is now Russia, and moved when he was 10 years old to northern Russia along the border with Finland. A few years later he returned to his hometown to finish his high school studies before enlisting in the army and serving for two years in the engineering corp.\nAfter his service, Yaakov returned to Rostov-on-Don and studied economics for seven years, earning his doctorate. Despite this, he worked for years as a mechanic at a factory on the internal transportation network for workers. In 1996, his wife and children moved to Israel and in 1997 he followed.\nAt the time of his death, Yaakov had been working for around three years at the Beit Hayotzer – ADI Ofakim employment center, where he assembled electronic circuits for “Flex” smart home devices.\nHis managers at work remembered Yaakov as a “quiet and humble man. He was a professional and did his work well, he was friendly and pleasant to be around.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Daniel Bezgodov, 21, a soldier in the Nahal Brigade’s reconnaissance unit from Afula, was killed on October 7.\nHis family said that when the Hamas onslaught began, he was on a routine patrol of the area around Kibbutz Sufa when they were attacked and his commander was killed. Daniel took charge, and they later encountered further terrorists cells and he was slain in the firefight after killing a number of terrorists.\nHe was buried on October 13 in Afula. Daniel is survived by his mother, Margarita, and his siblings Sandra, Vladislav, Yasmin and Adam.\nAs a lover of nature, in his memory Afula named a section of a park in the city “Nahal Daniel Park,” unveiling a sign and a plaque there in his honor. He was dedicated to his gym workout, loved animals and hiking, and fought hard to serve in an elite military unit.\nHis friend Natan Edri wrote on Facebook about “the man, the personality, the hero of Israel.”\n“Bezgodov was the best person I knew, and I witnessed this from the very beginning of getting to know him,” wrote Edri. “A big guy, handsome, physically very strong with muscles as big as his heart. He never hurt a fly. He always sought out and did only good. Everybody always went along with him even without wanting to… [He was ] loved by everyone, accepted everything with love, always had a smile on his face.”\nHis girlfriend of two years, Stav Levy, wrote online to “my whole world, my other half, the love of my life.”\n“Daniel was different than all the other people I knew, the first time I saw him I was so moved that it was hard to breathe, I thought he was the most beautiful person I’d ever seen in life — and when we got to know each other deeply I realized that however handsome he was on the outside, he was so much more beautiful inside,” wrote Stav.\n“He was a perfect boyfriend like in the fairytales, the type who picks flowers, writes love letters and takes us to couples workshops so that we can develop our relationship together,” she added. “Daniel was the most determined and competitive man I knew, everything he did he had to do his best. He was hilarious, a chatterbox, and loved dancing of any kind, anywhere (including in the middle of the street).”\nHis mother, Margarita, told a local radio station that “Daniel was meant to be released from the army in another six months, and he wanted to get married, he had plans in life — this boy, this man of mine. He had a lot of plans, he had a lot of joy for life, and his heart was so full of love.”\nMargarita said Daniel “loved nature, loved his family, loved his girlfriend. He was just all light, a sun, I don’t know how to explain his life in other words.” Her son, she said, “was a fighter, was a leader since birth… I can’t breathe without him. It’s such a deep hole in my heart. The same with all his siblings, his girlfriend, his friends — they all loved him. He always had a smile, he loved his life.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

His home was completely burned down in the attack, and his body was not identified until 10 days later. He was buried on October 22 in a temporary burial in Kibbutz Revivim.\nHe is survived by his partner, Orly Meir, daughter Lior Bar, granddaughters Lea and Romi and his two younger brothers, Moshe and Yigal. David’s son, Harel, died in 2017.\nDavid was born to Turkish immigrant parents and grew up in Ramat Gan, but always wanted to explore kibbutz life, according to a eulogy. At age 16 his parents finally let him move by himself to Be’eri, where he remained for most of the rest of his life.\nHe enlisted in the army in 1969, serving in the Nahal Brigade, and was later called into reserve duty during the Yom Kippur War, during which he was wounded in his arm. He worked in a number of jobs in the kibbutz over the years, including in carpentry, in the kitchen, and later in the printing house.\nDavid’s nephew, Aaron Kader told the BBC that his uncle “was a huge part of our family, the life and soul of it.”\n“He was a larger-than-life character, who had the ability to make us all laugh,” he added.\nHis cousin, Gali Karol Rozental, paid tribute on Facebook to “my older cousin, older than me by 20 years, but he had a special relationship with us five sisters, like the big brother we never had.”\n“To get a hug from Karol (what everyone called him) was like being wrapped in a giant quilt, he was a big kibbutznik and his embrace was always strong, from his whole, wide heart. He loved life, he held on to it even when there were moments that broke him, he would take a deep breath and find the beauty in tending to his garden, in traveling, singing.”\nHis daughter, Lior, wrote on Memorial Day that she couldn’t help but think about her father’s final thoughts.\n“I imagine to myself that you must have worried about me and the girls,” she wrote. “After all, you were an anchor for us and you knew this. I want to believe that you left with the knowledge that everyone really close to you would succeed and keep going with joy in their hearts, between the moments of longing and missing.”\n“They will maintain your path of taking care of your plants, your humor, your good food and your attempts not to take things too hard, because ‘what can you do, this is how it is,’ as you always said with your hands in the air,” she added.\nLior said that she mostly wants to believe that the souls of her father, her brother Harel and her late husband Erez “are floating in light and goodness and watching over our hearts, to make sure they will keep beating and being happy in the face of such darkness.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was slain in the firefight and his body was kidnapped by the terrorists.\nHis family was informed on November 28, 2023, that Ravid had been killed during the October 7 onslaught. On July 24, 2024, his body was brought back to Israel for burial following an IDF operation in Khan Younis.\nHe was buried in Nir Oz on July 28, on what would have been his 52nd birthday.\nA member of the Nir Oz local security team, Katz was posthumously recognized by the Defense Ministry as a fallen soldier with the rank of sergeant major in the reserves.\nRavid’s half-sister, Doron Katz-Asher, and her two daughters, Raz and Aviv, were kidnapped by Hamas that day and released on November 24 — four days before his death was confirmed.\nHe is survived by his partner, Revital, their four-month-old daughter Alma, his children Shahar, 12, and Shira, 9, (whom he shared with his ex-wife Hila), his parents, Moshe and Yardena and his sisters Michal, Leeor and Doron.\nRavid was born and raised in Nir Oz, a place his loved ones said he never dreamed of leaving.

    "story": "Master Sgt. Ari Zenilman, a reservist in the Fifth Brigade, was killed in battle with Hamas in Khan Younis on December 10.\nZenilman, an American-Israeli who made aliyah with his family during his adolescent years, was described by his loved ones as a thoughtful and hard-working father who cared deeply about his family.\n“Ari, at this stage of his life, was first and foremost a husband and a father, that was the most important thing to him,” said his mother, Lisa Weinsoff, to The Times of Israel.\nOn the morning of October 7, Zenilman hurried to Israel’s south to help fend off Hamas’s invasion with the rest of his reserve unit. He and his fellow soldiers initially fought in Kissufim, and were later deployed to Kibbutz Re’im, Kfar Aza and Nahal Oz.\nZenilman’s unit was sent into Gaza soon after the negotiated truce between Israel and Hamas expired at the start of December. On December 3, Zenilman called his wife and parents to let them know that he was handing in his cell phone, with the implication that he would soon be deployed to Gaza.\nA week later, Zenilman was killed in Khan Younis. He was buried at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem on December 11 and left behind his widow, Chava, and three children, Achiya, Tali and Maayan. The couple’s youngest child, Maayan, was born only a week before Hamas launched its devastating attack on Israel.\nBorn in New York to Robert and Lisa Weinsoff Zenilman, Ari was the eldest of five siblings. His family moved to Ma’ale Adumim as he was entering 9th grade, and he quickly mastered Hebrew.\nLisa recalled that her son would often tell people, even other English-speakers, to talk to him only in Hebrew so that he could learn the language.\n“Everyone seemed to know really early on that Ari was blessed with a brilliant mind,” she said. “He loved to read, he read from when he was a child. As a teenager and adult he always had a book with him whether it was a sefer mishna, gemara or his Kindle.”\nThough he was exceptionally intelligent, those close to Zenilman added that he was also humble and and down to earth.\n“Ari was pretty much always the smartest person in the room. For anyone else, that fact would have been a defining character trait. Not for Ari. It’s not that he didn’t care about his intelligence, he just never wore it as a badge. It was just a tool he used to be a better person and a better Jew,” noted Ilan Mintz, his longtime friend.\nAfter finishing high school, Zenilman enrolled in a hesder program at Har Etzion yeshiva, enabling him to combine his army service in the Nahal Brigade with Torah study.\n“He wanted to go to yeshiva, he wanted hesder and he wanted a combat role,” Lisa said. “That really mattered to him.”\nZenilman met his wife, Chava, in his sixth and final year at yeshiva. The two got married during his first year at Hebrew University, where he studied philosophy, political science and economics while working as a research assistant at the Kohelet Policy Forum.\nAfter their marriage, the two moved to Jerusalem, where they raised their children. Zenilman began working at the Central Bureau of Statistics after graduating with his bachelor’s, and later on made the switch into the high-tech industry working for Mobileye, a vehicle tech company.\nChava Zenilman, his widow, recalled that despite working in high-tech, a demanding industry which requires long hours from employees, her husband would always make time for family.\n“Ari always made the effort. He brought the kids to gan [preschool] in the morning… He made the effort to leave work a little earlier to see the kids every day, to eat dinner with them and read them a goodnight book,” she said.\nShe added that even when he started his master’s degree while working a full-time job, he still found time for his children.\n“He was my inspiration. When we met, I knew that I married someone who will be my best friend, the love of my life… but also he was so inspiring to me,” Chava said. “I experienced him as a role model, that’s why I wanted him to be the father of my kids.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Without realizing that terrorists had infiltrated Ofakim, Iftah went out to the stairwell to smoke a cigarette, and he was shot dead by Hamas gunmen. Mariya, hearing the noise, went out after him and was also shot dead. The rest of the family locked the door and barricaded themselves inside and were able to survive the attack.\nIftah was buried on October 12 in Ofakim, and Mariya was buried alongside him four days later, on October 16. They are survived by their three children, Sara, Edgar and Elinor, a grandson and their siblings. Another grandchild was on the way when they were killed.\nThe couple were both born in Derbent, in southern Russia. According to a eulogy from the Ofakim municipality, Iftah served as a driver in the Soviet army and later worked as a civilian truck driver. Mariya studied accounting and was in charge of payroll at a factory.\nThe couple wed in 1980, and all three of their children were born in Derbent. They made aliyah to Israel in 1993, settling first in Beersheba and then in Ofakim. Iftah worked at a packaging factory in Netivot, where Mariya also worked for a period. In 2021 she opened a store in Beersheba called Elinor, after their youngest daughter.\nThe couple loved to travel, including going back to their native Russia. Mariya enjoyed reading Russian literature, and Iftah loved to walk around the city on foot, as well as spend hours at the beach.\nThe couple’s niece, Tamara Halele Rubinov, said, “My heart is burning in pain… rest in peace. Watch over us from above, now you are in a better and more pure place.” Addressing her aunt Mariya, she added: “I’m begging you to send me strength to continue life without you. From now on I’m alone, you promised to help me, now I know that you will guide me from the pure place where you went.”\nTheir niece, Dina Avramov, said she could not believe the news, “I want to wake up from this nightmare and pick up the phone and call you and say ‘Manyonina, you won’t believe that I dreamed about you guys,’ and you would respond what you always said, that someone who dies in a dream will have a long life.”\nTheir son Edgar told the Ofakim municipal site that he and his father “would do everything together, he was like my best friend. Anywhere my Dad would go, he took me with him, not necessarily for me to help him, just for any little thing… He would tell me everything, I felt very free with him. My dad was a role model to me, I would rely on him and connect to him. He was really like my friend, very relaxed and chill, I always felt he was like my peer and my friend.”\nOf his mother, Edgar said that Mariya “would do everything to give us what we needed and wanted. My mother would cook delicious and unique Kavkazi food. We would mark every holiday and event with a big celebration, with all the family. All the cousins, grandmother, siblings would come, it would always be happy, with a lot of delicious food and family time.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

The terrorists attempted to use the civilians as pawns to negotiate with Israeli security forces, aiming to take the hostages to Gaza and secure themselves safe passage.\nSurvivors said the terrorists positioned the hostages between themselves and the IDF soldiers, and after hours holed up inside, the IDF fired tank shells at the building and soldiers advanced toward the terrorists who were barricaded inside. Only one of the hostages emerged alive (another had exited earlier while being used as a human shield). In an in-depth probe published months later, the IDF said that many of the hostages were apparently killed by gunfire.\nFor 11 days after the attack the Haker family did not know of Ze’ev and Zehava’s fate, until their bodies were finally identified.\nThey were buried in Kibbutz Kvutzat Shiller on October 19. The couple are survived by their three children, Limor, Dvir and Hagay, and 11 grandchildren.\nZehava was born in Givatayim and came by herself to the kibbutz at age 9 in the 1960s, while Ze’ev was born in Gan Yoshiya and later moved with his family to Tkuma in the south, according to a kibbutz eulogy.\nThe couple met while they were both working on Kibbutz Na’aran in the Jordan Valley, and fell rapidly in love, marrying not long after in 1978 and settling down in Be’eri, where their three children were born. Zehava worked in many jobs on the kibbutz, including at the printing house and in education. Ze’ev spent years as the kibbutz’s head of agriculture, where he helped grow potatoes, wheat, peanuts, corn, peas and gladioli until his retirement at age 70.\nZehava’s friend, Naomi Ilan, wrote online about how, “from a difficult and lonely childhood, you built yourself with your own two hands. Your strengths as a person, as a woman, always inspired endless admiration in me.”\n“You built a good and supportive relationship with Ze’ev and you later taught yourself to be a mom, your children blossomed and were blessed with a loving, warm and supportive family. Later of course you were also a wonderful grandmother to your grandchildren. You were an optimistic, cheerful woman, who radiated kindness to those around you.”\nIn a eulogy written by Be’eri’s agricultural branch, Ze’ev was remembered for his decades of working “with endless professionalism” in the wheat fields and later with potatoes.\n“You became a professional, an autodidact” whose studies included a trip to Australia to learn new techniques. “You always loved the quiet work out in the field, you didn’t speak much, a quiet and modest man, a dedicated family man who loved his children, Zehava and his grandchildren.”\nTheir son, Hagay, wrote on Facebook in April about the “first wheat season without Dad.”\n“In a past life, in this season, Dad would already be running around the field after every harvester and combine, checking and making sure not a single grain was left in the field,” he wrote. “This is the first season that you weren’t by my side, from preparing the fields to sowing until the harvest… Sadly this year we sowed with tears and sadness and we also harvested with tears and sadness.”\n“Everyone who knew you couldn’t help but shed a tear in the field, but you should know that we still sowed and harvested,” he added. “Mom and Dad, I hope you can see the harvested wheat fields from above. This year I dedicate the wheat season to you. I love you and miss you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Maj. Mordechay (Moti) Shamir, 29, an officer in the Golani Reconnaissance Unit, from the West Bank settlement of Yakir, was killed on October 7 while battling Hamas in Kibbutz Re’im.\nDuring the time of the attack, Moti, a career army officer, was engaged in university studies as part of his IDF service. He was at home when the Hamas invasion began, but as soon as he heard about what was happening he immediately headed south to join the fight.\nHe joined up with a group of soldiers from Golani’s 51st Battalion near Ofakim, and “Moti took control of the forces” in the area, according to an officer on the scene that day. “For about two hours we fought at the junction until other forces showed up.”\nThen Moti and five others headed toward Kibbutz Rei’m, where they were immediately greeted by gunfire upon entering. During the gunfight, Moti got shrapnel in his eye and a bullet in his shoulder, but tied up the wound himself and kept going, the officer said. Not long after, a terrorist opened fire from behind and shot Moti several times in the back, and he was declared dead during the fighting — two weeks before his 30th birthday.\nHe was buried on October 10 in Elkana. He is survived by his wife, Revital, their son, Lavi, 4, his parents, Esther and Benzion, and his sisters, Zehavit and Noa. His daughter, Ori, was born several months after he was killed.\nMoti joined the army in 2013 and signed on as a career officer following the end of his mandatory service. He and Revital met when they were both serving in the army, and got married in 2016. In 2021 he began studies at Ariel University under the aegis of the army. During that time Moti and Revital tried several rounds of IVF to have another child, and also had a miscarriage, before finding out in June that she was pregnant.\nAt his funeral, former education minister Shai Piron, Moti’s former teacher, said he was “not the student we thought would become a warrior. Time and time again you would carry out a prank, accompanied by gentle laughter. We had many conversations… and toward the end of the high school, you picked yourself up, you made yourself anew. You taught all of us what willpower was.”\n“You taught us all the power of control and choice, personal responsibility, growth,” added Piron. “Moti the leader, Moti the hero didn’t give up on the laughter, didn’t stop making us happy… you were a model of kindness and friendship.”\nRevital told Ynet that on October 7, when Moti left the house, despite not having an active formal role in the army or being called up, “I had no fear or worry. Nobody could beat Moti, and he went to do what was necessary and to fight.”\nRevital said the couple had hoped and waited for their second pregnancy for several years, “and we found out on our anniversary and it was the biggest gift. The pregnancy gave me strength and caused me to hold on to life” after Moti was killed. “I felt that Moti was inside me and it was true.” Ori was born in February, four months after Moti was killed.\nRevital said that Lavi is “always trying to understand what it means and why I’m always crying. He wakes up in the morning and the first thing he asks is, ‘Where’s Dad?’ I am sure that Moti is watching over us, it would be just like him. He was always the first to run ahead.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Tomer Dolev (Dabul), 34, a soldier with the Home Front Command, was killed on October 8 while fighting Hamas next to Netiv Ha’asara.\nTomer was on vacation in the Sinai when the Hamas invasion began on October 7, and he was called up to reserve duty, immediately heading back to Israel. On the second day of fighting, he was killed by accidental friendly fire following a mistaken identification amid the ongoing battle against the thousands of terrorists who had infiltrated southern Israel.\nHe was buried in Ashkelon on October 12. He is survived by his parents, Etti and Nissim, and his siblings Noy, Sapir, Toni, Harel and Almog.\nTomer worked as a sales manager for an office furniture company. He had just moved to a new apartment in Sde Hemed from Ramat Gan a few days before he went to travel in Sinai during the holiday period.\nHis family said that most of his belongings had yet to be unpacked, and his television had not been hooked up — but they weren’t surprised he had taken off for a trip in the middle of unpacking. Tomer traveled almost nonstop, his family said, including five months in India after he completed his mandatory army service — and more recent trips back to the country. He loved to ride motorcycles and participate in extreme sports during his travels.\nHis brother-in-law, Niv, wrote on Facebook that Tomer “enjoyed life and traveled at every opportunity.

I love you forever and I will always remember you.”\nHis sister, Toni, told Channel 13 news that Tomer “was loved by everyone — really, I know everyone says that but it’s really true.”\n“People have been calling and saying that what they most remember from him is his smile,” said Toni. “He was always very witty, and unique, a chiller, optimistic, he loved Israel, he traveled a lot, he lived his life in the best way you could imagine.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

When the rocket fire began, the pair tried to flee the site of the rave in their car and were shot dead by terrorists lying in wait on the side of the road.\nLibby was able to call her family after she had already been mortally wounded and explained to them the situation. After she told them that she loved them, she was murdered in a volley of shots that the family heard in the call.\nShe is survived by her mother, twin brother, and younger sister.\nHer mother Shelly Meshel-Yogev described Libby to Channel 12 as “the happiest person this world has ever known.

    "story": "Sgt. Maj. (res.) Mark Kononovich, 35, of the Gaza Division’s 8208 reserves battalion, was killed in Khan Younis on January 22 along with 20 other reserves soldiers as buildings they were securing for demolishment collapsed following multiple explosions.\nKononovich was born in Nizhny Tagil, an industrial city in the Ural region of Russia, and raised in Carmiel.\nJust 10 days before the October 7 Hamas onslaught, Kononovich celebrated the birth of his second daughter, Noya, his fourth child. Immediately after the terrorists invaded from Gaza, he packed his bags, said a late-night goodbye to his mother — who had just arrived from Russia to visit — and headed south.\nA professional security officer and experienced soldier, Kononovich participated in every operation in the Gaza sector since 2011. Despite pleas from friends to avoid combat after his third child was born, Kononovich was resolute: “If everyone did that, what then? I’m not just a father; I refuse to hide behind my children,” he would say.\nKononovich’s life was marked by determination. Afflicted with a speech impediment as a child, he conquered it through sheer will, repeating his name hundreds of times a day until he could pronounce it perfectly.\nAfter his parents divorced, Kononovich immigrated to Israel with his father in 1999. Despite being eligible to avoid combat service as an only child, he chose to join the Givati Brigade as a sniper. After his military service, he lived briefly with his father in Carmiel before moving to Eilat.\nThere, he met his future wife, Orel, at a local party and soon started a family. Kononovich’s friend, IT specialist David Baskin, recalls, “Mark was thin but fit, with a bold post-army attitude. We hit the gym together, partied at clubs, and he was always the life of the party.”\nKononovich spent every available moment with his children, ensuring they learned about their Russian heritage and their grandmother living in Russia.\n“He introduced his eldest, Michael, to sports and was proud of his children’s artistic talents,” said Emil Izyaguev, who has been friends with Kononovich since their time in the army.\nThough get-togethers weren’t as frequent as he would have liked due to the demands of family and professional life, Kononovich’s life was largely dedicated to others. “He lived minimally for himself, with his only personal indulgence being the occasional PlayStation game,” said Baskin.\nOn the day before the tragedy that killed Kononovich, а fellow reservist expressed distress over not having been home for an extended period. Kononovich was supportive and sympathetic, and helped obtain a furlough pass for the soldier. Unknowingly, this simple act of helping a friend return home for a brief respite spared his life from the impending disaster that would strike the next day. Kononovich’s everyday actions of support and care subtly shaped the lives around him.\nKononovich was buried on January 24 in Herzliya. He is survived by his wife, Orel, their four children, Tair, Michael, Yehonatan and Noya, as well as his parents, Alexander and Alevtina, and his siblings Evgenia and Daniel.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

As a counselor, she knew how to speak with students at eye level, and lead them to success with a sense of security that they had a support system behind them.”\nAfter her retirement, Rotem spent a lot of time volunteering, including at a center for victims of sexual assault as well as an organization for IDF veterans with PTSD.\nHer friend and former colleague, Varda Ben Bassat, told Israel Hayom that they first met in the 90s while teaching physical education at the same school.\n“Rotem was a person who loves people,” she said. “She loves people, teens, kids, she always made sure to relate to her students on their level, and she was like a mom, dad, sister and counselor figure to them.

Doctors were unable to save him, and his family asked that his organs be donated, and his liver, lungs and kidneys saved five lives, including a 8-year-old boy.\nHe was buried on October 12 on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. He is survived by his parents, Batya and Yishai, and his seven siblings, David, Odaya, Amiya, Yedidya, Oz, Eitan and Yair.\nAfter finishing high school, Amichay spent four years studying at a yeshiva in Petah Tikva before enlisting in Golani at age 22.\nAccording to a memorial site set up by his family, Amichay was “real, opinionated, stubborn and tough, he wasn’t afraid to stand by his beliefs. He was a man of truth and justice, but he also knew how to be sensitive to them. In conversations with friends, he gave them his full attention… always with great humility.”\nHis former teacher, Rabbi Avraham Seidman, described Amichay as “a sweet and humble guy, with a unique glow in his face… he always exhibited joy and vitality. In the beit midrash he was as gentle as a worm, and on the battlefield he was as tough as wood. A hero in the war of Torah and a hero in the war to protect the people and the land.”\nAmichay’s sister, Amiya, told Channel 14 that I “really admired him, I really built myself on his path.” Another sister, Odaya, said that “he’s my younger brother but I learned so much from him, and I’m taking so much from him with me in my life. My children are little so I don’t know what they will remember, but they will always know who he was.”\nHis mother Batya said Amichay was “sweet, full of life, with a good heart, on the one hand, but a great deal of stubbornness, on the other hand… his kindness spread to everyone around him.”\nAmichay’s father, Yishai, told Channel 12 news that the decision to donate his organs after his death fit in perfectly with the way he lived his life: “Amichay totally deserved to keep doing good, his whole life was that way — that was Amichay, he did good in his whole life to everyone, there’s nobody who could say he bothered them, the opposite. He was so good to everyone around him, to his friends, his siblings, to us, his parents. That’s what really helped us make the decision.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Erez Mishlovsky, 20, a Givati Brigade soldier from Oranit, was killed fighting in northern Gaza on October 31.\nErez was one of 11 soldiers from the Givati Infantry Brigade’s Tzabar Battalion who were killed on the same day when a Namer armored personnel carrier they were in was hit by an anti-tank guided missile fired by Hamas, the IDF said — including Staff Sgt. Adi Danan, Staff Sgt. Itay Yehuda and Lt. Pedayah Mark.\nHe was buried on November 2 in Tel Aviv. He is survived by his parents, Sophie and Yariv, siblings Guy, Aayah and Noa, and his girlfriend, Eden.\nIn a charred letter to his loved ones found on his body after his death, Erez wrote: “Hi.

Who could imagine that the moment would come that I would be entering Gaza as a soldier… when I was a kid, you always protected me. Now is my turn to protect you.”\nA photo of members of the Givati Infantry Brigade’s Tzabar Battalion, showing many of those killed in Gaza on October 31, 2023.

His favorite food was spaghetti bolognese, which he always craved when he was home on breaks from the army.\nHis girlfriend, Eden, who enlisted in the army not long after he was killed, told Ynet that “I always said he was a hero and a champion and to watch out for himself. Erez was always the brainy one, he had a huge heart. He would always tell his friends to make the right choices and he was there for others. I will take that with me into my service. He was very introverted, but his personality burrowed deep into people. He will always be in my heart.”\nOn the day that Erez was slated to be released from his military service, his mother, Sophie, wrote to him in an Instagram post.\n“Our hero son, today you were supposed to be released and to once again become a civilian,” she wrote. “There were plans and there was talk about what you would do the day after… I planned to take a sabbatical and spend some of the time with you. But fate decided otherwise, and you’re not here!”\nSophie wrote that her pain and grief was all encompassing, but accompanied by pride: “Every path you chose, all the courage you showed and all the loyalty, brotherhood, and faith in the cause for which we went to war. My dear son, we will learn to grow from the pain, be strong, and continue to memorialize you and your journey. The way of Erez — the strength, the power, quietly and humbly.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Igor Kurtser, 73, from Ofakim, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in Sderot on October 7.\nIgor was one of 13 people aboard a minibus of senior citizens heading for a day trip to the Dead Sea who were slain that day. The bus got a flat tire next to Sderot and stopped next to a bus stop in the city to try and fix it. While they were standing there, sirens began to ring out, and the shelter at the bus stop, which was supposed to electronically unlock, did not, and remained inaccessible.\nIn an photo taken minutes before his death, Igor, wearing a white shirt and a blue baseball hat with sunglasses around his neck and crocs on his feet, can be seen trying to open the door of the shelter. Moments later, a pick-up truck of terrorists drove by and shot dead all 13 travelers. Only the driver emerged alive.\nImages of the group of pensioners lying dead at the bus stop were among the first to circulate on the morning of the Hamas onslaught, shocking Israelis and the world with the brutality of the assault.\nIgor was buried in Ofakim on October 9. He is survived by his three children, Victor, Alex and Lena, and three grandchildren.\nBorn and raised in Mazyr, Belarus, Igor served in the Soviet army in an anti-aircraft warfare unit, according to a eulogy on the Ofakim municipal website. He studied carpentry, later working in a refinery and number of other factories. In 1973, he married Berta and the couple had three children.\nAll of the kids moved to Israel of their own accord over the years, and in 1997 Igor and Berta followed and settled in Ofakim, where he worked as a healthcare aide until his retirement. The couple later divorced.\nHis daughter, Lena, told a Kan podcast that her father grew up in a home of Holocaust survivors “and grew up on Holocaust stories, which he also passed on to us.”\nSeeing how he was killed, she said, evoked the Holocaust for her: “They just shot them like in the Holocaust at point-blank range, this whole group of old people.”\nHe may have been 73, she said, “but he was young and healthy and he loved life, in particular living in Israel. He loved to take part in organized trips, he went on a lot of trips, and to a lot of shows. And he was killed on one of those trips.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

All three were murdered in the Hamas attack along the beach.\nIn a final voice note sent just before his death published by Channel 12, Tal said, “You won’t believe it, we’re seeing rockets exploding in the water right before our eyes, five meters from us, rockets flying in the sky, boats fighting other boats, it’s insane, I’ve never seen anything like this.”\nHis family searched for him for hours, tracking his phone to the Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon, eventually tracking the phone down further to the morgue, which was packed with bodies. His grandfather pulled out his phone and called Tal, and the sound rang out in the morgue. The staff was able to identify his body and provide his family with closure that day.\nHis sister shared on Instagram a photo of the three-word note he left behind at home when he set out early that morning: “I went fishing (Tal).”\nTal’s funeral was held on October 18 in Kibbutz Negba, and he was buried in Netiv Ha’asara. He is survived by his parents, Sivan and Alon, and his sisters Shay and Yuval.\nThe Zikim Beach, just a few kilometers away from Netiv Ha’asara, was Tal’s second home, his family said. He loved to surf — including taking trips to the Maldives and Sri Lanka to do so — and went on regular fishing trips with his friends. He also loved to play and watch soccer and was a big fan of Hapoel Beersheba.\nFor the past few years, Tal had worked on Fridays selling flowers from Netiv Ha’asara at the farmer’s market in Tel Aviv next to the port. With what he earned, he would fund his surfing trips.\nTal’s grandfather retired Brig. Gen. Aryeh Keren told a local news site that Tal was “almost always at our house in Ashkelon. He loved to surf and I loved to swim. His surfboard was always on standby at our house.”\nThe pair would head to the beach together, and Tal would surf while his grandfather swam. “We’d spend a lot of time together. And my wife, his grandmother, would always make sure to have lavish meals ready. He was surrounded by our love.”\nA month after he was killed, his sister, Yuval, wrote on an Instagram memorial page, “I miss my little giant brother, I miss the boy with kind and sparkling eyes, the sweet smile, the barely-there mustache and the rosy cheeks.”\n“I miss annoying him, hugging him, kissing him endlessly,” she added. “I miss our jokes and our laughter. I miss Fridays at the port with you, which became our quality time. I miss drinking beer with you and noshing from the barbecue. I miss your energy and your endless vigor… I miss getting up on Saturday morning and photographing you surfing on the beach. It feels like you just flew away for another long surfing trip — and will be back soon. I hope there are some good waves up there above.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

According to a eulogy from Kibbutz Nahal Oz, after Noam met Dikla he decided to settle with her in the kibbutz in 2015.\n“He brought with him a great deal of happiness, joy, songs, light and security to the home, and made Dikla happy,” the eulogy read. “Noam finished renovating their home around two years ago with a big, designed garden that gave hope for a future of many more years of endless love.”\nWriting in April to her father on Instagram, Dafna said, “My father, I miss you so much.”\n“It’s already been 196 days without you,” she wrote. “It’s already been 196 days without hearing your laugh, without seeing your smile in person and not in photos. I love you so much and I keep waiting for you to come to me in a dream so we can speak a little — and I can tell you how much I love and miss you.”\nHis cousin, Nitzan, told Israel Hayom, “Noam Elyakim, my cousin, was a man who was all heart, until his last moments.”\n“Noam was very proud of his work and that he lived in the [Gaza] envelope area and was settling the land,” he added. “He was a man of action, generosity and kindness without limits — and always with modesty and quietly.”\nAfter Noam’s father died a few years ago, “he took his place as the head of the extended family… he united the whole family and was its source of light and hope.”\nAhead of Memorial Day, his brother, Oshri, wrote on Facebook to “my dear brother Noam.”\n“It’s so hard to speak about you in the past tense — every video of you I see, every voice note I listen to, I’m deluding myself that maybe it’s just a bad dream I need to wake up from, and you will show up,” he wrote.\n“You knew how to reach everyone in a personal way, to guide, give good advice and always help,” Oshri added. “Our comfort, Noam, is that your girls Dafna and Ela returned from Hamas captivity, and there is not a day that I don’t thank God for the miracle that they are here. They miss you so much, your loss is so felt, but we will try as much as we can to fill the hole that you left behind.”\nOver the past months, he said, “I have dreamed about you several times, and each time you looked good, smiling like nothing happened.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Sahar Meidani, 20, a Golani soldier from Kiryat Ekron, was killed on October 7 fighting against Hamas at the Nahal Oz IDF outpost.\nEarly that morning, his family said they spoke to him and he told them with some excitement that they were heading out to the border to counter the invasion — not knowing anything of its scope. When they spoke to him again a few hours later, he had been wounded in battle but reassured them he was OK. Around noon his mother said she called him again and someone answered the phone speaking Arabic.\nWhile they were told that Sahar had been taken to a hospital, his family searched for several days for any sign of him before finally being notified that his body had been identified. They were later told that he was killed when the terrorists overran the bomb shelter on the base where he had taken cover with several other wounded soldiers, after refusing opportunities to flee the base.\nA number of his friends were also killed that day, including Staff Sgt. Adir Bogale and Staff Sgt. Ori Karmi.\nSahar was buried on October 12 in Kiryat Ekron. He is survived by his parents, Hila and Liran, and his younger sister Stav.\nLt. Col. Tomer Grinberg, the commander of the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, in which Sahar served, called the fallen soldier’s parents from inside Gaza to tell them that they were fighting in his name, and promising to come and visit the family “and answer all of your questions. We are family forever.” Grinberg was killed fighting in northern Gaza on December 12, before he ever got a chance to visit the Meidani family.\n“Sahar was a wonderful child, pleasant, modest, a boy who spread light everywhere he went, light and happiness,” his mother, Hila, told Channel 14. They were surprised when he pushed to enlist in Golani, she said, because he wasn’t much of an early riser and had trouble sleeping. But he “got through basic training with blood and sweat,” she said. “He experienced difficult things but he never even complained.”\nHis sister, Stav, told the channel that Sahar “was the perfect brother in so many ways… we always knew how to defend each other,” she said. “I’m so proud of him it brings tears to my eyes — he was a hero.”\nHis father, Liran, told Channel 13 news that “Sahar grew up on values of loving the land of Israel, he was a boy that was all good, helped people, nobody came to me in the 20 years he was alive to ever complain about anything he did. Sahar was a moral boy, a gentle boy, he loved this country… he was a hero. He died for the holiness of this land.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Hava Ben Ami, 78, was killed during the Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7.\nHer daughter, Noam Ben Ami Revach, told a British news outlet that she had told her mother to hide in a closet as Hamas terrorists were rampaging through her neighborhood. Around noon, Noam said, Hava texted her: “‘They were just in the house. I’m so terrified.’ And I told her ‘Don’t worry, we’ll be there soon to get you out. I promise we’ll be there soon. Somebody will get you out.'”\nAn hour or so later, they lost contact with her entirely. The family later discovered that the terrorists kidnapped Hava and forced her to the home of Pessi Cohen, where dozens of gunmen were holed up inside with 14 hostages.\nThe terrorists had already killed some of those inside when IDF forces showed up later in the day and engaged in a standoff with the Hamas gunmen. The terrorists used the hostages as a bargaining tool to demand safe passage to Gaza, intending to bring the hostages with them and threatening to kill them if the IDF opened fire. According to the two survivors from inside the house, the terrorists positioned the hostages between themselves and advancing IDF troops as a gun battle blazed.\nOnly one Israeli hostage later emerged alive from the home, in an incident that has been the subject of a highly charged IDF investigation.\nHava was buried on October 18 in Kibbutz Mishmar Hanegev. She is survived by her three children, Amit, Reut and Noam, eight grandchildren — Mai, Gal, Lia, Noa, Hagay, Yael, Romi and Idan — and her sisters, Mazal, Doris and Ronit.\nAccording to a kibbutz eulogy, Hava was born in Aleppo, Syria, with the name Evelyn Yehezkel. In early 1948, amid violence and unrest in the period before the establishment of the State of Israel, she fled with her family on foot toward Israel.\nThe family settled first in Holon, and Hava was later sent as a child to Be’eri to get an education after her mother remarried. There she was unofficially adopted by a family, and remained there for close to 70 years. During that time, Hava worked in many different jobs in the kibbutz, the eulogy read, including the chicken coop, education, the clothing store — before at age 45 she decided to seek out a new path and became a cosmetician.\nShe had a musical ear, singing at ceremonies and celebrations, and knew how to play the accordion, the piano and the flute. In her later years, she took up a number of sports, including pilates, swimming, bike riding and yoga.\nHer grandson, Gal Yelland, introduced a musical interlude at her funeral, noting that with loss, “we live not just with the memories they leave behind, but we memorialize their spirit in every basic thing they taught us — language, food they made for us — or of course, music.”\nOn Hava’s 78th birthday six months earlier, he said, “I came to visit you in Be’eri and we listened together a song you learned to play on the flute once,” a musical tribute that “symbolizes who Grandma Hava was and always will be: full of life and joy.”\nHer daughter, Noam, wrote to “my beloved mother, my best friend, my inspiration, my strength, my support.”\nHava was “the most loving grandmother, most embracing. Every visit the kids were overjoyed — they wanted to wake you up in the morning, you would welcome them with a huge smile and a loving heart. You would show up for us anytime we asked, and even when we didn’t.”\nShe would “spread smiles, optimism, hugs and love in every place. So sensitive, so gentle, with such a big heart. At the age of 78 you had the energy of a 20-year-old.”\nHava’s daughter, Reut, shared online what she read at a Memorial Day ceremony for her mother.\n“My mother, a woman full of vitality with a big heart and a pure soul, loved classical music and music in general, she played the flute with great talent,” noted Reut, recalling her musical participation in many events.\n“Mom had a warm and inviting home, she loved to take care of her plants and work in her beautiful garden, she loved to knit and create and in later years she knitted dolls for toddlers,” added Reut. “Above all, my mother loved her family, she was a devoted mother and grandmother to her children and grandchildren. She developed a unique relationship with every one of her grandchildren. She loved to spoil everyone and give from herself as much as she could with love and endless generosity.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

There, his family said, they succeeded in preventing a larger attack on the moshav by killing a number of terrorists.\nLater, the troops headed back toward Zikim Beach, where many Hamas gunmen had infiltrated Israel. Along the way, Itay was killed in a shootout in which his soldiers were vastly outmanned by the invading terrorists.\nHe was slain alongside two of his soldiers: Sgt. Uri Locker and Sgt. Amit Tsur, and two others — Staff Sgt. Ofir Zioni and Sgt. Dvir Lisha — were killed nearby that day.\nItay is survived by his parents, Smadar and Ilan, and his three younger siblings Liav, 21, Nehoray, 18 and Yonatan, 15. He was buried on October 9 in Rosh Haayin.\nBefore his enlistment, Itay studied in a yeshiva in Givat Shmuel and then in the Otzem pre-army academy in Naveh. Just a week before he was killed, Itay spent the beginning of the Sukkot holiday with his family in Eilat. It was the last time they all saw him.\nHis father, Ilan, told a local news site that Itay “was a man of Torah and of work, he loved the land of Israel, he loved hiking in nature and loved his family. He always knew how to bring his siblings together.” The four brothers would regularly go out on hikes together.\n“Anytime he would come home for Shabbat, he would say to his brothers, ‘Let’s sit together and talk.’ They enjoyed going to the springs to drink coffee or to ride with them on bikes, to stay in touch with them, to listen to them and give them tips,” said Ilan.\nIn a meeting between the families of the fallen soldiers in Itay’s platoon, his mother, Smadar, told Ynet that “it was really important for me to connect between the families. I felt like it was the last wishes of my son Itay.”\nIn a notebook she found after his death, Smadar said that Itay wrote, “‘Bereaved families are with us forever.’ I have no doubt that if he would have survived the fighting, the first thing he would have done was to make contact with the families of the fallen and to embrace them as much as possible.”\n“Itay was modest, humble and happy, a man of Torah and work. He spoke little and did a lot,” his mother added. “The value of family was chief in his eyes, and his siblings were always at the forefront.”\nHe could always be found with his portable gas burner to make Turkish coffee, she said, which became a symbol “of his unique relationships with his parents, siblings, relatives, friends and comrades.” Spending time in nature with Itay and his coffee maker “constituted magical moments of connection, acceptance and listening. Love of Torah and love of the land were rooted in his heart.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Cpt. Amitay Zvi Granot, 24, a commander in the 7th Armored Brigade, from Tel Aviv, was killed on October 15 in a Hezbollah missile strike.\nAmitay was struck and killed by an anti-tank guided missile fired from Lebanon at an IDF outpost in the north.\nHe was buried on October 16 on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. He is survived by his fiance Roni, his parents, Avivit and Tamir, and his siblings Halel, Tama, Yehuda, Eliya, Hadar and Chana.\nHis family said Amitay loved to always be out in nature, at springs and streams, especially as he struggled in school. He was diagnosed with dysgraphia, completing his high school matriculation exams orally, but began to write and express himself during his years in yeshiva. He was also a talented piano player, his family said, and would arrive home from the army, drop his belongings on the floor and immediately start playing.\nTwo weeks before he was killed, he and Roni got engaged, and were planning their wedding for a few months later. With the start of the war on October 7, the couple decided that they would simply get married the next time Amitay had a break from the army — but they never managed that either.\nHis older sister, Halel, wrote on Instagram ahead of Memorial Day that she wasn’t sure how to memorialize Amitay, “but in my heart you have already taken hold.”\n“You are present in my conversations with myself, you are part of the decisions I make, the things I try to understand,” she wrote. “I feel you with me and I believe that you are here.” During the shiva mourning period, she said, the family heard “what we already knew — how wonderful you were, how calm, sure of yourself, how you achieved what you wanted and did what you believed.”\nAll that, she said, despite his struggles over the years in school and at home, “I remember you searching for your place, fighting for it… but I think you didn’t allow external things to control you. You chose your place for yourself, without outside voices, without bells and whistles.” He was controlled only by “an inner truth. I learned from you how to listen, and to be honest, to set yourself in the place that is right and good for you, to not get confused and to not give up.”\nAmitay’s father, Rabbi Tamir Granot, the head of the Orot Shaul hesder yeshiva in Tel Aviv, said at his funeral that for “24 years and four months he only created light, all of his life he created light, everyone who knew him knew that it’s not a cliche. His face, his heart and every fiber of his being were filled with light. Light and light and light.”\nHis mother, Avivit, told Channel 14 that he was, like his name, “a man of truth, the truth was very important to him.”\nAvivit went on to read from his journal, where he wrote that “the people of Israel are not afraid of anything. And even if we’re at the lowest place, without faith, where everything is superficial, there too God is with us, and we are still his people, and nothing can take down the Jewish people.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

His family continued to search for any sign of him for five days before they were able to locate and identify his body.\nHis funeral was held on October 18 in Kibbutz Negba.

You were a role model for me as a cyclist and as a person with a huge and wonderful heart.”\nHaim’s brother-in-law, Shahar Berger, wrote on Facebook to “my dear and beloved brother-in-law.”\n“You were such an optimistic person,” he wrote. “Every Friday night dinner with the extended family you would raise your hands in the air and say, ‘What fun it is that we’re all together.'”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Shay Uriel Pizem, 23, a tank commander in the 401st Armored Brigade’s Ninth Battalion from Ein HaNatziv, was killed on December 15, 2023, while battling Hamas terrorists in southern Gaza.\nShay was killed when a balcony collapsed on his tank during a nighttime operation in Khan Younis.\nHe was slain three weeks after the birth of his first child. He is survived by his widow Maayan and baby Yarden, parents Carmit and Shimon, siblings Re’em, Adva and Tzuri.\n“With all the grief over your passing, my dear Shay, we still must give thanks for all the good we had from you,” Shimon said, speaking at Shay’s funeral.\n“Every part of your life was to us like a whole person filled with good,” said his father.\nCarmit told Army Radio that from an early age, Shay was “active and always looking for challenges.”\n“He knew how to take advantage of every moment. He had an ideology in which he believed that real joy came from working hard and reaching your goals,” said his mother.\nShay and Maayan grew up together in Ein HaNatziv.\n“Everyone always laughed at us. They would say ‘Shay and Maayan will get married first’ and ‘Shay and Maayan will get married at 18,'” she told Kan.\nShay left reserve duty to be present at Yarden’s birth and spent two weeks with her and Maayan before going back to the war.\n“He was always a happy person, but during those first days with Yarden, he was happier than I’d ever seen him. He was head over heels in love with that girl. As short as it was, it felt like a long time,” Maayan said.\nWhen he left for the last time, Maayan asked him if it was hard for him to say goodbye to Yarden and he replied, “No, because now I know more than ever what I’m fighting for.”\n“We’ll tell Yarden that he was a hero, but not a hero like in the movies. He was a normal person who always fought to stay humble,” Maayan told Ynet.\n“I’ll especially tell her that he loved her most in the world, that he had the most wonderful two weeks with her, that she was his greatest pride, and that he had never loved in his life like he loved her and was never more excited than he was with her,” said his wife.\nShay studied at the yeshiva in Har Etzion and also helped establish a religious boarding school in Har Etzion.\n“In all his 23 years, Shay was a leading and valued character, a smart, talented, serious, and idealistic student, but still happy and social with a sharp sense of humor,” said Rabbi Amnon Bazak who teaches in the yeshiva.\nThe boarding school’s principal, Rabbi Amichai Gordin, told Israel Hayom that Shay’s contribution to the school was “dramatic.”\n“He was a rare man of education. He was very pleasant and had a superior ability to reach people. It’s rare that you can say about a 23-year-old that he was one of the main establishers and an essential part of a yeshiva,” he said.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

When the rocket fire started, the three left for their car and had reached the Mefalsim junction when Shahar was shot by Hamas terrorists, and the car flipped.\nSharon called her brother Eli in a panic. He immediately set out to try and help her, although when Sharon realized how many terrorists were lying in wait, she told him to turn back but he didn’t listen, their family said. When he neared the junction, he was shot by a cell of terrorists, and the family believes Sharon was on the phone with him at the time and heard the gunfire.\nHer mother said she later spoke to her on the phone as she was trying desperately to escape alive: “Sharon said she was sorry she called Eli… ‘Sorry I ruined your life, we’re going to try and escape but I don’t know if I’ll make it out,'” she said on the call. That was the last her family heard from her. Shahar and Oriya were also both killed that day.\nAfter several days, the Refai family was informed that Sharon’s body had been identified, and she was buried on October 12 in Yavne. Several days later, Eli’s body was identified, and he was buried on October 16 alongside her.\nThey are survived by their parents, Metuka and Shlomo, and four other siblings: Livnat, Reut, Liav and Aviel.\nEli worked as a logistics manager for a cosmetics company, while Sharon, who was finishing her studies in information systems, worked for a chain of party goods stores. The siblings were very close, their family said, and after their parents’ divorce, Eli was a father-like figure to Sharon, always worrying about her.\nTheir sister, Reut, told Channel 12 news that Sharon was volunteering with at-risk youth and looking for a steady job, “planning to get married and to build a family, Shahar was the love of her life. Just when she was arriving at a point to reap the benefits, her life was cut short monstrously. We are left heartbroken.”\nTheir older sister, Livnat, told Ynet that Sharon and Shahar had been dating for about a year and had only recently moved in together in Ramat Gan, while planning a joint future: “The day she met Shahar she knew he was the one for her. She introduced him to the family as ‘my future husband,’ and we were so happy for her.”\nLivnat said Eli was the heart of the house, “we could barely ask for something and he was already ready and waiting for us. We wanted him to take care of himself, to build a life and have a family, but he dedicated his whole life to us.” She said that Eli “worried in particular about Sharon, during her final two years as a student she lived with him and he took care of all of her needs.”\nSharon, she said, was a calm, steady influence, and even when she knew she had lost both Eli and Shahar, she stayed calm and warned her other friends at the festival not to come to the same area, saving their lives: “She spoke calmly and in control even in the most difficult and terrifying moments, when her life was in danger, when she just lost the two men who were her whole world,” said Livnat. “That’s how she was her whole life, brave and heroic and in control and taking care of everyone. Always optimistic and believed that the end will be good. But this time it ended in a great tragedy.”\nTheir mother, Metuka said, “Eli always supported me and was by my side through good and bad. A child with a huge soul who never thought about himself, only about others. He raised, taught and supported his three younger siblings… Thanks to him I am standing on my own two feet.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Idan Bloy, 21, a Golani signals officer from Rishon Lezion, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of the Nahal Oz outpost.\nWhen Hamas invaded the IDF outpost, Idan was among the first to race for the war room, but he later left to fight back, shooting at the terrorists while still giving orders over the radio, survivors recounted. He was killed in the firefight.\n“When I got to [the war room] he was already there, doing what he needed to do and more,” recounted Maya Chailovsky. “What’s hard in that situation is to stay in command, be in control, stay calm — and he had it all at 200%.”\nHis family was only informed four days later that he had been killed. Idan was buried on October 12 in Holon. He is survived by his parents, Ravit and Alex, his younger sisters, Ariel and Yahli, and his girlfriend, Lihi Shamsian.\nIdan was a huge fan of the Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team, and star player Eran Zahavi shared a photo of him taken with the young fan more than a decade earlier, writing that the fallen soldier “was a Maccabi fan from the day he was born.”\nIn a video published by the IDF’s Computer Service Directorate, Tomer Bargon, who served under Idan, said from the moment they met he realized he was “a cut above the rest, with incomparable professionalism, with command capabilities, and a desire to give of himself and to work for the country, for the IDF companies, for the soldiers.”\nHis friend Yahel Shininger wrote in Ynet that Idan was “the best of the best.”\n“I can’t believe that I won’t get a text from you on my birthday that reads just ‘mazel,’ like every year,” she wrote. “That you won’t be any more at picnics and hangouts, that we won’t laugh at our shared jokes. That I won’t see you be released from the army, travel, get married — we went through all these stages together, we grew up together and now I am forced to keep growing without you.”\nGirlfriend, Lihi, told Ynet that the pair met on the day they both enlisted into the army and became a couple four months later, staying together for close to three years.\n“Our relationship was very unique,” she said. “We were together on the same track and we experienced extreme things together. We wanted to travel together and then get married and have kids. We did everything in unison, and it was a huge part of my life.”\nLihi was stationed in the Golan Heights on October 7, and for four days waited to hear news of Idan’s fate. “When they told me, I was still with my battalion. What went through my head was that Idan would expect me to stay and to work and not to leave. I promised him at his funeral that I will stay in the battalion, and do what he would want me to.”\nAt an event in his memory marking what would have been his 22nd birthday, his mother, Ravit, spoke about the times when she “holds on to small comforts.”\n“The magic of the boy you were, your good life, happy, full of purpose, of action, success, friends, you got to experience a pure and true love with Lihi,” she said. “At every station in life, you left your mark — as a person, a friend, a commander… Idani loved to celebrate, to mark his birthday, every year with a big and esteemed party, with plenty of music and dancing and drinks — and we will continue this tradition.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Shachar Aviani, 56, the head of the Kibbutz Kfar Aza local security team, was killed battling the Hamas invasion of the kibbutz on October 7.\nWith the start of the attack, Shachar headed to the kibbutz’s weapons locker, and called up the rest of the local security team with the warning: “This is not a drill, I repeat, this is not a drill, there are terrorists in the kibbutz.”\nBut the area surrounding the weapons arsenal was already beset by terrorists, and he and other members of the small security team fought back against dozens of them, with seven of them ultimately killed that day: Tal Eilon, Aviv Baram, Uri Russo, Ofir Libstein, Nadav Amikam and Avi Hindi.\nShachar was posthumously recognized as a fallen soldier with the rank of sergeant major in the reserves.\nHe was buried in Kibbutz Shefayim on October 19. He is survived by his wife, Sharon, their four children, Li-hi, 29, Yonatan, 26, Shaili, 20, and Gili, 17, his parents, Sarah and Asher, and his siblings Sharon and Sahar.\nIn 2018, Shachar spoke to the Globes news outlet amid a spate of arson kite attacks from Gaza, aimed at setting fields in the area on fire. He told the site that the damage was upsetting, “but let’s not forget an important thing, it’s just a kite. It’s not exact, it’s not strong, it can’t go that far.”\n“Whatever comes, we’ll deal with it,” he added at the time. “In the meantime our focus is on the 60th celebration of the kibbutz this week. We’re continuing to live, to grow, to expand.”\nHe had served as the kibbutz security chief since 2017, and was deeply devoted to the community. He loved music, although his family said he couldn’t carry a tune, he was a steadfast Maccabi Tel Aviv fan and brewed his own line of beers.\nShachar and Sharon met in 1989 while they were both traveling in South America — a trip Sharon took a few years after her older brother, Yaron, was killed during his army service. The couple married in 1991 and settled in the kibbutz, where she was born and raised.\nHis youngest daughter, Gili, told La’Isha magazine that her father was “a man of the land even though he grew up in a city… he loved agriculture. He was a Zionist, loved the country.” Even before he moved to the kibbutz, she said, he pursued that path, attending an agricultural high school and working with livestock.\nIn his memory, she said, she tattooed an image of a sheep representing his love for animals, as well as the classic Yehonatan Geffen children’s album, “The Sixteenth Lamb.” Anytime he would return from a security incident in the kibbutz, she said, “I would recite a line from the album: ‘Many kids say that their fathers are heroes.'”\nShachar’s daughter, Shaili, wrote in Ynet that “my father was a happy and optimistic man.”\n“He would always tell me, ‘Take life easy. life is simple, we’re the ones who complicate it,'” she recalled. “My father gave all the residents of the kibbutz a sense of security. If I had a shekel for every time I heard from someone in Kfar Aza the sentence: ‘Your father gives us confidence and we feel protected because of him,’ or, ‘We tell our children that Shachar is watching over them, and they feel safe and unafraid’ — I would already be a millionaire.”\nHer father’s motto, she wrote, was “‘Do good, and the good will come back to you’… he believed that if someone spreads goodness, he will get it in return. He believed in that sentence so much that on that Saturday he didn’t think twice before leaving his house for a kibbutz teeming with terrorists. He protected us with his body, not just our family but the entire community.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Shai Shalev, 50, from Ahuzat Barak, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nShai was at the rave as part of the security detail, and his wife, Eilat, joined him overnight. When the rocket fire began, the two headed for their car to try and leave, but got stuck in the traffic along Route 232, where Hamas terrorists were slaughtering motorists. They decided to turn around and head back toward the festival, where they ended up getting separated.\nEilat managed somehow to survive and escape after being shot at multiple times and hiding in an orchard for hours. Shai returned to the rave’s security headquarters, believing that the army would be showing up soon. He sent farewell messages to his children, believing that Eilat had already been killed, and was in the midst of sending another message when Hamas terrorists entered the tent he was in and opened fire, killing him.\nHis last message in the family WhatsApp group came through at 9:09 a.m.: “They’re shooting at us from every direction, take care of yourselves kids, I lost contact with Mom.” His body was identified five days later.\nShai was buried on October 15 in Ahuzat Barak. He is survived by his wife, Eilat, their four children, Shaked, 23, Noy, 21, Gefen, 17 and Stav, 11, as well as his mother, Chana, sister Merav and brother Tomer. He is predeceased by his father, Amos, and older brother, Ram.\nDuring his army service, he was in a bad motorcycle accident that required extensive rehab, and it got him into sports and working out, including swimming. He worked in management but always dreamed of becoming a DJ, his family said.\nEilat told Channel 12 news that in recent years Shai had gotten deep into the trance music scene: “Shai was very connected to that world, we knew a lot of people from production, we went to festivals abroad. Shai’s dream was to establish a production line of festivals, he had a Facebook group called ‘Step Trance’ with many followers, I believe if he were still alive he would accomplish that dream.”\nShe said that her husband “was 50 years old but he acted like he was 30. The kids sought his advice on everything, parties, relationships, he always knew how to guide and advise them. He was a supportive husband. Shai was my best friend before he was my husband. We knew everything about each other, there was a huge openness between us, everyone who knew him loved him, 20-year-olds admired him — he was a friend to everyone.”\nHis daughter, Noy, wrote on Instagram: “My father, Dad you were everything to me, the best person I know, you always worried about us and took care of us.”\n“You’re the strongest and best person I know,” she continued. “I didn’t believe that this could happen to you of all people… My father will never come back to me. I still can’t come to terms with it and don’t know what we’ll do now without you. Who will take me everywhere I ask? Who will take care of me the way you did? Who will do for me what you did?… I promise to look after the whole family as you asked me to in your final moment.”\nHis oldest daughter, Shaked, wrote on Instagram: “My beautiful father, the handsome, the talented, my best friend.”\n“What wouldn’t I tell you? What I ate, what I said, who I was with, what I did, what to do,” she wrote. “We never had secrets between us, I would tell you everything even when you didn’t want to hear it, because that’s how you were. A father that allowed everything, but at the same time didn’t let go and always took care of every little thing for me, and made sure I was lacking nothing.”\n“I know you wanted to live, you loved to live, you loved to go out and party with Mom, to go to the beach on Saturdays, to have a fun day out with us kids, to come with me to Tel Aviv to sit and talk or just to be at home with the family,” Shaked continued. “I know you wanted to be here with us when we grew up, get married, have kids, I know. But a horrible tragedy befell us and caused that not to happen.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Amit Esther Buskila, 27, from Ashdod, was murdered by Hamas terrorists near the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHer body was taken captive by Hamas to the Gaza Strip, where it remained until it was recovered by IDF troops in an operation in northern Gaza on May 17.\nAmit was on the phone with her uncle, Shimon, during the early morning hours of the attack. She told him that she could hear terrorists approaching as she was hiding behind cars near the Mefalsim junction, where she had fled from the site of the rave.\nShimon then heard her begging and the last words he heard her say were, “No, no, no,” and then, in a weak voice, “I love you.”\nAmit was laid to rest in Kiryat Gat on May 19. She is survived by her parents, Ilana and Meir, and her brother, Siel.\nAmit, a budding fashion stylist, was remembered by her loved ones for her fun-loving sense of humor, love of cooking and her dream of one day being famous. Not long before she was killed, Amit filmed an audition for the reality TV show “Master Chef,” but her family asked for it to not be included in the show while her fate was unknown.\nHer close friend, Eden Wessely, wrote on Instagram after news of her death to “my angel, you just went out to dance and never came home.”\nFor seven months she had hoped that “Amit returned and I would tell her everything that happened when she wasn’t here, and her with her humor would make everything light-hearted and laugh at all the photos of her that I hung in every corner of my house.”\nEden noted that the pair had been friends for more than 15 years. “What didn’t we go through together? Ups and downs, tears and laughter… I prayed that you would get married, have children, I always dreamed that we would grow old together, we had a true friendship, through good and bad.”\nAmit’s mother, Ilana Buskila, cried at the funeral: “I prayed for a different ending to the torment I’ve been through,” she said.\n“I was lucky to have you for 28 years,” she continued. “You wrapped me in love, you were my inspiration… you entered the hearts of the people of Israel.”\nAmit’s brother, Siel, said at her funeral that his sister was “the light, the sun that shone everywhere, she was a free bird without borders, without restraints. Everywhere she wanted to go, she went. Every goal she set for herself, she achieved.”\nTheir family, he said, “was amazed time and time again by your courage, your bravery, your faith and your achievements. You are strong as a rock, steadfast and stubborn, only I know what a fighter you are, whenever you were disappointed by those around you I was there to observe from the sidelines, proud of your inner strength.”\nAmit “dreamed of being a huge success, of conquering the world,” he said. “My little sister, my love. Your bed at home is made up and empty. The mirror at home has not reflected your face for some time. The pots at home will no longer feel the warmth of your hands. And the spices will remain in their places. Who will fill the home with food and joy?”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

During his funeral, friends handed out rubber ducks for mourners to place on the gravestone instead of the customary stones that Jewish mourners place on graves to show respect.\nSince Ilai was killed, friends and family have launched a number of social media campaigns to bring people together and submerge in freezing water as a way to memorialize him.\nFriends and family described Ilai as a magnetizing presence, drawing others in with his smiling demeanor.

At 11:10 a.m., all contact was cut off.\nThe couple was considered missing for more than 10 days and thought kidnapped, until the family was informed on October 17 that Noah’s body had been identified, and two days later that Mayana had as well.\nThe couple were buried on October 20 in Kidmat Tzvi in the Golan Heights. They are survived by their three children, Ella, Amit and Tamir, as well as seven grandchildren: Amir, Daniel, Oz, Lavi, Maayan, Raz and Naomi. Noah is also survived by his father, Yosef, and older brother Zion.\nMayana’s mother, Shoshana Karsenty, was also murdered in Be’eri on October 7. Her father, Eli, 93 — who had been captured and held hostage by Egypt on October 7, 1973, and freed after two months — managed to survive the atrocities. Mayana is also survived by a brother, Moti.\nMayana grew up in nearby Kibbutz Ein Hashlosha, and was a prolific artist, teaching art — as well as early childhood and physical education — and expressing herself via painting, drawing, ceramics and photography, according to a kibbutz eulogy.\nNoah was born and raised in Tel Aviv. He fought in both the Yom Kippur and Lebanon wars, and he worked for years in the dairy farm, before getting a degree in structural engineering at age 40 and beginning a new career as an engineer with a company in Sderot.\nThe couple met in 1975 in Kibbutz Kalya on the Dead Sea, where Mayana was doing a year of national service and Noah was part of an IDF youth group tasked with building the kibbutz. They wed three years later, at the end of Mayana’s army service, and settled first in Ein Hashlosha, before moving to Be’eri in 1986, where they remained until their deaths.\nThe pair shared a love for classical music, art and woodworking, sports including swimming and bike riding, and a deep devotion to their children and grandchildren, their family said.\nTheir daughter-in-law, Leeor Rosenberg, shared online the eulogy she read at their funeral. Noah, she wrote, “was not embarrassed to cry, to be emotional, lit up, happy.” She recounted him meeting their granddaughter for the first time, “singing lullabies in a gentle voice, your strong, secure and talented hands, infinitely soft and patient” in holding the newborn. “You knew exactly how to hold, how to embrace, how to care, how to love and to support.”\nMayana, she wrote, “brought art to the center of life’s beating heart. Your ability to interweave your needs, dreams, loves, into a full life — is the art itself.” She was “fully devoted to spending full days with the grandchildren, with endless patience for a game and another game, to travel, to speak on the phone, to advise.” She was dedicated to “caring for your parents, to attending to your children, your friends, your neighbors.” In every area of life, Leeor wrote, Mayana found “time for everything out of a great love for life, inner peace, and incredible dedication to your loved ones. In my eyes, that is art.”\nThe couple’s oldest daughter, Ella, wrote on her own 40th birthday about her parents and the characteristics she inherited from them.\n“From Dad, I received the ability to be exacting, not to be late, to promise and always fulfill that promise,” she wrote. “To rely (mostly) on myself (not always positive) and to go over the same thing 20 times (a little annoying); an obsession with food, to always help others, and kind eyes.”\nFrom her mother, Ella wrote, “I received the ability not to argue and to make peace. To be a manager, to make friends in every place, to be a conversationalist, to always smile broadly, to put on a welcoming face and kind eyes.”\nHer goal, she said, is to continue their path, “to love, to laugh, to create… to dream, to achieve, to succeed, to rise above evil and spread light in the world.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Maj. Ido Israel Shani, 29, the deputy commander of the Nahal reconnaissance unit, from Ramat Gan, was killed on October 7 while battling Hamas terrorists next to Kibbutz Sufa.\nThat morning, Ido was the senior officer in charge of the area between Kerem Shalom and Nir Yitzhak across from the southern end of the Gaza Strip. When the Hamas onslaught began while he was out on patrol, he quickly realized that the situation was exceptional, and broadcast over the army radio connection at 6:43 a.m.: “War, I repeat, we are at war. Everyone must defend his front, kill terrorists, good luck.”\nHe sprang into action, ordering troops to several locations and rousing forces amid the surprise attack. At first he headed to Kerem Shalom, where the families of the observation soldiers stationed there said he saved their lives with his orders. Next, Ido set out for Kibbutz Sufa, and on the way he encountered a cell of terrorists and they engaged in an exchange of fire. He was shot in the head and brought to a nearby kibbutz where he succumbed to his wounds.\n“They were just a few against so many,” his wife, Maayan, told the Kan public broadcaster. “They gave everything to protect this area, and to protect the towns here.”\nShortly before 7 a.m., his wife said, he texted her and said “I love you, everything is OK.” That was the last she heard from him.\nIdo was buried on October 11 in Bnei Zion. He is survived by his wife, Maayan, his parents, Dvora and Tommy, sister Keren and brothers Eilon and Jonathan.\nHe was born in Givatayim and grew up on Moshav Batzra. Ido and Maayan had wed just seven months before he was killed and settled in Ramat Gan. On a memorial site set up for him, his family said that he loved to travel and dance, and was “kind, generous, sociable and loved people. A happy man who loved and knew how to influence others, Ido knew how to speak many languages with many people — he could adjust his language to all that he met.”\nHis aunt, Nurit Kochavi, told Arutz Sheva, “I want to remember Ido the alive, the sweet, smart and sensitive, who was an officer and a gentlemen, and less about the details of how he was killed,” she said. “Ido loved life, loved the army, and paid with his life. That’s our Ido.”\nNurit said Ido was “a man of values, of ethics, integrity and truth. He advanced on the career army ladder, he loved what he did.”\nIdo’s older brother, Eilon, told Kan that he himself had an unpleasant experience during his mandatory army service, “and Ido told me that it was important to him to be a commander so that there won’t be commanders like the ones I had. In many ways I think that even though I was his older brother, he was sort of my older brother.”\nHis father, Tommy, told Kan that after hearing of his actions that day, “we were amazed by his abilities, by his quick understanding of the situation, his peace of mind, his calm.” His mother Dvora said Ido “had a huge smile. He was mischievous and serious, disorganized but responsible… it was just fun to be with him.”\nOn her 30th birthday, Maayan wrote on Facebook about the pain of reaching a milestone that Ido never will.\n“I was so looking forward to reaching this age,” she wrote. “And suddenly it has turned into my first birthday without my Ido… a one-of-a-kind man, sensitive, talented, moral and humane, kind, smart, a leader, brave, funny, loved by all, appreciated and admired.”\n“Thank you for every moment I got to be by your side,” she continued. “I am thankful for the joy he brought into my life and the change he brought about in me, and I am also thankful for the privilege of making him happy in his final years. If only they were not his final years, and if only it was not so short.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Osher Shmaya, 19, a soldier in the Gaza Division, from Beersheba, were killed by Hamas terrorists on October 7.\nOsher was at home on break from the army, and on Saturday morning with the start of the Hamas rocket attack, he decided he needed to head back to his base next to Kibbutz Re’im. His father Kobi agreed to drive him back to the base, and along the way, the pair were both shot dead in their vehicle.\n“I have some comfort that they were killed together because they were found in an embrace,” Evlin Shmaya, Kobi’s wife and Osher’s mother, told La’isha.\nThe family was notified about Osher’s death three days later, but were not informed that Kobi’s body had been identified until a week after the attack. Evlin — who had been told by someone on the scene that they were found together — waited for the news about Kobi so that the father and son could be buried together.\nOsher and Kobi were both buried in Beersheba on October 15. They are survived by their mother/wife Evlin and children/siblings Ofek, 18, and Alyn, 10. Kobi is also survived by his parents, Eliyahu and Chana.\nKobi was a truck driver with a recycling company, and Osher was serving as a cook in the army.\nThe pair were devoted fans of the Hapoel Beersheba soccer team, and Osher himself was a promising player with F.C. Beersheba and received unending support from his father.\nOsher’s coach Moshe Kugman told Sport 5 that he recalled once a game where it was pouring out, and Kobi was just about the only spectator in the stands, “and I turned to him and I said, ‘Kobi, are you crazy? Go home,’ and Kobi said to me, ‘Wherever he goes, I go.'”\nThe family staged a soccer tournament in Beersheba in the pair’s memory.\nOsher’s girlfriend, Bar, told the TV channel that she “still feels like he’s going to open the door and say, ‘Hi sweetie, I’m here.’ But it won’t happen.”\n“He was my first love, he was my first kiss, he was the first guy I brought home,” said Bar.\nIn a letter published on the Mako news site, Ofek wrote to his father, Kobi, that he “had the privilege of growing up with you for 18.5 years, during which you took care of, loved, spoiled, made me laugh, and occasionally got angry.”\n“You will always be my father, and I your son,” he continued. “The job has fallen to me, without me asking for it, to fill the loss of you and Osher. You were the pillar of the house, and Osher, my big brother, a role model to me and to Alyn, and mom’s best friend. And you Dad, are so missed by Mom, but she is a warrior and we are learning to cope.”\nEvlin told a local Beersheba news outlet in December that she misses everything about her husband and son.\n“Their words, their conversations, to hug them, do their laundry, cook for them — I miss their presence,” she said. “I would swap places with Osher if I could… A mother isn’t meant to bury her son,” she added. “I don’t feel like my life is the same life, and every minute without them feels like an eternity.”\nEvlin said that Osher “was a boy that any mother would want, and because he was such a good and handsome boy, such a talented soccer player, I always told him that ‘one day you’ll be famous and people will know about you.’ I didn’t mean it this way. Soccer flowed in Osher’s blood, and Kobi loved soccer at the same level, so much so that Osher started playing soccer at age 5 or 6.”\n“Osher was a kid who everyone loved being around, he never liked arguing, he was always laughing, always happy, respected others, respected his parents, his teachers at school, the army,” Evlin added. “People have only good things to say about this kid, he was my eldest son and he was my best friend.”\nAbout her husband, Evlin said that “there is nobody who would ask for help and Kobi wouldn’t show up first to help. Really, he was one big heart, he did everything for our home, it was important for him to put the house and the kids first, and only afterward himself.

    "story": "Cpt. Yedidya Asher Lev, 26, a deputy company commander in the Givati Brigade’s Shaked Battalion, from Tal Menashe, was killed fighting in the northern Gaza Strip on November 14, 2023.\nHis family said he was part of a mission raiding the Rantisi Hospital in Gaza City, when Hamas gunmen emerged from a tunnel and opened fire, killing Yedidya.\nHe was buried in the settlement of Hinanit on November 15. He is survived by his parents, Orna and Noam, and his seven younger siblings, Talia, Ayelet, Hadas, Achva, Moriel, Matanya and Nahala.\nYedidya attended high school at Yeshivat Shaalvim, and later studied at the Shavei Hevron yeshiva in Hebron for several years before enlisting in Givati. He stayed on past his mandatory service, and was slated to be released several months before he was killed, but was asked by his commanders to stay on in the wake of the war.\nYedidya went through a commander’s course with Sgt. First Class Cedrick Garin, his family said, helping Garin get through the grueling portions of the program and not letting him give up. Garin was killed fighting in Gaza two months after Yedidya.\nHis family said that not long before he was killed, Yedidya donated bone barrow to an ailing 60-year-old woman, after finding out he was a match through the Ezer Mizion registry — an act that brought him great joy. In that spirit, his family also donated his corneas after his death.\nIn conversation with Arutz Sheva, his father Noam recalled how five years earlier Yedidya saved his own life, as they were out playing soccer one night: “I suddenly fell, I had a heart attack. Yedidya regained his composure, called for help and started performing CPR. Those two actions are the actions that gave me my life back.”\nHis younger brother Matanya said that he “wants to learn from you your peace of mind, your love for the Jewish people, your incredible sacrifice and your humor. You were my older brother, my beloved brother, there is none like you. You are a hero.”\nAt his funeral, his mother Orna lamented that “you are no longer with us in this world. We can no longer see you smile, no longer seek your advice, we can’t consult with you, be with you, you were so gentle and sensitive. You were an excellent older brother to your sisters and brother, and a wonderful uncle to your nephew.”\n“My firstborn son, I wish for one more hug. One more kiss on the forehead, one more smile,” she continued. “It’s not normal for parents to bury their son, it’s not normal for siblings to eulogize their brother, it’s not normal for grandparents to bury a grandson, but we are not a normal nation.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Benyamin “Beny” Belay, 20, a driver in the Gaza Division’s Southern Brigade, from Rehovot, was killed on October 7 battling Hamas terrorists at the Kissufim IDF outpost.\nSurvivors said that 19 people on base had piled into the bomb shelter when the rocket fire began, but only five of them were armed, never imagining a Hamas invasion of the base. A number of soldiers were killed in the ensuing gunfire, including Benyamin and several of his comrades.\nHis sister, Oshrat, told a local news site that he called her early that morning and told her of the Hamas infiltration into the base, “and that they were entering the bomb shelter, where he was with his friend. That was my final conversation with him.”\nHis family did not know of his fate until five days later, when they were informed by the military that he had been killed.\nBenyamin was buried on October 13 in Rehovot. He is survived by his parents, Woizero and Fanta, and his siblings Mazal, Oshrat, Maayan and Avior, as well as his girlfriend, Keren Bitao.\nHis friends and family said he was hardworking and devoted to his family, spending his time off-duty from the military working at a local bakery. He planned to take his girlfriend abroad to Prague for her birthday, and dreamed of one day having his own business.\nOn an Instagram memorial page, his loved ones wrote on what would have been his 21st birthday: “You are missed in every moment, your memory accompanies us always.”\n“You were a true friend, brave, you gave your all for the country and its people,” the post continued. “We are proud that we got to know you, all of the experiences we shared are etched onto our hearts.”\nIn a post marking 100 days since he was killed, Beny’s girlfriend Keren said she was struggling with her grief, and “usually it was your job, when I was having a hard time, I would call you and you would always find a way to make me happy.”\n“So at night I speak to you, I know that you hear me and sometimes I even imagine that you answer me,” she continued, writing of their imaginary exchanges. “You would tell me that you would never leave me alone, so I have no doubt that I am not alone and you are with me every moment of the day, listening and watching me.”\nKeren wrote that she knew Beny for around eight years, and they were friends about three years and in a relationship for about a year and a half, “and I saw in that the most beautiful thing in the world, we were the best friends in the world and after that we were lovers. That’s the story we should have been able to tell to every one of the five children we wanted.”\nOne, she added, “I asked you what your biggest dream was, and you answered that it was to take care of your parents. I fell in love with you even deeper,” wrote Keren. “You are the child I would wish for every set of parents to raise and the man I would want for every woman. Thank you for the privilege of being your girlfriend, I love you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Aviv Eliyahu, 38, from Elkosh, was killed by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nAviv was serving as the head of the security of the festival when the attack began that Saturday morning. His younger brother, Yannai, and his cousin’s wife, Shlomi Ziv, were also in attendance at the rave. Yannai managed to survive and Shlomi, who was also working with the security team, was kidnapped by Hamas and rescued by the IDF from Gaza in June — which is when he found out that Aviv had been killed. Another friend, British immigrant Jake Marlowe, was also slain that day.\nYannai told Ynet that when the rocket fire began, “Aviv, my brother, ran to the stage and called over the central microphone to break up the festival and for all the security guards to open the emergency exits and get down on the ground and put their hands on their heads.”\nAviv, his brother added, “was very composed and didn’t express any panic” amid the shock attack. “Without saying goodbye, he went to the parking area to direct traffic” as hundreds started to leave the event. Yannai said that people started coming back from the parking area with gunshot wounds, “and people who were with Aviv told me that they understood it was a terror attack and were firing back at the terrorists and protecting the crowd with their bodies.”\nAviv texted Yannai telling him not to head in the direction of the parking lot, he said. In video footage later received by the family, Aviv can be seen firing back at the terrorists before he is hit and killed by an RPG.\nHe is survived by his wife, Liron, their two sons, Adi, 7, and Nevo, almost 2, his parents, Esther and Sinai and his siblings Moshe, Noam and Yannai.\nAviv was buried on October 15 in Elkosh in the Western Galilee.\nA native of Elkosh and the son of a veteran police officer, Aviv grew up there before enlisting in the IDF for his mandatory service and serving in the Artillery Corps on a base in the south. He later studied at the College for Security Professions where he prepared for his career in security, during which he managed many high-profile and crowded events and gatherings across the country.\nYannai told Ynet that his older brother “was a peace-seeking person who loved the country and all mankind — Arabs, Jews, without differentiating between religion, ethnicity and gender. He was loved and respected and he respected everyone.” Yanai said he thought of Aviv, 15 years his senior, “like a father, he was my guiding force in life, we were very connected. Every little thing I would need, he would always help. I feel like I’ve been abandoned.”\nAviv’s father Sinai, who served as a police officer for 42 years and retired after his son was killed, told Ynet that he “gave Aviv these values of giving as much as possible to others and protecting them, and in the moment of truth, he gave his life and saved thousands by keeping them away from the terrorists and staying behind to fight.”\nMarking 30 days since he was killed, Aviv’s wife, Liron, wrote that he was “the best husband and best friend I could have ever asked for, and the best father there was. Adi was always proud that Dad had a weapon and he could beat everyone but the monstrous terrorists didn’t leave you a chance and you fought with your body to protect others.”\nIn a post marking 100 days since October 7, Liron wrote that she was still struggling to come to terms with his death, and that “every morning I wake up and understand that this is my new reality.”\n“The longing does not let up and the thoughts are unbearable,” she added. “But I want to tell you that I have chosen life alongside the pain that shattered me into pieces. Tomorrow, Nevo turns two and I promise to celebrate him and make him happy exactly as you would have wanted. You never got to see him start talking and you would go crazy for him now that he is playful and funny exactly like you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She was the heart of every event, the first to get up on the table and boost the mood.

She taught me how to dance. She loved animals and she planned to open a dog grooming salon — she was working in a bakery to save money for this.”\nHer sister, Orel, told a local news site that Yuval “was a ball of energy in the house, full of joy, already from a young age she would see the distress of others and make their voices heard.” During the shiva mourning period, Orel said, “all her friends shared how she would always know how to raise morale and make people happy.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Ori Arad, 22, from Holon, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nOri was working as a bartender at the rave when the attack began, and he called his parents and told them about the rocket fire and said he would be leaving soon. At 7:10 a.m., his family said, he called from his car where he was stuck amid the traffic and the slaughter along Route 232. He told his father that he felt he had no choice but to attempt to plow into the terrorists with his car in an attempt to escape. That was the last they heard from him.\nTwo young women later tracked down by the family told them that Ori picked them up in his car after their own was totaled, and told them, “Girls, I’m getting you out of here.” When he floored it toward the terrorists, they opened fire on the car, which flipped over. Ori was wounded and lost consciousness, while the women played dead in order not to attract attention. He later awoke and the motion drew the eye of the terrorists, who fired again, killing him. The two women managed to survive until they were rescued three hours later.\nEster Borohov, one of the women who survived, told a local news site, “Ori Arad is my hero. He is the one who saved us. I want the world to know what a hero he was — it is thanks to his bravery and resourcefulness that we are here.”\nOri was buried in Holon on October 10. He is survived by his parents, Yossi and Sigal, and his older brothers Shai and Nir.\nHe served his mandatory army service in an intelligence unit, and just a few weeks after he was released, took off on a whirlwind post-army trip. After months in Berlin, Petra, Sinai, Milan, Thailand, Vietnam and South Korea, Ori returned home not long before the Supernova rave. He was slated to begin a degree in economics and psychology at Tel Aviv University just a week after he was killed.\nHis family and friends remembered him for his signature curls, dimple and his broad smile. He loved music of all types, as well as all sorts of animals, and was known as a conversationalist and a philosopher with thoughts on every topic.\nHis brother, Shai, told Channel 12 news that Ori “was the most handsome and the biggest charmer there was, very moral, with the widest heart, always ready to help with everything. He was a young man who loved life, his friends, and also a very task-oriented guy, setting goals and barrelling towards those that interested him. Everything he wanted to achieve, he did, he’s the most talented guy I ever met in my life.”\nOn what would have been his 23rd birthday, his mother, Sigal, wrote on an Instagram memorial page, “You will always live inside me, just like 23 years ago, when you came from me into the world, clear, beautiful, clean and pure.”\nTheir family “battles every morning to see the sun and in the rays we see your smile, your smart eyes, the heart that guides us to follow your path,” she added. “I promise you by beloved son, we will love and cry and rejoice and live you every day inside us.

Danit Cohen and Sgt. Shir Shlomo, who were also both slain that day. So much so, her mother said, that even though Lior was supposed to be on medical leave after getting an infection following laser eye surgery, she insisted on going back to the base to spend the holiday weekend there with them.\nWhen the rocket fire began, a group of soldiers on the base, including Lior, ran to the bomb shelter on site. When they realized the base had been infiltrated by terrorists, they ran to the war room, which they believed to be more secure. Lior and two other soldiers were shot dead as they ran between buildings. Four more soldiers on base were killed inside the war room.\nLior was buried on October 9 in Dimona.

She always aspired to learn more to be as professional as possible, helped everyone and took care of the patients like they were family.”\nHer mother, Rachel told Ynet that “she volunteered from age 14 with MDA — even when she would come home from the base she would head off to a shift, every break and every holiday. It ran in her veins.”\nHer family said she also loved to cook, with her signature dishes including pasta in rose sauce and her no-bake tea biscuit and pudding cake, which she would make at home every week and bring to the base.\nLior’s older sister, Eden, wrote on Instagram three months after she was killed about how “every little thing reminds me of you.”\n“Brushing my teeth in the morning when my toothbrush is next to yours, walking in the hallway next to your room which has stayed exactly the same, wearing the clothes that we bought together, sitting in your spot and eating the food that you loved to eat,” Eden recounted.\n“Every word reminds me of you. My whole life you were next to me and who I am without you?” she added. “I’ll never come to terms with your loss because you will always be with me.

They traced his car to Netivot, and a family member found it with three bodies inside — none of them Barak. Eventually, his relatives pieced together his movements and realized that he abandoned his car next to the shelter, and other fleeing partygoers had taken it to try and escape.\nBarak was buried in Holon on October 13. He is survived by his parents, Nitza and Herzl, and his older half-siblings Tami, Sharona, Avi and Tomer.\nHe was a talented soccer player in his youth, his family said, playing as a left-back for a local team, and was also a devoted fan of Maccabi Tel Aviv.\nOn what would have been his 29th birthday, Barak’s cousin Keren wrote on Facebook how much they kept hoping “that you would walk in the door with your smile and say ‘everything’s fine, I’m here.'”\n“I have no doubt that all the angels up above are celebrating you — you were one of a kind and you always will be! The best child ever, who loved everyone and was loved by everyone. We will remember you in our hearts forever,” wrote Keren.\nAlso on his birthday, his close friend Daniel Mekhtiev wrote on Facebook that instead of turning 29, “you will stay forever 28 years old.”\n“You were my best friend and so much more than that, you were an incredible example of humanity, of how people really need to behave — your kind-heartedness, your generosity, your laughter, your emotion, your concern for everyone, including those you only met a minute earlier, that was your uniqueness, and you will stay special forever,” he wrote.\nBarak’s aunt Ahuva asked on Facebook, “How could God allow you to leave us so soon — a good and modest boy, handsome, a pure soul… it seems God must need you up there.”\nHis friend, Sharon Ross, told a local news outlet that Barak “was the happiest guy in our crew, the funniest and with the best heart.” On the truck he drives for work, Ross hung a huge poster of Barak, with the words “Barak Davidi, dance forever, our angel” on it. He said, “We tend to forget people quickly, and it was important to me that he be remembered.”\nWriting on a memorial site for fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv, Barak’s sister Sharona wrote that from a young age, he was “a beloved and happy child with endless generosity to everyone, funny, always gathering and uniting everyone — his family and friends.”\nShe noted that while she supported an opposing team, the pair would still go to games together and continue their good-natured feud: “But at the end he would always say, ‘Eventually I’ll get you to sit in the Maccabi bleachers!'”\nOur Barak, she wrote, “You left us too soon and left a huge scar in all of our hearts — your parents, siblings, nieces and nephews, friends and everyone who knew you. Today all we have left is to memorialize you everywhere we can, and we promise we will do that always.”\n“Dance forever, our angel, we’ll remember you forever.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

His father said that Rotem texted him “to take care of [his girlfriend] Adi and not to tell her that he was heading to the south.” That was the last they heard from him.\nHis unit arrived first near Netiv Ha’asara, before being called to Kfar Aza, the site of some of the worst atrocities.

They kidnapped my friend. They’re shooting at all the houses. Report it, call people. They’re breaking into all the homes.”\nIn the final video of Aviad alive, he could be seen outside his home in the kibbutz’s youth wing warning his neighbors to head inside and hide. The footage was filmed by Yotam Haim, who was taken hostage and accidentally killed by the IDF in Gaza in December.\nAviad’s sister said that when he realized that the door to his reinforced room didn’t close, he headed next door to the home of Alon Shamriz, and joined him there. Shamriz was kidnapped and accidentally killed alongside Haim in Gaza.\nAviad was considered missing for close to a week until his body was finally identified. He was buried on October 13 in Nitzan. His family later said that he was identified and buried without his head, which was found separately several weeks afterward and only buried in his grave five months later.\nHe is survived by his parents, Itzik and Ronit, and his siblings Lizi, Yisrael and Lital. He had a unique and close bond with his nieces and nephews, his family said.\nAviad grew in Gush Katif before moving to the southern town of Nitzan after the 2005 disengagement, and just a few months before he was killed, he decided to move to Kfar Aza. For the past three years, Aviad worked in marketing and selling grapes grown at a family-owned farm in the area. The family later named one of their vineyards after him in his memory.\nHis childhood friend, Liz Sela, wrote on Facebook that she would never stop “memorializing you, the things that characterized you so much.”\n“Your love for people and food… you loved to host and knew how to be hospitable like the patriarch Abraham,” she added. “Our unique friend, who united us with his love for life, for food, for laughter, for joy. You left us heartbroken, and full of longing. You turned simple things, like grapes, full of meaning.”\nHis mother, Ronit, told the Kan public broadcaster that “the world lost a wonderful boy, with values, funny, who took everything easily — he had such a smile, dimples. He was a whole world.”\nHis older sister, Lizi, wrote on Facebook a week after his funeral, “This is the first time that I can speak about you and you won’t interrupt me. The first time I can speak and I won’t hear your firm opinion about my opinion. The first time I will speak and you won’t find something to laugh at me about.”\nLizi recalled that from Aviad’s very first steps, “You were quick, a man of action, moving from place to place, acquiring friends with ease — falling in love with your warm and bright nature was easy. A man of people, a man of humor and friends. You were a nonstop prankster, I’m sure there’s nobody here you didn’t pull a prank on.”\nBut, she added, “With your captivating smile full of innocence, nobody could ever be angry at you. You were a family man, with respect and values, you always sought to lend a hand, to be a support to others, with an open heart and a wide hand.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was buried on October 19 in Nir Am following a funeral service in Tel Aviv.\nHe is survived by his parents, Tamar and Yehiel, his siblings Aviel, Mor, Tal, Gil and Dan and his stepfather Patrick Cohen.\nIn a 2015 interview with Channel 13 news, Ziv, then a high school senior, said, “It doesn’t seem logical that there’s a war every year in Israel. This doesn’t happen in any other country.”\nAccording to a eulogy on the National Insurance Institute website, Ziv was born in Eilat but as an infant moved to Kibbutz Mishmar Hanegev, and when he was five settled in Nir Am, following his mother’s marriage to Patrick.\nIn middle and elementary school, Ziv played soccer, even participating in a tournament abroad, and in high school, he learned guitar. He completed a year of national service on Kibbutz Sde Boker before enlisting in the army. After being released he studied pipe welding, and he worked for the gas company Chemo Aharon.\nHis family said he also had a strong artistic side, dabbling in making jewelry as well as drawing, painting and songwriting. He was also the owner of his beloved dog Loopy.\nNiv Ast, a friend and musician, released “A Song for Pepe,” with the lyrics, “I hope we can dance again.” Niv wrote that Ziv “was full of love, caring and music. We met in many of my shows and became friends. I tried to weave his happiness and smile into this track.”\nZiv was also into the music scene and worked as a promoter for the Collabo club, which held an evening of music in June in his memory, writing that “our Ziv Pepe was a true lover of freedom, the last man standing on the dance floor and one who never stopped smiling. Pepe worked with us as part of the Ratzif production at Collabo, but quickly became a true friend to most of us.”\nWriting on his Instagram memorial page, his mother, Tami, said that “Ziv was an artist in his soul. He loved to draw and sculpt, he could find metal wires in the field and weave them together and create a beautiful flower that he would plant in a pot. He decorated the walls of his caravan with his own drawings.”\nHe loved parties and raves and took part in many both in Israel and Europe, she added. “It was very natural for him to go to the Supernova festival from which he never returned, at just age 26. The war ended everything.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Shilo Har-Even, and four other Golani soldiers, including Staff Sgt. Dvir Zakai, as they tried to repel the Hamas invasion of the base.\nHis family was only informed four days later that he had been killed.\nDor was buried on October 12 in Rishon Lezion. He is survived by his parents, Galit and Yossi, and his younger brother Matan.\nA talented basketball player, he played with the Maccabi Rishon Lezion youth team, which memorialized him as “a wonderful kid and player who always helped his friends and prioritized the value of giving above all else.”\nHis close friend, Orel Avikzar, wrote on Instagram that he was struggling to write about Dor in the past tense.\n“You always took such care of everyone. All the plans that you planned. You were such a warrior,” he wrote. “I know on that terrible Saturday you fought until your last bullet and you managed to save hundreds of people.”\nTheir army breaks never seemed to line up, Avikzar added, and the last time he saw Dor was at the funeral of their mutual friend, Sgt. Lia Ben Nun, who was killed in a cross-border attack from Egypt in June 2023.\n“My friend, I will never ever forget you, how you would come over and fall asleep because you were tired from the base, and how you would go along with me with everything. You are part of my life forever.”\nDor’s father, Yossi, told Walla that when he enlisted in Golani, “he never for a moment abandoned his love for sports,” noting his support for the Maccabi Tel Aviv basketball team and Beitar Jerusalem soccer club. “Our dream was to fly to watch Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Final Four.”\nWatching games now without him, he said, “My thoughts are always on him. He was supposed to be already now a released soldier.” Dor, he said, “achieved all of his missions. It was always hard for him, but he reached every goal and I was so proud of him. He always helped his friends.”\nWhen he had a break from the army, “Dor would immediately look to go play basketball or soccer with his friends. He didn’t rest for a moment at home,” his father said. “It’s like he knew he was living on borrowed time. That he was living with a time limit. He didn’t want to sleep, he wanted to take advantage of every moment.”\nHis mother, Galit, told Walla that during his two years in the army, “Dor went through a serious change. He was a very indulged child, and the army changed him.”\nEvery day since he was killed, she said, “I miss him.”\n“I miss his requests for shnitzel when he would come home from the army. I miss his hugs, his kisses, his words. The connection he had with his younger brother Matan who misses him.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Yaakov Ozeri, 28, a soldier in the 401st Armored Brigade’s 52nd Battalion, from Kfar Shamai, was killed on November 7, 2023, while battling against Hamas in northern Gaza.\nYaakov was called up to reserve duty on October 21 following the outbreak of the war, and was sent into Gaza not long after. His family said they were told by the army that he was killed in a tank explosion rigged by Hamas operatives.\nHe was buried on November 8 in Meron. He is survived by his partner, Hagar Daniels, their daughter, Ella, who was born four months after he was killed, as well as his parents, Lilian and Yisrael, and his six siblings, Tehila, Nofar, Tzlil, Lior, Yehiel and Aviv.\nHis brother, Yehiel, told Ynet that Yaakov was galvanized by the October 7 Hamas assault: “He wasn’t calm, he wanted to give back as much as he could. He volunteered in efforts, he joined the local security team [where he grew up] despite living in Binyamina, he pushed for them to call him up to the reserves, even though he had an exemption — he wouldn’t let it go.”\nIn the weeks between the attack and his reserve duty, Yaakov also used his sewing skills to create all sorts of army accessories for soldiers on the front lines.\nYehiel said Yaakov was first stationed on a base in the north but he pushed to be sent south, “He wanted to be in Gaza. He had values, I am sure that he had no shadow of a doubt about what he was doing and what he was fighting for.”\nYaakov, who spent two years traveling abroad following his army service, was a student of industrial design at the Shenkar College in Ramat Gan. He was also an artist as well as a tattoo artist, sharing his works on his Instagram page “The Traveling Ink,” with the final post dated October 7, 2023.\nAlex Padwa, who taught Yaakov in the past, told Portfolio magazine that “there was something exceptional in this guy — and I’m not just saying that because of the tragedy… it was clear that he was a born designer, with huge talent, in his element, even if it was hard for him sometimes. He had a high aesthetic sensitivity, a different kind of thinking and creativity. And courage.”\nOn what would have been his 29th birthday, Yaakov’s sister, Tehila, wrote on Instagram that he was “the most wonderful gift that we could get as a family. It was too short, but you will be in our hearts forever.”\nHagar was 22 weeks pregnant when Yaakov was killed, telling Maariv in February that he was so excited for the birth, that he had already felt the baby kick and that they had picked out the name together.\n“We didn’t get a chance to get married, we said we’d get married after everything was over, but we never managed,” she said. “Yaakov could have been the most incredible father in the world, he was looking forward to it.”\nShe told Ynet that Yaakov crammed so much into his days, even while he was fighting in the south and in Gaza he filled every moment. After he was killed, she said, the army returned to her “eight crates of his belongings — he took the whole house, his sewing machine, dishes, his coffee maker, everything that would make everyone’s life a little easier.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Border Police Supt. Nissim Lugasi, 29, from Moshav Beit Shikma, was killed battling Hamas terrorists in Ofakim on October 7.\nLugasi rushed to the scene early that Saturday morning when he first heard that terrorists had infiltrated the western Negev city. Armed only with a pistol and without any body armor, he linked up with some other police officers who had just arrived in Ofakim. The officers engaged with Hamas gunmen that had taken hostages in a residential building in the city and Lugasi was shot dead at the scene.\nHe was buried on October 12 in Ashkelon. He is survived by his parents, Shimon and Ahuva, his three older sisters, Moran, Hadar and Yael, and his fiancee Liel.\nLugasi enlisted in the Border Police in 2012 and served in a wide range of positions both as an enlisted man and an officer.\nIn an interview with Ynet on October 22, his sister Yael Friedman Lugasi described how the three sisters saw their little brother as a hero, the one who always charged in first, always gave everything he had, and always found a way to spread joy.\n“In every role he had, he did things in the most professional way. He was simply a leader. At the shiva [mourning period] everyone told us that he was always the first. Always the first to arrive and that’s what he did that same day.”\nShe added that her little brother “loved every moment in life. In his service, during operations, in everything, always. Every person he met became family, became a friend, and he made the most of every moment, his smile cast light upon everyone around him.”\nNisim’s family set up a memorial page in his honor — but on the site they make it clear that this is no memorial site.\n“This site is not a memorial site to Nisim. A memorial is for someone who is no longer with us… Nisim is with us always. He is with us every moment, every second, during every experience — happy or sad. Nisim is an eternal love that will always be in our hearts.”\nHis family wrote that in his time in the Border Police, Nisim “always believed fully in the values of love of country, a sense of mission and devotion to others, and at every opportunity he made sure to teach these values to his subordinates.”\nNisim took part in a project the Border Patrol carried out in collaboration with “Mishkafayim Verudot,” (rose-colored glasses) a charity that provides medical assistance to Holocaust survivors. As part of the project, Nisim and his fellow officers escorted survivors to medical appointments and helped them carry out other essential daily tasks. At the shiva for Nisim, his family was presented with a plaque from the charity, thanking him for his help.\nIn a video uploaded to the not-a-memorial website, a recording of Nisim speaking to a member of the charity can be heard.\n“We are always here for you and for those dear people, it’s a huge mitzvah. Thank you for the privilege to help. Shabbat Shalom, we’re always here for you, whatever you need,” he said.\nNisim and his fiancee, Liel Asayag, had been together for seven years and were planning on getting married in June. Speaking to Kan News months after he was slain, Asayag said she would have preferred for him not to be a hero, to be here today, by her side.\n“But with that, I’m so proud of him, that he was true to himself to the final moment that he charged forward, that he ran out of the house [that morning] without hesitation, that he fought until the last moment in order to know that people there were safe.”\nOn the site, on a page titled “Our Little Brother,” Yael, Hadar, and Moran talk about Nisim, the life of the party, the light of their lives, the hole left behind in all of their hearts that will never be filled.\nHadar spoke of how he came out to visit and stay with her in the United States for three weeks, spontaneously, calling her one day and telling her to get the bed in the guest room ready for Uncle Nisim.\n“My Nisim, my love, the life of this family, the light, the laughter. How you knew to look at everything with humor, you’re for sure looking down on us right now from up above and laughing: What are you crying for, put on some techno and dance.”\nShe added: “Nisim, take care of mom and dad, and all of us… Give us the strength to carry on with this huge hole in our hearts.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He is survived by his parents, Dafna and Avner, and his older brother Eyal.\nYonathan was in Sri Lanka on vacation when the Hamas October 7 onslaught began, and he immediately headed back to Israel to return to active duty. At his funeral, his comrade read out the message he sent them after his return home: “I’m in Brenner, getting ready, I’ll be with the unit soon, take me into account… If you need me, schedule me in. I want to contribute.”\nA talented artist, he drew and created from a young age, continuing with his hobby until his very last days. He was also accomplished in karate, even competing internationally.\nAt his funeral, his father, Avner, recalled — according to Ynet — that “you loved to run in the kibbutz, you were a perfectionist in everything, in drawing, sculpture, karate. The [Shaldag] unit was a good fit for you… despite all your talent, you were never arrogant, you had a quiet inner confidence, without hubris.”\nHis comrades told his family after his death that shortly before he was killed he even drew an image of his dog, Oscar, who had just recently died, in chalk on the board of a school in Gaza which the soldiers were using as a base of operations. It was his final ever drawing, immortalized in a photo snapped by a comrade.\nAnat Eshel-Gur, who trained with him in karate, told Haaretz that “he was very modest and open, not set in his way like most kids his age. He was patient and attentive. We traveled together to a training camp in Belgium and I saw his drawings on his phone and was deeply moved.”\nIn a Memorial Day post on the Israeli Air Force website, his mother, Dafna, said, “Already from age 2 we let him draw alone in his room. His art was his most private place, it was an island of quiet for him. Yonathan gave his all to everything and demanded the best from himself, but he had a unique and deeper passion for art.”\nDafna said her son was quiet and reserved, “and he expressed how he felt through drawing and only sometimes spoke about his feelings with me and with his close friends… I knew to give him his space because I understood that was his way to express his feelings.”\nHis older brother, Eyal, told the IAF site that “Yonathan had many contrasting qualities, that somehow complemented each other, and made him who he was. On the one hand, he was a tough fighter who pushed himself forward, and on the other hand, he had the soul of an artist, of a sensitive and gentle guy.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

When the Hamas invasion began, he headed out to defend the kibbutz with the rest of the security team and was killed along with six other members of the team. The family dog was also shot dead in their home, which Hamas ransacked.\nNadav was buried on October 17 in Kokhav Michael. He is survived by his partner, Jessica Timmer, their two children Roni, 6, and Dean, 3, his mother Poly and his siblings Dan and Nir. His father, Naftali, predeceased him.\nHe worked for the past eight years as an art teacher at the Yehiel School in Tal Shahar, a Waldorf-style school that focuses on creativity and free expression. A post from the Education Ministry described him as a “revered teacher and a beloved man with a huge soul.”\nSchool principal Yosi Sofer told Portfolio magazine, “Nadav built the school with his own two hands. He created all the infrastructure, where the sewers would be, the electricity, the pergolas, which facilities would serve the children, where to put the benches, which plants to plant. When he got here there was almost nothing.”\nNadav’s focus as a teacher was on creating art with wood, “and he had four classes, and it was important to him to get to know all the students deeply… He sat with the kids and he listened to them, he was always interested in them.”\nHis friend Mor Teper wrote in Ynet for Memorial Day about their last meeting, “when you sat here with us, and helped us plan our garden and what made sense for us to grow.”\nSometimes she likes to imagine, she wrote, what would be if October 7 had never happened: “I imagine you coming to us on Saturday morning on your motorized scooter, with Jess and the kids, suggesting we go out to some grove to pick mushrooms. That we hike together with the kids, and you explain to them with such patience and sensitivity about different types of mushrooms, about trees and the environment.”\nNadav’s presence, Mor added, “always gave me a sort of calm, and comfort. When you were around it was as if things became simpler for a while… You brought with you a special magic that had in it seriousness and playfulness, depth and levity, patience and resourcefulness. You always knew how to find a way to connect things and to connect people.”\nHis mother, Poly, told Portfolio that working with wood “filled his life. He built wood projects in the kibbutz, like the wonderful bar in the library where I worked, and he also gave workshops for adults with Livnat Kutz.”\nFrom a young age, she said, “he loved nature. He searched for butterflies, would go out with a plant identifier, he would take his kids and their friends to the forest to pick mushrooms. It was a common sight to see him wandering the paths with a basket and scissors, or working and sowing in the gardens. He had a gentle soul, always saw the good, the positive. Nadav was a man of love.”\nA few days after he was killed, Jessica shared on Facebook video of him dancing with their children just a few hours earlier, the last footage of him alive.\n“This is how I want him to be remembered,” she wrote. “A man who loved celebrations, who danced until his feet hurt (and even then kept dancing), the best father any woman could want for her children, an educator, a family man, a man of love… Nadav is our hero. Everyone should know that he went out to fight for our home, Kfar Aza.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Shalev Baranes, 20, a Golani Brigade soldier from Kfar Baruch, was killed on October 7 while battling the Hamas invasion of the Paga IDF outpost.\nHis father Avshalom told the Kan public broadcaster that around 8:30 a.m. that day, Shalev texted him that everything was OK and he would call soon. But there was never any call.\nA group of soldiers, including Shalev, barricaded themselves inside the outpost’s dining hall as the terrorists invaded, while Hamas tried to set it on fire. According to Haaretz, Shalev and a group of three other soldiers, including Staff Sgt. Itay Glisko, decided not to wait inside and left the dining hall to try and fight back against the invaders and allow the others to escape. All four were killed in the battle.\n“23 soldiers left the dining hall alive,” his mother Eva told Haaretz. “My son did not. He could have waited to be rescued, but he chose to go out and fight, because he knew there were no reinforcements. He said, ‘That’s not how I will end my life. A terrorist won’t burn me to death.'”\nHis father said they only received confirmation that he had been killed three days later. Shalev was buried on October 11 in Kfar Baruch. He is survived by his parents, Avshalom and Eva, and his younger siblings Ron, 17, and May, 11.\nHis mother told Kan he had recently purchased a new motorcycle, and was excited to take it out on trips in the area where they lived. His family said they always knew he would serve in Golani, following in the footsteps of his father and his uncle.\n“I’m so, so proud of this boy,” she told Channel 14. “Shalev was my whole world. And I’m proud of him.”\n“He always excelled,” she said, noting the awards and certifications he received during his army service. “He was always first… that’s what I would expect from my son, fighting until his last moment.” Eva added that “we had a connection that was beyond a mother and son, he was my best friend.”\nEva said though Shalev grew up in a traditional household, he was growing closer to observance, and after he enlisted “he would come home with a black kippa on, and put on tefillin, and wear tzitzit.” In his memory, she said, she has also began to adopt a more religious lifestyle.\nHis grandfather, Alex Baranes, told a local news site that Shalev “was a prince. A wonderful kid, even within his family he always made sure to be the leader and the supporter.”\nTheir close connection existed “from the day he was born… every Friday that he would come home from the army he would come to us with his parents and siblings and eat savta’s cooking. He would take me to the side and update me on what he was doing in the army, where he was stationed and that everything was OK.”\nTheir last text exchange, he said, was on Friday before the holiday began, “He wrote to me ‘chag sameach [happy holiday] to you and savta.’ I responded to him: ‘Take care of yourself.’ That was the last message from him, and the next day he was killed.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

They were buried in Ashdod on October 19.\nRoland, a native of Tunisia, moved to France as a teenager and made his way to Israel a few years later. Ronit was born in Israel to immigrants from Argentina, who went back there when she was a child, and she returned herself at age 18, according to La’Isha. The couple met at Kibbutz Kerem Shalom, wed and had their two children. They later spent four years in Argentina and then returned to Israel and settled in Kibbutz Holit.\nThe family said that despite their native tongues of French and Spanish, the couple raised their children on the kibbutz in Hebrew.\nRoland worked for many years as the community manager of Holit, before retiring less than a year before he was killed. Yoav Boukay, the man who took his place in the role, noted that Roland “knew every single thing in Holit.”\nWhen he took over the job in December 2022, Yoav said he asked Roland if he wanted more time to wrap things up: “Roland gave me an inscrutable look and said he has been waiting for the moment to retire. That he has many things to do and he needs a little rest from his many activities in the kibbutz. So he retired and started to renovate his house.”\nRonit worked most of her life in early childhood education, and in her later years decided to return to academia, beginning her bachelor’s degree at Sapir College in Sderot at age 40. At the time of her death, she had been working for five years on a doctorate at Ben Gurion University in Beersheba, which explored the role of art as protest during the military junta which ruled Argentina from 1976-1983.\nProf. Ronit Milano, who was her thesis adviser, told Globes that Ronit “started her studies from nothing until she became a valued researcher. Everyone sought her advice. At her funeral and shiva, her sons said how much her research made her happy, how much joy it brought to their home.”\nAt the same time, she was also an instructor at Sapir College. Dr. Inbal Ben-Asher Gitler described her to La’Isha as a “super-talented and dedicated lecturer, who made sure to see all of her students. In the summer she was supposed to teach her first course with a doctorate, in the communications department, on ethics and visual culture. She was so excited for it.”\nTheir daughter-in-law Nir described Roland as “a bit mischievous, and he always knew how to say something to break the ice. He cared very much about people and it was hard not to love him.”\nRonit, she said, “was practical, but she always tried to make things light and say that everything would be OK.”\nThe couple “always took care of each other and completed each other — I never saw them fighting or arguing. They really loved their children and their grandchildren. If I ever even mentioned any difficulty, they immediately jumped in to help.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Shortly afterward, he said, “four men showed up, they came straight up to our house, they were in plain clothes, but they had guns, grenades and knives,” recounted Yama.\n“Lee was sitting in the shelter next to the house,” he continued. “They pointed the gun at him, on his head, so he walked along with them.”\nYama managed to escape out the window, but Nitikorn was killed alongside their other friend, Settha “Tom” Homsorn, while others were taken captive.\n“I am sorry that I couldn’t save them,” he said. “I saw it all but I couldn’t do anything.

Martin Kyzmickas, 46, a company commander in the National Enforcement Unit, from Sderot, was killed on October 7 while battling Hamas terrorists at the Sderot Police Station.\nAccording to Israel Hayom, Martin had just completed an overnight shift and returned home when the attack began. He heard the sounds of gunfire and headed back toward the police station where he was killed in the battle.\nThe police station was the site of heavy battles as Hamas terrorists stormed the building and holed up inside. Ultimately more than two dozen officers were killed, and the next day security forces demolished the building, killing the remaining terrorists inside.\nDeputy Commissioner Amir Cohen told Israel Hayom that just minutes before he was shot dead, Martin turned to him and said: “Commander, this is what I’ve been waiting for, to battle terrorists.”\nMartin was killed just a few weeks before what would have been his 47th birthday.\nHe was buried in Tel Aviv on October 10. He is survived by his wife, Svetlana, their three children, Alisa, Mark and Tom, as well as his mother, Irena and a sister.\nBorn in Vilnius, Lithuania, Martin moved to Israel in 1995 at age 18. He joined the Israel Police in 2005 and remained in the force until his death more than 18 years later.\nCommander Eyal Raon, the head of Martin’s division in the police, said that when he couldn’t reach him that morning, “the first thing we said was of course, he’s gone out to fight. It’s in his DNA… he was a hero.”\nDanny Shtein, who served in the IDF with Martin, wrote on Facebook that he was the “most Rambo soldier I know. He raised his hand to volunteer for everything, from the most junior to most insane. A quiet soldier. Didn’t complain, not a conversationalist. To be with him in battle or in training and to see him on autopilot with his MAG rifle was incredible.”\n“Martin was a warrior in every inch of his being. He was tough and quiet. Didn’t talk, didn’t argue or get into fights,” Shtein added. “Everybody loved him. Everybody wanted to be Martin.”\nIn a video put out by the Israel Police in his memory, his wife, Svetlana, said he headed back out to fight that day “because that was his choice, because he’s a viking.” Back when they met, she said, he was a fighter, “he was a warrior in his blood.”\nSvetlana said when he headed back out early that morning, “I just heard the door close behind him. He didn’t say goodbye. We didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.”\nAt his funeral, she noted that her husband was not a particularly smiley man, “but when he smiled, he smiled. He smiled from all his heart.” In each of their three children, she said, “there is half of him. So I have a Martin and a half.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Maj. Tal Grushka, 25, a company commander in the Nahal Brigade’s 931st Battalion from Kfar Saba, was killed on October 7 while battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nTal was on his way with his soldiers from where they were stationed in Gush Etzion to Kibbutz Kfar Aza when they encountered a cell of terrorists along the way, and a gun battle ensued, during which he was killed.\nHe was close friends throughout much of his army career with Maj. Roey Chapell, who was also killed that day while fighting near Gaza. Roey was slated to complete his army service just a week after he was killed, and Tal was supposed to take over his job as commander of Nahal’s Orev Company — yet neither lived long enough to take those next steps.\nTal was buried on October 10 in Kfar Saba. He is survived by his parents, Edva and Yosef, his siblings Itai, Yael, Itay and Hadar, and his girlfriend, Inbal Lapid.\nOn Memorial Day in 2023, Tal published a post on Facebook about why he chose to pursue an army career in a combat role, despite the many difficulties and challenges.\n“Today, 75 years after the establishment of the state, the sword that was placed upon our necks from the dawn of history is still sharp and threatening,” he wrote. “Some of our neighbors are still not seeking peace, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, Iran and its affiliates, all try to challenge our existence. My fellow fighters, each and every one of us is a decisive factor in our meaningful service, and when needed on the battlefield… only together can we ensure quiet for the citizens of the State of Israel and continue to protect its independence.”\nA talented pianist from a young age, after his death Channel 12 uncovered footage from an interview he gave to the network at age 10, ahead of a piano competition, during which he expressed excitement about his upcoming performance.\nHis older brother, Itay Bichler, told Calcalist in a memorial video that “Tal was an exceptional young man, talented at playing the piano, expressing himself through writing and acting with great talent, and later became an exceptional soldier and commander.”\nItay noted that every time Tal left base for the weekend he would instruct the soldiers under his command “to get their phones out and call their grandparents and wish them a Shabbat Shalom,” something Itay hoped would turn into a tradition in Tal’s memory.\nTal’s girlfriend of close to four years, Inbar Lapid, told the Davar news outlet that he excelled in every area of his life.\n“Everywhere he went he excelled, in everything, picking up certificates of excellence in every course, team, battalion, platoon commander’s course, officer’s training — he had all the certificates in his office. He was that annoying kind of person, how could he succeed in everything he touched? How are you good at everything you do, as well as handsome and cool? He wasn’t a nerd or a bookworm. He just had this magic touch in his fingers.”\nHe was deeply devoted to the army, she said, which irked her when he was delayed to meet her during his infrequent breaks since he had to ensure everything was in order. “He always had to make sure 100%. A control freak and stubborn. He loved the army too much…. one of the things I loved most about Tal was that he knew exactly what he wanted and you couldn’t stop him.”\nIn the interview six weeks after he was killed, Inbar said she still sees him everywhere.\n“In my head I see him in every place, standing in the kitchen, standing behind the barbecue, sitting in the hammock, sitting on the chair outside, on the couch, asleep in bed, doing pull-ups outside… I will never stop loving Tal.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Omer Zadikevitch, 50, was murdered by Hamas terrorists just outside his home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7.\nHome alone in the kibbutz that Saturday morning, Omer headed to his reinforced room when the rocket fire began. But not long after, he decided to head out. His family said he was in charge of the communications systems of the Sha’ar Hanegev region, and was supposed to head to the regional council’s war room during any such escalation.\nAs seen on his home’s camera next to his back door, Omer, with his backpack on his shoulders, called a neighbor to seek advice on whether to head out, then decided to leave, walking outside hesitantly at 7:16 a.m. He was never seen or heard from again alive, and his family believes he was shot dead within minutes, next to his car.\nHis former brother-in-law, Shachar Aviani, the Kfar Aza local security chief, was also killed that day.\nIn an interview with Channel 13 news in 2014, during the 50-day war, Omer suggested on camera that if they ever heard about a terrorist invasion of the kibbutz, “we’d run to the car and flee… that’s your only chance to stay alive,” he said then, as his then-wife suggested she would hide their children in closets.\nHis funeral was held on October 16 in Sde Warburg, and he was buried privately afterward in Kfar Aza. He is survived by his four children, Liran, Netaly, Lior and Gali, his girlfriend Shimrit Sfarad and her son, Ma’ayan, his mother, Dina and his three brothers, Nir, Yaniv and Uri. His father, Yoel, died exactly a month before Omer was killed.\nOn Omer’s gravestone, his family engraved a sentence he said just a few weeks earlier at his father’s funeral: “My father, you will never be dead to me, the spirit of life you infused in me will stay in my heart forever.” After his father died, Omer decided to purchase the plot next to him, surprising his family who didn’t understand why he was suddenly speaking of his own mortality.\nFamily and friends described Omer as a childlike optimist, with a deep love for the kibbutz where he lived for decades, and built his own home largely with his own hands. An IT professional, he could always be called on to solve any computer issues large or small. He was known for his deep love of surfing and the ocean, something he instilled in all of his children, and also loved to document through photography and videography, including on his YouTube channel.\nHis girlfriend, Shimrit, noted in a post on Facebook that she met Omer while pregnant, “and he embraced my son Maayan and raised him like his own — from before his birth until [he was killed].” Omer was with her in the hospital when Maayan was born, she wrote, “and from that moment he was Maayan’s father in every way, his children are really the older siblings of my son.”\nOmer, she said, “beyond being a wonderful father to his wonderful and beloved children, beyond being a magical and happy person who knew everything and could do everything with his own hands and had solutions to everything,” was devoted to her and Maayan even without a biological connection.\nLiran, his son, told Channel 13 that “Dad was a very happy person, even now when I look through his pictures I only see him smiling. He really loved the sea, surfing, and more than anything his children. Those were the two things that drove him in life. We’ll always remember him as happy and joyful and smiling.”\nHis daughter, Gali, wrote on Facebook to “my best friend, the one person who was always there for me. What a wonderful person you were — I never knew anyone else who was so happy, so optimistic like you.”\n“I will keep laughing and being happy just because I know that you would have wanted it,” she added. “I will keep going in my life so that you can look down on me from above and be proud of me.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He is survived by his parents, Muriel and Chaim, his sisters Elior, 25, and Tair, 17, and his fiance, Naama.\nBorn in Jerusalem to immigrant parents from France, Kfir was active in youth groups before attending a pre-army academy in the Golan Heights and then enlisting in the Armored Corps. A week before the October 7 Hamas attack, Kfir proposed to his girlfriend of close to a year, and they were planning an April wedding.\n“He was a very sociable young man, from a young age he was always involved in all sorts of activities in the neighborhood,” Kfir’s father, Haim, told Channel 14. “He really wanted to enlist and to serve — to do something.”\nHaim said Kfir was very modest “but he always stood by his views.” He loved to speak about his experience hiking the Israel Trail, his father said. “He believed it represented the three values he saw as central: love of country, love of the people and love of the Torah,” said his father.\nKfir, he said, believed strongly in the need for the people of Israel to be united: “He would always say that inside the tank, they’re four people, different from each other, with their own histories, backgrounds, approaches to religion, but they’d all drink coffee in the morning together on the tank.”\nNaama Dopelt salutes at the funeral of her fiance, Cpt. Kfir Itzhak Franco, on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem on November 16, 2023. (Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)\nHis mother, Muriel, told Channel 14 that they last saw Kfir on October 7, when he was called up to the front lines with the outbreak of the war. They last spoke, she said, in late October, shortly before he was sent into Gaza.\n“He was an officer and he wanted to set a good example not to have his parents come if others couldn’t, so he told us, ‘Don’t come, please don’t come.’ And I honored that, sadly, and I didn’t see him again,” she said. “We had a unique relationship, and I think his communication with everyone was special… He didn’t judge, he was righteous, he was very humble, he was a leader in modesty, even in war.”\nA day before the start of the war, Muriel said, her family met with Naama’s family, “and we started to talk about a wedding… It was our first time meeting the family, we were so happy to meet them, and everything was pushed off.”\nSpeaking to Arutz Sheva a month after he was killed, Kfir’s fiancee, Naama, described him as “smiling, happy, you could see his life in his eyes, his joy.”\n“We did a lot of silliness together, we were a sort of childlike-but-mature couple, who understood life but still had our fun and our laughs,” she said.\nAt his funeral, Naama said she had already picked out a wedding dress and bought a tallit for him to wear under the huppa, and they had even discussed names for the six children they wanted to have.\n“A week before the war you proposed to me in front of the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem,” she said. “You were like my wall, my stability, my anchor. You told me that was the last surprise, but now you gave me one last surprise.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Omer Gavra, 26, a Shin Bet agent from Gan Yavne, was killed on October 7 by Hamas terrorists while on his way to the front line to respond to the invasion.\nAt 7:45 that morning, about an hour after the terror onslaught began, Omer was summoned by the Shin Bet and asked to head toward the Netivot area, where he encountered a cell of terrorists and was killed.\nHe was buried on October 11 in Gan Yavne. He is survived by his parents, Amir and Michal, his brother Idan and his girlfriend of five years, Rotem Shahaf. The pair were living together on a small farm not far from Sderot, with their beloved dog Dobby.\nOn his gravestone his family engraved a sentence he had said just two weeks earlier at his grandfather’s funeral: “Our actions and our morals echo in this world forever and ever.” His brother and his cousin later tattooed the phrase in his memory.\nDuring his mandatory IDF service, Omer served in the elite Maglan unit. After he was released, he worked as a personal trainer in Crossfit as well as a trainer for youth preparing for army combat roles. A lover of extreme sports, his Instagram page was a collage of snowboarding, skydiving, surfing and more, and he had a partnership with GoPro as a professional sports photographer.\nAccording to a Shin Bet eulogy, he had begun his service with the agency just over a year before he was killed, in the security unit. “Even in his first steps as an employee, it was clear that he would grow and establish himself as a professional and quality security guard in the unit,” the agency said.\n“Omer demonstrated maturity and seriousness, carried out everything assigned to him in the best possible way, demonstrated high self-discipline time and time again, aspired to learn, to improve, and volunteered for every request without hesitation,” the agency added.\nAt his funeral, his five close childhood friends — Matan, Gil, Omer, Yuval and Nadav — recalled how much “you made us laugh, you made us happy, how much you taught, pushed, loved, smiled, drove us crazy, all of the extreme sports, experiences, challenges and crises we went through together, and all of the firsts we experienced together — enlisting, high school, girlfriends, partners, celebrations and funerals, vacations. How much you instilled in us that the six of us were everything, were family.”\n“Your smile, your optimism, your help in every situation will stay with us forever,” they added. “You were always the listening ear who we went to for advice, and you will always be a part of us. We were six and we will stay six, nobody can change that.”\nOmer’s brother, Idan, wrote on Instagram that two months after he was killed, “Sometimes I feel that you are here with me, giving me strength and telling me to keep going as you always would.”\nRotem, Omer’s girlfriend, wrote that he was “without question my soulmate, which is like a best friend but more. And nothing in the world can change that.”\n“I miss everything about you, the skydiving and the fun but also the arguments. Many times you believed in me more than I believed in myself… You taught me about generosity and love and I hope I can continue your path.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Sgt. Danit Cohen, 19, an operations sergeant in the Home Front Command’s Southern District, from Sderot, was killed on October 7 while battling a Hamas invasion of the IDF Urim Base in southern Israel.\nDanit and others on base, including Sgt. Shir Shlomo, headed to the base’s war room when the attack began, believing it to be the safest place. There, along with Cpt. Alina Pravosudova and Sgt. Maj. Aharon Farash, they attempted to prevent the terrorists from storming the war room but were unsuccessful. All but two of the soldiers inside were killed, with the only survivors being those who were wounded but played dead. In total, eight soldiers were killed at the Urim base on October 7.\nDanit is survived by her parents, Yishai and Hana, and her seven siblings, Tamar-Or, Shirel, Eliya, Lior, Taliya, Shenhav and Meshi. She was buried on October 9 in Noga. Her uncle, Master Sgt. Shimon Barami, was killed during his service in the Border Police in 2011.\nShe was a graduate of the prestigious Mae Boyar High School in Jerusalem, where she resided in the dorms throughout her time there. In a post announcing her death, the school described Danit as a “brave girl, sensitive, with high self-awareness. Behind her quiet figure, stood a young woman with a rich internal world, high capabilities and an aspiration for excellence.”\nA eulogy posted on the Dvorah Forum site, which promotes the integration of women into national security positions, noted that Danit excelled in her army role and had even been asked by her superiors to consider taking an officer’s course. The post noted that she had dreams of one day being an actress, and had always played an active role in school plays, dance competitions and had hosted her own stand-up routines for her friends in the dorms. She also loved to cook and bake, in particular alongside her mother, who always made her favorite foods when she returned home from the army.\nDanit’s sister, Taliya, 14, wrote online that when she was home from the army, “We got to do so many things, Danit loved to bake so we always baked her something different… I loved to just watch from the side and see her preparing things with love and joy, and to know that at the end it was for me too.”\n“When Danit was with us for the weekends, there was always laughter, not a minute without laughter,” Taliya continued. “She was so funny and laughed at everything, even when it was aimed at her.” Amid the large family, she said, Danit “was someone who you could tell everything to, and always get good advice… With everyone in the family she shared a unique language and she understood everyone, all nine of us.”\nHer mother, Hana, told Yediot Aharonot that “Danit loved the army and also the job she chose… I knew that her job was to sit in the war room and report if there was an attack or something else. She never told me any more than that.” Instead, Hana said, Danit would send videos of herself on the job playing happy music in the background and write, “See, I’m listening to good music and everyone is happy.”\nDanit, she said, was extremely close to Shir and to Cpl. Lior Levy, who were both slain on the base that day: “Danit was the one who united everyone. Even if she had finished her shift and one of her friends was still on duty, she would stay with them instead of going to sleep.”\nShe recalled dropping Danit off at her base every Tuesday, after “ironing and arranging her uniform and her suitcase. This was our quality time — 25 minutes from Sderot to the base, we would play happy music… A 19-year-old girl, with so many dreams that were shattered.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Sagiv Beilin Ben-Zvi, 24, from Holon, was murdered by Hamas terrorists during their attack on the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nSagiv attended the festival with his close friend Roni Petrovski, who grew up on the same street as him in Holon. Both were listed as missing and feared kidnapped for almost three weeks, before their families were notified on October 25 that their remains had been identified.\nThey were both laid to rest on October 26 in Holon.\nIn late October, Holon MyNet reported that Sagiv was the 10th graduate of Holon’s Kiryat Sharet High School to have been killed or taken hostage on October 7 and in the fighting in the weeks that followed. Those graduates include soldier Agam Berger, who was kidnapped from the Nahal Oz base by Hamas on October 7 and appeared in a Hamas video filmed during the abduction of Berger and her fellow soldiers.\nSagiv’s mother, Natalie said that he and Roni and their other friends had returned from their post-army trip to South America just two months before the festival, and that Sagiv was working as a bartender at a restaurant in Holon.\nNatalie told reporters that on the day of the attack, Sagiv and Roni left the festival at 6:30 and began making their way home. At 6:55, she said he told her that they were on their way back to Holon, but she soon lost contact with him. Their vehicle was later found near Kibbutz Mefalsim, but it would be weeks until the two friends’ bodies were finally found.\nNatalie described her son as “smart, wise, and charming, full of goodness.” She said Sagiv was “always surrounded by tons of friends, he had circles of friends everywhere. He seemed quiet but he had great inner strength.”\nA post on the Instagram memorial page set up for Sagiv describes him as a young man of many interests. He “loved sports and adventures, all types of music, and was nonetheless a total computer geek. His appetite for life knew no bounds, he had so many dreams that he would have surely realized.”\nThe post shows Sagiv at a picnic on a hilltop, smiling back at the camera. It speaks of the bashful smile he’d give teachers after cutting up in class, his freckles and his “beautiful blue-green eyes,” his skills as a born leader, and his ability “to always see the good things and the beauty in everyone.”\nThe author wrote that Sagiv loved history, politics, and international affairs, and believed that he could someday make the world a better place, “but he was just beginning.”\nOn the page, Sagiv’s sister Gil wrote how she is still waiting for him to come home, and that every time she hears a knock on the door her heart races and she runs to the door hoping to see her little brother on the other side. She said she will continue to wait for him every day as long as she lives.\n“I refuse to believe that we won’t see you again in this world. My beloved little brother, the most beautiful boy with the biggest heart. I’m sorry that I couldn’t save you, sorry that I wasn’t there to take the bullets for you instead.

    "story": "Daniel Cohen, 25, from Netanya, was murdered by Hamas at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nShe was killed alongside her best friend, Yohai Ben Zecharia, while trying to flee the festival. She was buried on October 13 at the Shikun Vatikim cemetery in Netanya.\n“I loved how she never surrendered to anything. The world tried to bring her down but she always smiled and gave her all,” Daniel’s partner, Nofar Sabag said.\nNofar described how already from a young age, Daniel was shuffled from one education framework or boarding school to another, moving from city to city and even living on the street for a period of time as a minor. As Nofar described it, Daniel never let her personal hardships dim the joy she brought to those around her.\nOn an Instagram memorial page set up by loved ones, Shiran Shperberg wrote of her drive to learn more about Daniel’s final moments at the festival, to discover what she did in her final moments on Earth. What, if anything, she tried to do to help the other helpless victims around her. Eventually, she found a video that Daniel shot at the Supernova after the attack began.\n“Even during the moments when you yourself started to worry and be afraid, you made sure to calm the people who were with you just the way you always knew how. And my heart was torn apart by the moment when you said, ‘We’re going to be OK.’ You stayed optimistic until the last moment,” Shperberg said.\nShperberg added: “I hope that at least from up above you can see how much people loved you and feel fortunate for the privilege to have known you! You stole the hearts of so many people. And how could you not? All of your essence was to spread light and love freely.”\nThe memorial page is mourning and tears, but also a celebration of life. In every clip Daniel seems to be making somebody laugh, somehow. Smoking a cigarette and singing karaoke (Sarit Hadad, “Shema Yisrael”), dancing in a wig, clowning around with a friend at an events hall, making a friend laugh hysterically while she tries to get a bee out of her hair, dancing in a club with a drink and a smoke while “the stupidest song in the world” thumps out of the speakers.\nThere are also three posts showing Daniel with Michael, the dog she met walking home one day from her job at the hostel. Up until she left town for the Supernova festival, Daniel worked as a counselor at “Ne’ot Aviv,” a boarding house for at-risk teenage girls in Herzliya.\nA post on the website of the Haruv Institute — which focuses on research and training to help abused and neglected children in Israel — wrote of the plans Daniel had for a going-away party at the hostel.\nAccording to the post, Daniel was supposed to finish her job as a counselor at the hostel and invited friends, co-workers, and former hostel residents to a karaoke and BBQ night planned for October 19. Prior to her murder, she had started meeting with residents of the house to say goodbye and talk to them about her — and their — plans for the future.\nOn October 19, a week after Daniel’s body was identified, the hostel residents went ahead with the going-away party, writing notes to her on white balloons that they released skywards.\nIn an Instagram post on October 13, HaAguda, the umbrella organization for the LGBT community in Israel, wrote that Daniel’s friends said “that everywhere she went, she spread light, giving, and care for others.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He and 13 other soldiers were killed in the battle at Sufa, but succeeded in repelling the invasion of the base and killing many of the terrorists.\nHis family was only notified of his death three days later.\nSegev was buried on October 11 in Beit Shean.

He loved nature, loved to be with his friends.”\nWriting in Israel Hayom, Karin said Segev was “a man of nature, open spaces and people — but most of all, of connections. A person who knew to bring people together, from all walks of life, with ease and the naturalness that so defined him. Segev was handsome with kind eyes, moral with a huge heart full of compassion.”\nAs part of a memorial project set up by President Isaac Herzog, his family gave the president a special version of his favorite drink, pear juice, with a commemorative label.\nHis brother, Dvir, told Haaretz that Segev “was the glue of the family, a magical guy. Every free moment he had he would rush to go spend with his friends,” he said, noting that is why the family established a hangout/lookout spot in nature in his honor in his favorite location.\nHe and his friends “would sit there all the time, all of their youth they spent there,” said Dvir. “Segev would love it, it’s symbolic for us that it will be a place his friends will keep visiting, even without him… and enjoy the place and the view that Segev loved so much.”\nSpeaking on Channel 13, Dvir said that the thing that most characterized Segev was “his ability to connect between people — the number of friends he had, the friends in his platoon who called his [favorite pear juice] ‘Segev juice’ after him… That’s how we want to commemorate Segev.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He is survived by his wife, Sharon, their three daughters, Libby, Doron and Gili, his parents, Nurit and Yehuda and his five siblings, Keren, Shoham, Gilli, Oded and Ifat.\nOn the morning of the Hamas onslaught, Ilan received a call from Yasmin Zohar, worried about her son, Ariel, who had gone for an early-morning run amid the attack. Ilan set out to find Ariel, and brought him to his own home where he survived in their safe room with Ilan’s family. Yasmin, her husband Yaniv and their two daughters Keshet and Tehelet were all murdered by Hamas terrorists in their home that day.\nAfter saving Ariel, Ilan set out to defend the kibbutz from the attack, and was slain not long after he texted his wife: “I’m in battle.”\nA eulogy for the kibbutz noted that Ilan had served as its security chief since 2015 “with courage, professionalism, pleasantness, modesty, seriousness and calm, without concessions — he was the most decorated security chief in the region.”\nNoam Tibon, a retired IDF general who headed to Nahal Oz on October 7 to rescue his son and grandchildren, wrote in Globes that Ilan engaged in a “hopeless battle” against the terrorists at the rear gate of the kibbutz: “One brave man against dozens of terrorists… every moment that he succeeded in delaying the terrorists gave another family a chance to save themselves from the horror.”\nEvery time he visited the kibbutz, wrote Noam, “I would see [Ilan] traveling around the kibbutz with his daughters, spreading smiles everywhere and radiating optimism and calm. He was a pillar of the Nahal Oz community, a beloved and appreciated man by many… We will remember him always, with his modest smile and kind look in his eyes.”\nA huge fan of both playing and watching soccer and basketball, he was known for his ardent devotion to the Maccabi Tel Aviv team.\nIn a video memorial released by the kibbutz, his mother, Nurit, said, “Ilan was a very calm child, he had many friends, everyone wanted to be around him. He always liked to be surrounded by friends, he played soccer very well,” she said, so much so that he was scouted as a youth for a special training school, but she opted to allow him to decide if it was something he wanted to pursue later.\n“Ilan was very family-oriented, he spent time with his parents, his five siblings and his extended family,” she added, later choosing to raise his own family in the kibbutz.\nIn an interview for a podcast with Sapir College students about life in the south, which was only released after his death, Ilan described how he had been convinced to join the local security team despite initially resisting: “OK, fine, this is how we were raised here, to give, to donate, in whatever way we can.”\nWhen he got married, he recounted, the couple decided “to continue living here in Nahal Oz… To raise kids in this reality is one of the best things you can give your children — the green surroundings, the pluses outweigh the minuses.”\nHis wife, Sharon, said Ilan was a man who loved life and loved the kibbutz.\n“Ilan enjoyed every day, every moment — he appreciated every day and minute in his life,” Sharon told Ynet. “He loved to go to Maccabi Tel Aviv games with his daughters, he loved to spend time with them, to take them to nursery and pick them up after — to be a dad 200% of the time.”\n“He loved music, every branch of sports, poker, he loved life,” she added. “The kibbutz was his life, the people on the kibbutz — he always thought of others.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He is survived by his parents, Ruth and Yehu, and his two older sisters Chen and Noy.\nHe attended the rave with his girlfriend, Shoham Turgeman, who was also slain that day, along with two of their friends, Shani Ben Ami and Eden Abdulayev. All four of them worked together at the 2c restaurant and bar in Tel Aviv, which is where Nir and Shoham first met. They traveled together to the festival and were all killed there.\nAfter finishing high school, Nir completed his mandatory military service at Bisla, the air defense school. Afterward, he moved to Tel Aviv and began working at the restaurant, managing its bar, and planning to study civil engineering, according to a eulogy.\nFriends and family said he loved to attend parties and festivals and to take part in extreme sports and outdoor adventures.\nWriting on Instagram, Gaya Lek, a friend of Nir and Shoham, noted that “from the moment they met until they were taken from us too soon they did not part for a moment.” The couple, she wrote, “were a true match, from the depths of their souls, just like in fairy tales. A once-in-a-lifetime kind of love.”\nThe pair “loved to celebrate life, to laugh and dance and be happy… We’ll remember them always in our hearts and we’ll never forget.”\nNir’s sister, Chen, wrote on Facebook, “The world has lost a huge and good soul like no other — I love you forever, rest in peace.” Noy wrote that Nir was “the most beautiful gift in my life for such a short time — you will be in my heart forever!”\nHis mother, Ruth, wrote that she “wants to go back to October 6.

    "story": "Yossi (Zigi) Aptalon, 77, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in his home in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7.\nBoth he and his beloved dog, Elvis, were shot dead inside his home in the kibbutz. His body was not identified for two weeks.\nYossi was buried in Kibbutz Revivim in a temporary burial on October 26. He is survived by his four children, Netta, Zohar, Adi and Tomer, and 13 grandchildren: Shani, Amit, Hadas, Nahar, Goma, Aline, Nir, Shahar, Maayan, Ela, Yoel, Omri and Gili. His wife, Roni, died in 2021.\nBorn Zigmund aka Zigi in Kazakhstan in 1946, he moved to Israel with his parents at age 4, where he grew up in Yaffo, according to a kibbutz eulogy. He served as a signaller in the army, where he met his future wife, Roni. During a vacation together to Eilat while they were dating, they suffered a bad car accident, in which Yossi lost his left arm.\nIn the 1980s, after already establishing their own graphics company and having three daughters, they moved to Kibbutz Be’eri, where they had a fourth child and both began working at the famed Be’eri printing press. The couple were known for their love of culture, music, art and literature, something they worked to instill in their children. In later years, Yossi studied social work and worked in education, the kibbutz said, and was also heavily involved in organizing the Be’eri archive, as well as exploring and documenting his own family history.\nYossi’s childhood friend, Avraham Noy, noted on Facebook that their friendship dated back to the 1950s as schoolboys in Yaffo. They later worked together briefly when Zigi started his own business, and though their professional partnership was short, he said, they maintained a 65-year friendship.\nOn what would have been Yossi’s 78th birthday, Avraham noted that he could not call his longtime friend as he always used to: “I miss you, my dear friend, I feel your loss so much… My dear Zigi, thank you for being such an important part of my life. I hope that all of the big tribe you left behind, your four children and your grandchildren, treasure inside them a big part of your good qualities that made you such a special person.”\nHis grandson, Nahar, told Ynet, “My grandfather really was a good and unique person… He really loved music, he had a huge record collection. In recent years he also really loved to paint.”\nHis daughter, Netta, eulogized her father on Facebook, writing that she was trying to remember not his violent death, but “all of your great character traits, your devotion, diligence, love, free spirit, exacting nature, unique humor, your musical ear, the person that you were.”\nShe noted that with a uniquely timed “closure,” they had only just finished creating a memory book of her mother, Roni, two years after her death.\n“You were happy with the finished product and we were supposed to send it to print… it was so hard for you to part from her. You grew up and matured together — and you did everything you could to keep on going.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She wed Matan Goldman in 2022.\nA noted animal lover, her family and friends said she always sought to feed stray cats and dogs and to find homes for animals in need. In her memory, her parents donated bags of pet food to a Holon veterinary clinic to carry on her mission.\nAccording to a eulogy on the Holon municipal website, Katya focused on photography and film in her high school studies, played tennis for many years and completed her mandatory IDF service as a truck driver.

I miss our telepathic connection, the unique bond that above everything was always there. I miss your free spirit, your spontaneity, your dominant and standout personality that was impossible to overlook. I miss your scent, the light in your eyes, your touch, hug, kiss.

    "story": "Bar Shechter, 32, from Katzir, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while fleeing the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nBar, who went by the DJ stage name Syloopo, played one of the early sets at the desert rave — the second to appear on the “mushroom stage” after Matan “Kido” Elmalem. After wrapping up his set around 12:30 a.m., he stayed on to listen to the other artists as the night progressed. When the rocket fire began, he left in his car and headed north, but was shot dead by Hamas terrorists next to the Mefalsim junction, according to a eulogy on the National Insurance Institute website.\nHe was buried in the Sha’ar Menashe cemetery, not far from Katzir, in the north, on October 11. Bar is survived by his wife, Yaara, his two children, Sol, 8, and Rom, 11 months, as well as his parents, Sabine and Arie, and his brother Carmel.\nBar worked as a mover, but his true passion was music, something he pursued for many years, including DJing at events and recording his own tracks. At his funeral, as mourners shoveled dirt onto his grave, they played one of his trance tracks in the background.\nHis friend Itai Gedj wrote on Facebook that he could not come to terms with the news: “I don’t believe it, you went to play your music at a wild party” and did not come back.\n“Your rolling laughter is the strongest thing I remember from you,” he added. “In times of difficulty you would know how to lift yourself up and shine. I had so many laughs with you, so much truth came out of your mouth always, so much love in your heart. It doesn’t make sense that you’re not here. It hurts so much.”\nHis wife, Yaara, told Haaretz that Bar “was an amazing person… very sociable – accepting of everyone. He had ties with all kinds of people of different ages.”\nShe said he was also “an amazing father,” to both their shared son and his 8-year-old daughter from a past relationship, “he was a very present and involved father, really attentive. He always took care of the children and of everyone he loved.”\nHis true love, she said, was music, and “he was into trance styles like ‘dark’ and ‘tech,’ which are characterized by a very fast beat. But he also loved ‘forest music,’ which incorporates sounds from nature.”\nIn a Facebook post several weeks after he was killed, Yaara wrote a poem to “my fighter,” one who “wore a uniform of a smile, kind eyes and a hug… who used happy music and enveloping light and went to battle.”\n“My fighter didn’t believe in justice, because there is none — if there was, he would still be here,” she wrote. “My fighter believed in life, believed that light and dark exist, equally, side by side. My fighter was a teacher, and if we listen to him, we’ll learn, we’ll develop, we’ll blossom, and maybe we’ll love. But what’s for sure is that if we keep listening to him, we’ll cry, and then we’ll laugh, and we’ll simply live.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Sgt. Yaron Zohar, 19, a Golani Brigade soldier from Kiryat Ata, was killed on October 7 battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nHe and his comrades fought back against dozens of terrorists who tried to invade the IDF outpost next to Kibbutz Erez, along the northern border of the Gaza Strip. He managed to take out a number of the gunmen, before he was wounded by shrapnel from a mortar, dying shortly after on the battlefield.\nHe was buried on October 9 in Kiryat Ata. He is survived by his parents, Lihi and Ami, and his sisters Ofri, 23, and Guy, 13.\nHe was an active soccer player for most of his youth, including playing six years for the Hapoel Haifa youth team. At the same time, he was a devoted fan of the Maccabi Haifa professional team.\nHis aunt, Galit, told a sports news site that they would often go together to Maccabi Haifa games, making “a whole ceremony” of the occasion.\n“We’d get up with excitement… leave the house early: ‘Listen, I need to get there at least three hours before, to absorb the atmosphere,’ he would say. Just before we’d leave the house, he’d make sure everyone is outfitted in green, most importantly the scarves,” she recalled. “Walking from the parking lot to the stadium… entering the bleachers, with that special moment where you soak up the atmosphere before the start of the game… singing with friends and then the opening whistle.”\nHis younger sister, Guy, told Channel 14 that she heard from his comrades after his death that he was “a funny kid, that he was always there for them, that he always helped — a kid who was the best, he really was. Everyone who knew him said the same thing.” Guy said they had a “very strong relationship, we were really close, anytime he’d come home on weekends [from the army] we’d spend time together.”\nSpeaking to Army Radio, Yaron’s mother, Lihi said he was “a wonderful boy, a modest boy, introverted, gentle and pleasant — he never fought, never cursed, he was rarely ever angry.”\nFrom a young age, she said, “he had very high emotional intelligence, and as he grew up it only intensified. He was a boy who was a joy to raise, to grow up with, he didn’t fight with his sisters, didn’t argue.”\nShe said he began playing soccer at age 7 and was dedicated to the sport for a decade until at age 17 he decided to quit and focus fully on preparing for an army combat role. “He really wanted to be in an elite unit, so he swapped out soccer for other exercises.” Golani was not his dream, she said, but he grew to be happy there, “and they really saw him, even with his quiet [nature] and his introversion, he made his mark.”\n“He is so very very missed, he’s a wonderful kid, he was the glue of the family, the glue of his friends, one of the best soldiers,” she said, noting that he received several awards for excellence during the nine months he had been in the army. “That’s what I heard from everyone who came in here [during the shiva mourning period] — that he was one of the best if not the best in his company.”\nHis father, Ami, told Israel Hayom ahead of Memorial Day, more than six months after Yaron was killed, that he visits his son’s grave every day and speaks to him.\n“I talk to him all the time, he’s with me, even if he can’t answer me he’s with me,” said Ami. Despite the pain, he said, he has chosen life and is devoted to his two daughters: “Yaron was very connected to his sisters, when he would come home he would always play with his little sister, he was a child of love.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Yair Nifousy, 20, a sniper in the Paratroopers Brigade from Adi, died on November 1 from wounds he sustained while fighting in the northern Gaza Strip a day earlier.\nHis family was told by the IDF that Yair was shot in an accidental friendly fire incident. His parents said they hold no anger toward those involved and are comforted by the fact that he was killed by those who were seeking only to protect the State of Israel.\nHe was buried on November 2 in Adi, in northern Israel. He is survived by his parents, Iris and Moshe, and his siblings Yuval, Shahar and Yoav.\nFamily and friends said that Yair was always the life of the party, and had a wide circle of friends. He enjoyed being out in nature and was a dedicated fan of Maccabi Haifa, they said.\nOn October 7, he was called up to the front lines after being on a weekend break at home. He was sent to battle in Kibbutz Mefalsim and clear the area of Hamas terrorists. Several weeks later, Yair and his comrades were among the first troops to enter Gaza in the ground invasion, and he was killed a day later.\nIn an interview with Channel 14, his mother, Iris, said that Yair was “like his name,” which means “light up,” and he was born on Hanukkah, the festival of lights.\n“He lit up everywhere he went, the house, the family, his friends — a child who was all light, love, joy, a boy who smiled,” she said. “He was a boy with a lot of strength, a lot of joy, was quiet but had incredible charisma.” She said that before he entered Gaza, he was asked what he was afraid of, “and he said, ‘I’m scared to harm innocent people.'”\nHis father, Moshe, said that his son “loved life — his friends, parties, playing soccer, playing the trumpet, making art.”\nYair’s girlfriend, Roni Kushtai, told a local news outlet that they met two years ago and began dating seriously six months before he was killed, deciding to give it a shot despite the difficulties from them both being in the army.\nIn the beginning, she said, “I didn’t realize that behind the shy boy was a whole world. And then I fell in love with him because he was sensitive… he was accepting and loving with all his heart,” she said. “When we would sit with all his friends he was always the one who made everything happy and fun.”\nRoni said they had plans to fly together to South America to travel once they were both released from the army. Instead, she said, they never even got to celebrate his 21st birthday together, which was marked just three weeks after he was killed.\n“I’ll always remember his smile — there isn’t anyone who didn’t mention his smile, I would melt when I saw him,” she said. “You could never say no to that smile. His smile is with me everywhere. His approach to life was so optimistic and happy — I take a lot of strength from that and remember our final moments together when we spoke, our conversations, his hug. With one hug he could make me forget all the troubles in the world.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Adi Danan, 20, a squad commander in the Givati Brigade’s Tzabar Battalion, from Yavne, was killed battling Hamas terrorists in the northern Gaza Strip on October 31.\nAdi was among 11 soldiers from the same battalion who were killed when a Namer armored personnel carrier they were in was hit by an anti-tank guided missile fired by Hamas, the IDF said.\nHe is survived by his parents, Vered and Yaniv Reuven, his twin sister Linoy and younger sister Lior. He was buried on November in Yavne.\nFriends and family said Adi loved to play basketball, work out at the gym, and was highly driven to join an IDF combat unit.\nShir Levi, Adi’s aunt, told the Walla news outlet that he “was all heart. He had sparkling eyes like jewels, just like his name. He was always loving and hugging and was there for others.” He and his twin sister, she said, “were the best of friends in the world, he would always protect her and also his younger sister.”\nShir said nobody in the family saw Adi between October 7 — the start of the war — and when he was killed. He celebrated his 20th birthday on October 8, she said, and a few days before he was killed “he texted that he would stay safe and that he loved everyone.” In their final text exchange, she said, Adi wrote: “Don’t worry, our victory is already here — I promise you.”\nSpeaking to Channel 14 news, Adi’s mother, Vered, said he was “a boy with a wide heart, sensitive, he was loved by everyone and was a good friend. He was known for his big smile and his rolling laughter — and his shining and good eyes.”\nVered said Adi “loved music, he loved to sing in all sorts of languages even when he didn’t understand a word he was saying.” Her son was “Zionist, moral, he loved his homeland, he loved this country and he wanted to fight for it.”\nShe read on air from a final letter that Adi wrote to his father not long before he was killed: “Dad, I know you’ll tell me I’m an idiot and why am I writing things like this but ultimately I don’t decide what will be there — I’ll be the most careful I can be… I love you on a level you don’t even understand, and I ask you, as a request from me, watch over the family, be there for whoever needs you, put a smile on and lift up the family because you are its heart.”\nIn an interview with Channel 13 news, Adi’s twin sister, Linoy, said he was “the light of the house, he was a mama’s boy, he was spoiled, he had a wide smile — he always helped everyone.”\nLinoy said they fought all the time as children, but would always make up. In later years, “we moved on from hitting each other to telling stories and sitting and talking, and I’m the most proud of him in the world.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Yarin Efraim, 24, from Petah Tikva, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nYarin, together with Eden Ohayon and Orel Abohatzaira, was managing the bar at the festival and was killed while trying to escape after helping others first. One of the wait staff who managed to escape later said Yarin saved her by telling to hide in her car.\nHis mother, Orli, told Channel 14 that when the attack began that morning, he didn’t tell her that he was under attack from terrorists because he didn’t want to worry her. His family searched for him until they were told on Monday, October 9, that he had been killed.\nHe leaves behind his parents, brother, Eliran, and sister, Sarai.\nOn an Instagram page set up to memorialize Yarin, Orly wrote that he was caring and always thought of others before himself.\n“There were no limits to your giving and your love was endless,” she wrote, adding that he had a “smile that not one person doesn’t talk about or can forget.”\nShe wrote that Yarin called her and his father, Zion, every afternoon to ask them how work had been and that he was the “best uncle anyone could ask for” to his nieces and nephews.\n“You were a hopeless rascal that made us all feel like life was beautiful and full of joy, happiness, laughter, and nonsense,” she wrote.\n“You made my heart beat, and now it’s still, but I know you would want me to keep smiling, living, and coping. You would want me to be strong, and even though you were my strength, I promise to try.”\nYarin’s older sister, Sarai, shared her eulogy from Yarin’s funeral and wrote that he had been the perfect son who always took care of their parents and constantly made sure to help them when they needed it.\n“My little brother was the gift I got for my ninth birthday, the gift of my life. I was so happy to celebrate our birthdays together for 24 years,” she said, adding that she would never be able to celebrate their shared birthday again.\nShe also told the Bring Them Light October 7 remembrance project that Yarin had a beautiful voice and loved to sing and play the guitar.\nHis girlfriend, Tehilla, wrote that Yarin had the “most beautiful smile in the world” and that he always did everything he could to make her smile.\n“You told everyone that you wanted to marry me and for me to be the mother of your children. You promised that we would be together forever. Who knew that forever would be so short?” she wrote.\n“I just want one more hug from you, one last kiss, a few more jokes, a little more teasing.”\nTehilla’s sister, Tiferet, thanked Yarin for giving her sister a relationship “full of warmth, respect, deep love, laughter, fun, and limitless giving.”\nShe added that Yarin had become a part of their family in the three years he had dated Tehilla and had been like an uncle to her kids.\nLior, a childhood friend of Yarin’s, shared a memory from kindergarten of him standing on a swing and chanting loudly “I save the girls.”\n“Recently, I found out that Yarin saved people at the Supernova music festival and didn’t run away and it just made sense to me,” she wrote. “Just like in my memory, that’s what he grew up to do. From a young age, he knew that his calling was to save people.”\nMany more friends contributed to the page, describing a man with a big smile with whom they could always have fun but also deep conversations.\nYarin worked for a bar services company called Dream Bar together with Eden and Orel, who were killed with him.\nMany employees contributed to his Instagram page saying they were always happy to learn they would be working shifts with him and sharing stories of how he was always ready to help the staff at events he worked at no matter what.\nA few weeks after October 7, Dream Bar announced a special set of cocktails in memory of Yarid, Eden, and Orel that includes each of their favorite drinks.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Now I am sorry for every moment I wasted not being close to you. In these moments we understand how much everything is dwarfed and how much nothing really matters. I am comforted by the fact that we were in a good period, that we spoke, laughed, gossiped with each other.”\nAt least in your final moments, Hen added, “you were in Shay’s arms, who embraced and protected you until the last second, at least he loved you like in the movies, like you always dreamed you would have.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He is survived by his parents, Rinat and Ofer, and his siblings Omer, Adi, Idan and Amit.\nHis family was given the charred remains of a letter found on his body when he was killed, which he had written five days earlier.\n“I want to say thank you for raising me and educating me to be who I am and to where I got,” he wrote. “Who would have thought that I would have to write a goodbye letter. To my parents, I appreciate you so much even though sometimes it didn’t seem that way.”\nItay, who was killed two weeks before his 21st birthday, wrote to “all my friends and the people I knew in my life: Thank you for all the moments I had with you, all the hangouts and the laughter. Thanks to you I laughed endlessly. I love you like crazy. Aside from that, it’s important for me to say that I don’t regret for a moment enlisting in a combat unit — it’s the best thing I’ve done in my life.”\nHis family said he had big plans after his release from the army to become a tattoo artist, and to set up his own home studio for tattoos — and had already promised his friends that they would be his first clients.\nOn October 7, Itay was home on sick leave from the army, but insisted on returning to his unit with the start of the Hamas attack, even when his family wanted him to stay home. And while his family was deeply worried about his operations in Gaza, he was not afraid: “This is what I’ve been training for for three years,” he told his mother in their last phone conversation.\nItay’s uncle, Yaron, told Maariv that his nephew was “a talented artist, a prankster, funny, raised everyone’s spirits, a magical child.” Itay “respected his parents, respected everyone — just a wonderful kid. He followed his brother into Givati.”\nHis mother, Rinat, told a local news site, “Itay entered this world early and left it too soon,” noting that he was born several months premature — on her own birthday — weighing less than 1 kg, “but Itay was a fighter from the first moment.”\n“I want people to know that Itay was a boy with smiling eyes, he did only good in this world, he was loved by everyone and loved everyone,” Rinat said. “He was an artist, with talent and good hands, who loved sports and his family.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Moments later, a pick-up truck of terrorists drove by and shot dead all 13 travelers. Only the driver emerged alive.\nImages of the group of pensioners lying dead at the bus stop were among the first to circulate on the morning of the Hamas onslaught, shocking Israelis and the world with the brutality of the assault.\nValeri was buried in Dimona on October 12. He is survived by his three sons, Gadi, Alon and Steve, and two grandchildren. The Dimona municipality said he worked in a factory in Sderot.\nFamily and friends remembered Valeri as a devoted fan of Maccabi Tel Aviv and a dedicated family man, who came to Israel 30 years ago from the former Soviet Union to establish a life in Israel.\nA family friend, Galit Glikin, eulogized Valeri on Facebook as “the person with the most golden heart. My father’s closest friend, and an uncle to us from a young age when I still lived in Dimona. A beloved man, with a huge heart.”\nSteve, Valeri’s son, visited the site where his father and so many others were gunned down, a month after the attack, and told Channel 12 news that the family “still haven’t accepted that this happened — we feel that Dad is coming home any minute.”\nValeri’s son, Alon, told Ynet that his father was looking forward to the day trip to the Dead Sea, “to disconnect a little bit from work.”\n“Dad was probably the funniest person ever,” said Alon. “He got along with everyone and he had a big heart, we never saw him argue or fight with anyone, or say ‘no’ to anybody who asked him for anything.

    "story": "Dikla Arava, 51, and her son Tomer Arava Eliaz, 17, were slain during the Hamas attack on Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7.\nTerrorists stormed into the home of Noam Elyakim, Dikla’s longtime boyfriend, whose two daughters, Dafna, 15 and Ela, 8, were also home.\nThe terrorists cruelly forced Tomer at gunpoint to knock on the doors of their neighbors and try to convince them to come outside — all the while livestreaming their psychological and physical terror on Dikla’s Facebook page.\nUltimately Tomer, Dikla and Noam were slain, and the terrorists kidnapped Dafna and Ela to Gaza, where they were held captive for 51 days before being released as part of a truce deal on November 26.\nDikla and Tomer’s bodies were only discovered and identified more than a week after the attack, outside the kibbutz grounds. They were buried side by side on October 16 in Kfar Maimon. An IDF probe in January 2025 found that there is a high likelihood Dikla and Tomer were killed by IDF fire while they were being kidnapped by Hamas.\nDikla and Tomer are survived by their two other older children/siblings, Odin and Stav, and Tomer is also survived by his father, Ma’ayan.\nA eulogy from the kibbutz lauded Tomer, a student in 12th grade, for “acting with bravery in the face of the murderers who took him as a captive… Tomer acted calmly and with nobility at the gunpoint of the killers.” The teenager, the kibbutz said, was “a magical boy, an angel, a golden child with a good heart, full of joy for life.”\nHis friends and family noted his love of trance music and festivals, as well as his addiction to the gym and working out.\nOn an Instagram memorial page set up for Tomer, his sister, Odin, wrote there are “not enough words that can describe what a wonderful person you were.”\n“Thank you for everything you were to me, that you always worried about me and put me first, even on that horrible Saturday when you thought about me and checked if I was OK,” she wrote. “Thank you for opening your heart before me like you never did with anyone else. Thank you for recording our conversations which are now all I have left to make me smile again. My angel — you always wanted to be taller than me, and now you are in the highest place in heaven and looking down on me from above.”\nWeeks after she returned from captivity, Dafna wrote on Instagram that “my Tomer, I miss you so much, it’s hard for me without you. Until 135 days ago we would go to school together every day, and now I go to school alone every day.”\nIn April, Dafna wrote a message to Dikla, noting that it had been “196 days that I haven’t heard you, 196 days that I haven’t seen your smile in person and not in photos, 196 days that you are watching over me from above… I hope you are happy and joyful up there.”\nThe kibbutz eulogy for Dikla noted that she ran the education system for Nahal Oz, and in later years was an educational consultant for preschools.\n“Dikla was full of life, loved to dance, to be happy, was a warrior mother for her children,” the eulogy noted. “Her charming smile and laughter will be missed in all of our meetings.”\nMaayan Zin, Noam’s ex-wife and the mother of Dafna and Ela, wrote on Facebook that Dikla “loved my daughters so much and my girls loved Dikla so much.”\nShe said that Dafna and Dikla “connected immediately — Dafna loved her from the first minute they met, they would swap shoes, put on makeup and laugh, Dikla was so present in her life.” Ela, she said, “doesn’t know any life without Dikla. Without Dikla’s family.”\n“So yes, Dikla is the new girlfriend, but what Dikla gave to Dafna and Ela and Noam nobody can take away from her,” added Maayan. “I just hope she didn’t suffer in her final moments.”\nShalev Zarka, who is married to Dikla’s niece, noted in a eulogy at the funeral that when he joined the family five years earlier, “I heard so many stories about you, and when we met we fell in love in a moment.”\n“Aunt Diki, I love you so much. You were a listening ear to me at any time of day — every phone call from you, every cigarette with you by the fish pond was an experience I will never forget,” he said.\n“And Tomer — ‘Tomer the king’ — that’s how you are written in my phone,” Shalev continued. “You were the king in my eyes. Determined in every task, working out like crazy, we would compete in the gym — and you at age 17 would crush me every time. I will take your determination to reach every goal and stand by it. The desire to be the best at everything you wanted to be.”\n“Tomer, even in your final moments, when we saw you facing the terrorists, you were such a warrior. Determined and composed. I love you so much.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He is survived by his mother, Suzy, his older sister Yehudit and younger siblings Tzila, Gadit, Yitzhak and Natan.\nBorn in Morocco, his family left when he was a baby, and arrived in Israel via France, according to an obituary on the National Insurance Institute website. He grew up in Sderot, and after his mandatory military service he studied accounting at Sapir College in the city, and later in life also studied in the health field, particularly nutrition.\nHis family noted that he was named Amram, and called Ami, after his grandfather, Amram, who was murdered inside the supermarket he owned in Morocco in 1957 in a hate crime. Toledano often found it difficult to hold such a name, they said, and later in life opted to go by Alon.\nHe was an active member of Havruta, an organization of religious gay Israelis. The organization noted that only a few weeks before he was killed, he completed the training necessary to volunteer with its hotline — but never got to man his first shift.\nHis nephew, Shlomo Kavas, wrote on social media that Alon “was a kind and very sensitive man. His life was not always easy, physically and mentally, but he never gave up on improving it.” Shlomo noted that he was a “loving uncle to his nieces and nephews and a dedicated son.”\nIn an interview on a Kan podcast, Havruta activists Netanel Shaler and Shay Bramson noted that Alon only decided to come out of the closet around five years before he was killed and “to come to terms with his identity.”\nIn his memory, Shaler said, Havruta is establishing a project to give special assistance to any of its members harmed or affected physically and psychologically from the October 7 attack and the ensuing war.\nBramson noted that Alon “remained very religious” and hailed from a very religious family, and kept those elements of his identity fairly separate.\nAlon, he said, “was a very modest person, very humble, very quiet, but always volunteered to help,” and that he seemed very happy with to take part in Havruta’s range of communal activities — “you could see that it did him good.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She is survived by her parents, Asya and Ivgeni, and her sister Maya.\nShe had enlisted in the military just a few months before she was killed. Karin attended a specialized high school in Tel Aviv that was designed to prepare her for a career in the Air Force. In a video several years before she was killed, she joked that in 10 years she would want to be the first “female IDF chief of staff.”\nWhile in high school she volunteered at an animal shelter, as well as with the nonprofit Krembo Wings, which serves children with special needs around the country. In a post on Facebook, Krembo Wings noted that Karin was “a central figure in the [Holon] branch thanks to her big and wide smile, pleasant aura, openness and professionalism… she entered everyone’s hearts.”\nLishay Esh, who worked at Karin’s high school, described her as “pure hearted, all one big heart. I was privileged that you were part of my life, I was privileged that you love me and I love you. I was privileged to see you every day for years, my good girl, we spoke so much about your future” and her decision to study for two more years before enlisting. “You told me that life was long… they took you from me, those monsters, before you got to accomplish your dreams.”\nKarin was a noted animal lover, in particular cats, and her family and friends have sought to memorialize her in that way. At the elementary school she attended, pupils made cartons into cat feeders and placed them around Holon in her memory.\n“From a young age, Karin loved animals, cats and dogs, and wanted to feed them at every opportunity,” her mother, Asya, told Ynet. “When we flew abroad she would always go around with a bag of dry food in case she met a hungry cat.”\nAsya noted that Karin drew two little cats in a love letter she wrote to Amit, and that drawing has since been tattooed on a number of family and friends in the couple’s memory.\n“Karin loved to draw all the time, in classes and lectures, this was how she would focus,” said Asya, noting that her husband as well as Amit’s mother tattooed the image of the cats, “and I tattooed a different drawing of hers.

    "story": "Apichart Kusaram, 29, and his brother Phongthep Kusaram, 26, from the Nong Song Hong district in Khon Kean province in northern Thailand, were murdered by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7.\nBoth brothers were working as farmhands on the kibbutz and were among the 11 Thai nationals slain when Hamas terrorists attacked their living quarters on the outskirts of Nir Oz.\nKurat Kha-Fluan, a Thai laborer who survived the attack on the kibbutz, told Ma’ariv that “I’ll never forget the terrifying and horrible moments when the Hamas came to our shelter, and starting shooting in every direction — I mostly remember chaos and confusion,” he said, noting that he had blocked out “some of the details, the moments when I saw my friends murdered in front of my eyes.”\nPhongthep’s body was returned to Thailand on October 20 for a cremation ceremony; Apichart’s body arrived in his homeland on October 26. They are survived by their father and older brother, and Apichart is also survived by his wife and two young children.\nIn a report in Thai PBS World, the father of the two young men, Lampieu Kusaram, wept as he recounted that his sons were first reported as missing, and “at that time, I still had hope that my children had survived the attack.”\nRegardless of any sort of compensation he receives from the Thai or Israeli governments, he said, “it could not compensate for my loss and grief.”\nThe father said that Pongthep, who was single, went to Israel first, and then persuaded Apichart — who was married with two children — to follow him there. While they were living there, Lampieu said, they were in regular contact with the family and had promised to buy him a tractor with their earnings.\nPongthep, who arrived in Israel in mid-2021, regularly posted snippets of his life in Israel on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok — showing him working in the fields, harvesting fruits, spending relaxation time with his fellow farmhands and also sharing screenshots of the money transfers he was sending back home.\nAt times he wrote about missing his family back in Thailand, posted photos from outings to a bowling alley in Kfar Saba, shared images of the fields, chicken coops and dairy farm of Nir Oz, and above all spoke of his desire to provide financially for his family.\nIn a post in March 2023, six months before he was killed, Pongthep wrote: “If I could ask for anything this year — I’m not asking for much… as long as I have a healthy body, no sickness, I can go to work every day as I want. My goals and life plans are all planned out. I just have to follow the path I set.”\nApichart’s wife, Kwanchanok Chomchuen, told the Khaosod English news site that “on the morning of October 7, my husband sent me a message that there was fierce fighting in the area.

I could not reach him.”\nOnly two days later, she said, did she find out that both Apichart and Pongthep had been killed.\n“I feel both sadness and compassion for my 4-year-old daughter. Since her father went silent, she has begged to be able to call him every day. All I could tell her was that her father had to work and could not call,” she told the news outlet.\nThe website later reported that when his body arrived back in Thailand, the girl “cried and demanded to see her father.” After breaking the news, the news outlet said, “She hugged her mother, cried and then fell silent.”\nAt his cremation ceremony, Kwanchanok said: “If my husband is listening, I want to tell you that you don’t have to worry about your children.

    "story": "Ido Edri, 24, from small Moshav Gibton near Rehovot, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nIdo, an operative with the Shin Bet agency, was unarmed during the rave, but immediately sprang into action when the terrorist invasion began, according to survivors. He guided people to the exits, working with security guards and police officers who were at the scene and treated the wounded, including Bar Zohar, who ultimately succumbed to her wounds.\nThe last known photograph taken of Ido alive shows him treating a wounded partygoer next to a vehicle. His friends said Ido refused to leave the site of the party even when they begged him to, choosing to stay behind and try to assist in any way he could. All of the friends he attended the rave with managed to survive.\nSpeaking at a Memorial Day ceremony, his father said Ido was “a charming young man, a lover of people and the land,” who fought against the Hamas invasion of the rave “until his last breath.” Shortly before 9 a.m., he said, he spoke on the phone with Ido, “and I understood that the worst of all had happened, I knew the situation was severe, I heard the distress in his voice, I knew I couldn’t help him.”\nHis body was identified a day after the attack. He was buried on October 8 in Rehovot. He is survived by his parents, Reut and Hanan, and his younger siblings Yonatan and Tamar.\nAccording to a eulogy on the Shin Bet website, Ido began his mandatory military service in 2017 and served in the Golani Brigade, eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant and the position of deputy commander of Golani’s 13th Battallion.\nHe had only begun working in the Shin Bet at the start of 2023. The agency said even from the beginning “Ido exhibited high self-discipline, very good professional capabilities, seriousness, a strong work ethic, and a deepening and exciting motivation to be exposed to new worlds and to develop in the agency.” His superiors said, “Ido stood out as a social leader, aware of his surroundings, responsible and modest — who made sure to help and be there for his friends and colleagues.”\nHis friends recalled him playing basketball as a child, being the funniest of their group, and loving to let loose and party on the weekends.\nIdo’s close childhood friend, Adi Taub, wrote on Facebook that their friend WhatsApp group is called “Ido Edri’s friends,” because “you are the center, the key.”\n“You are a man of parties, a man of enjoyment; you set yourself goals and you crushed all of them. Your laughter is contagious, your smile is embracing, you are the person who made me laugh the most, and calibrated me the most.”\nIn a post on what would have been his 25th birthday, Ido’s mother, Reut, noted that he would usually celebrate with a huge party, “because you’d never dream of not having your million friends.”\n“In your life, you brought me complete and total joy, true love and a rare bond between mother and son including hours of deep conversations and revelations,” she wrote. “In your modest, quiet and kind way, you knew with your maturity to have my back and be my island of confidence and endless pride.”\n“You were a huge light in the life of so many people,” Reut continued. “I wish I could shower you with endless gifts and love and treats today. You loved treats so much, you loved life so much — you just loved so much.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She is survived by her parents, Lital and Moshe, and her younger brother Itay.\n“Shira my beloved daughter, throughout every path in your life I was always amazed by your ability to deal with complicated situations,” her father, Moshe, wrote on Facebook alongside an audio clip of one of her final missives over the army’s two-way radio. “Even after your death you continue to amaze me, and to teach me what bravery is.”\n“When I hear the recordings of your radio reports, I am filled with pride — my Shira, I am proud of who you were in life and I am proud of who you are in death.”\nBorn in the small moshav of Srigim, Shira and her family moved to Modiin when she was three. She enlisted in the army in early 2023 to begin her mandatory service, and her family said she enjoyed serving as an observation soldier along the Gaza border, and was even considering enrolling in an officer’s course.\nFamily and friends said that Shira loved the sea — which matched her bright blue eyes — including scuba diving and swimming, and loved to travel abroad, going on many trips with her family. She also had a close connection to the family dog, Lolly.\nHer close friend, Roni Levy, wrote on Instagram about how they met at the start of high school and became fast friends.\n“Whenever I needed help, you were there for me, and it’s not taken lightly,” she wrote. “I’ll never forget that due to your insistence that we sit and study we managed to pass our matriculation exams. I always knew that when we got to the army we would stay the best of friends… I miss you so much, you don’t even know how much, I miss our deep conversations, our laughter, our dreams, I want to tell you every little thing that happens to me in life and I feel your absence so much.”\nHer family established an initiative in her name to assist freshly released soldiers in finding and developing a career path, saying it represented her personality and dreams.\n“Shira demonstrated throughout her life outstanding and unique character traits which led her to realization, success, dealing with challenges and finding the potential that was within her,” her mother, Lital wrote.\nMarking five months since she was killed, her mother said that Shira was “present in our lives, every single moment.”\n“We speak about you, we speak to you, we laugh about you, we laugh with you,” she wrote. “You’re felt every moment, we are living you, our daughter. You left us down here, looking for signs from you and sometimes finding them. You are in every corner and every flower, in every sunset and every moment.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

It wasn’t until a week later that he was identified and his family was told he had been killed.\nItamar and 12 others from the 13th battalion — including the outpost commander, Cpt.

He is survived by his wife, Sharona, their four children Ilay, 19, Imer, 16, Einan, 14 and Emanuel, 6, his parents, Dominique and Motti, and his siblings Gilad, Shahar and Tom.\nHis wife, Sharona, told Haaretz that when Ran realized the kibbutz had been invaded by terrorists, he took his son’s army rifle and loaded it with ammo. Through their locked door he shot at several of them, who fled, and then later shot at another group who were trying to enter through the window.\n“This was Ran,” she said. “He wanted to fight them face to face and refused to enter the reinforced room.”\nHours later, she recounted, Ran heard a group of soldiers outside shouting “terrorist, terrorist,” and he ran to the balcony to shoot at the figure, but the group of soldiers saw him and thought he was the terrorist, opening fire and killing him immediately.\n“I screamed ‘Ran, Ran, Ran,’ and I crawled toward him. He was lying on his back in a puddle of blood. I gave him mouth-to-mouth but it was clear that he was dead,” Sharona recounted.\nRan’s father, Motti, told the newspaper that they “are not angry at anyone, the soldiers did their job and risked their lives. Unfortunately it cost us the life of our firstborn and beloved son, Ran, who was killed while protecting his home and his family.”\nAt his family’s request, he was recognized by the Defense Ministry two weeks after his death as a fallen soldier with the rank of sergeant major in the reserves.\nRaised in Yavne, Ran served as a tank commander in the IDF’s 401st Brigade during his mandatory military service, then studied criminology and sociology at Bar Ilan University, where he met Sharona. The couple moved to Nahal Oz in 2015, and Ran worked as a dockworker at the Ashdod Port.\nA eulogy from the kibbutz noted that Ran “loved to travel around Israel, to hike challenging paths, to bake sourdough bread and cook meat.”\nIn an interview with Yediot Aharonot in 2018, Ran described life in the kibbutz as a “slice of paradise.”\n“The decision to live in this area was brewing for a few years,” he added. “It’s a pastoral location, beautiful, with an incredible community.”\nHis friend Inbar Madmon Gamliel wrote on Facebook thanking Ran for “all you were (and all you did!) for everyone.”\n“The first to help, to lend a shoulder, with your wit up until your last moment, the smile that was always on your face, the respect you made sure to give everyone,” she wrote. “The trips, the meals, the breads… I promise you that the way you were always there for us, we will be for Sharona and the kids.”\nIn a video testimony, Sharona noted that Ran was “always cool” in emergencies and had a unique sense of humor.\n“Ran would always joke about everything, there was nothing he wouldn’t poke fun at,” she said, noting even during the events of October 7, he said they might as well prepare jachnun — “if we’re going to die, we might as well die full.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was buried in Rehovot on October 12.\nEla told ABC news in an interview that she was told by authorities her father was shot and then set on fire. “I’m holding on to the hope with all my heart that he died from being shot… His house wasn’t burned, I know that he was taken out of his house after he was shot because I’ve seen the blood… I just want to hope that he was dragged out when he was no longer alive. I just want to hope it was quick.”\nShe told the news anchor that her father “was a good man, and I think everyone knew it… I’m really proud of who he was, being his daughter, and I loved him.”\nAccording to a kibbutz eulogy, Itizk was born in Israel a few years after his parents, both Holocaust survivors, arrived in the Jewish state with his older sister, Pnina. His parents did not speak much about their wartime experiences, but his father lost his entire family in the Holocaust, including his first wife and his son.\nWhen he was 8, Itzik’s mother died of cancer. At age 16, he arrived at Kibbutz Be’eri with a wave of youth pioneers. For several decades, he worked in farming, before at age 40 moving to work in the famed Be’eri printing press, where he stayed until retirement. His sister, Pnina, died in 1997.\nHis niece, Ganit Marinberg, shared on Facebook a eulogy written by her father, Rafi, Itzik’s brother-in-law, to the man “I knew for more than five decades.”\nHe recalled first meeting him in the 1970s when you were “a young handsome soldier in the Nahal Parachute Battalion, tall, good looking with a masculine voice… you loved kibbutz life, and as soon as you were able you left your father’s home with a group of other youth and tied your fortunes to the kibbutz where you met your tragic death.”\n“My dear brother-in-law, I will no longer have the chance to grumble about the brother-in-law who saw the world differently than me and lived in another world, I won’t be able to enjoy the cholent served in the cafeteria on Shabbat,” he added. “I won’t get to encounter those wonderful people who were your good and loyal friends for your whole life.”\nAdi Zohar, the daughter of Haim Zohar, who was also slain in Be’eri, noted that to the extended Zohar clan, “you were more than family, you were always part of us.”\n“Together with my father… You both arrived at the kibbutz without any family, and became family by choice to each other, and were never parted — even in death,” wrote Adi, on what would have been Itzik’s 73rd birthday.\n“To us, you were a friend, an uncle and sometimes, especially in the last few years, a father,” she added. “We could talk to you about anything. You knew everybody and it was the most fun to gossip with you. You’d always throw in an old-fashioned joke, tell us about another childhood memory of ours, another story about you and Dad from the glory days. You were significant to us and to so many others and I hope you knew that.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Yonadav Raz Levenstein, 23, a soldier in the Givati Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, was killed while fighting Hamas in the northern Gaza Strip on November 3.\nHe grew up in Ma’ale Adumim, the child of Canadian immigrants, and lived in Jerusalem. He was killed just two months after his wedding to Hadar.\nYonadav was buried on November 5 on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. He is survived by his wife, Hadar, his mother Leora and and his five older siblings, Merav, Elnatan, Atara, Tzahala and Avital. He was predeceased by his father, Michael.\nYonadav’s tall stature and striking red beard led many of his friends and comrades to refer to him as “the viking.” He met his wife, Hadar, while the two were working at the City of David archeological digs before he enlisted in the army — something he had to fight for after getting into trouble in his high school years.\nEnlisting at age 21, Yonadav fought his way to the Givati Brigade, and on October 7 his unit was called to the front lines, where they battled against Hamas in Kibbutz Nir Oz. Several weeks later, he was among the first troops to enter Gaza with the start of the ground invasion.\nOn October 24, Yonadav sent a message to his newlywed wife via the Walla news site, taking the microphone while stationed on a base in the south and saying simply: “Hi, I’m Yonadav Levenstein from Jerusalem, I want to say hi to my wife, Hadar — I love you very much.”\nFamily and friends of Staff Sgt. Yonadav Raz Levenstein, an IDF soldier killed in Gaza, mourn at his funeral at the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem on November 5, 2023. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nYonadav was remembered as having a wide range of hobbies, including music — playing the piano, guitar and harmonica — being talented at basketball, a keen student of history and having a love of hiking and travel. When they were first dating, Hadar and Yonadav hiked the Israel Trail together, and had plans for a global honeymoon once he was released from the army.\nAt his funeral, his mother, Leora, noted that despite being the youngest of six, “you grew up to be an independent boy, teen and man, smart, opinionated, strong and hardworking — but always with the warmest and sweetest smile in the world and the biggest heart.”\nThree years earlier, she said, when Yonadav’s father was “on his deathbed, he made sure to say how proud he was of you for the path you set for yourself. He was happy with your work in the City of David excavations, where you combined your impressive physical strength with your love for Jewish history and your deep understanding and knowledge in all areas connected to the heritage of the Jewish people.”\nAnd there, she noted, was where he met Hadar, “and what a wise and mature choice you made when you decided she would be your partner for life… such a beautiful couple, connected by a unique covenant of love, complementing each other in divine harmony.”\nSpeaking to the Makor Rishon newspaper, Hadar described her husband as a “sort of huge viking with the soul of a child.”\n“He was a fascinating conversationalist, so interesting and measured,” she recalled of their early days working together at the City of David. “Yonadav truly loved the Land of Israel and its history, and knew so much… he was an autodidact, he taught himself to play the piano, the guitar, the harmonica, he was a super talented musician. When we would visit his mother, he would hug her and immediately sit down to play songs with me next to him — I miss that.”\nEnlisting at a slightly older age, she said, made him a big brother and leader figure to many of his comrades, who came to pay their condolences during the shiva.\n“Like in life, also in the army, for all the complicated tasks he was the first,” she said. “They always knew they had someone to rely on, and knew that there was someone here who came to work.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

The family sat shiva for Tamir.\nOn the morning of October 7, Tamir set out to support the kibbutz’s local security team when news of the invasion began to arrive. He told his wife and children to stay locked in their reinforced room. His grandmother, Yaffa Adar, was also kidnapped that day — immortalized in one of the most enduring images of the attack — and released 48 days later.\nTamir is survived by his wife, Hadas, children Asaf, 7, and Neta, 3, his parents Yael and Moshe, and three siblings, Nir, Inbar and Roni, as well as several grandparents.\nA notice from the kibbutz announcing his death noted that he was a “family man, who loved nature and people. He was a devoted fan of Maccabi Tel Aviv and was always surrounded by friends.”\nHis cousin, Adva Adar, wrote on Facebook: “Tamush, your smile will continue to light the way for us. Thank you for fighting until you couldn’t anymore in a battle that was lost from the start. You protected the kibbutz, your family and the home you loved so much. I’m sorry it ended this way.”\nHis brother, Nir, noted that on Tamir’s front door, was a sticker which read “There is no grumbling here — we just say thank you and charge ahead with life.” The sticker, Nir wrote on Facebook, “feels like he left me his final wishes. I hope I will succeed and I promise to try.”\nIn the past, Tamir worked for the Ramon Foundation — established in the memory of Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon to encourage youth to explore science and aviation — as a social leader in a local school. The foundation described him as a “role model and source of inspiration. He worked with great dedication, and invested deep thought in every process, becoming a significant figure not just for the kids but for all of us.”\nIn recent years, he left to work in agriculture in Nir Oz, which had always been his lifelong dream, his family said.\nHe was born and raised in Nir Oz, wrote his mother in Maariv, “a third generation in the kibbutz, a farmer, an educator, who loved the land and the people.”\nSince the news of his death, she wrote, “We have been doing everything in our power to bring Tamir home to be buried here, in the land he loved, the land of Nir Oz. Tamir is worthy of this. Tamir believed that he was doing the right thing because we are all responsible for each other.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Yuri worked for close to 20 years for the Israel Nature and Parks Authority.\nAt a Memorial Day ceremony in the Knesset in 2024, the couple’s son, Mark, recounted seeing Hamas terrorists open fire at his parents as they were all trying to get to a bomb shelter amid the sirens and rockets.\n“My father fell, his cane flew, and my mother was in shock, didn’t understand what was happening, and they shot mom too,” he said.\nMark said he wanted to run and try and save them, but “I saw that was it, there were no signs of life.” He ran with other neighbors to the nearby bomb shelter and tried to close and lock the door, but a terrorist stuck his weapon in the hinge to prevent it from closing, said Mark.\nHe managed to get it closed, and the terrorist fired inside the shelter’s air vent, but couldn’t get inside. After 8.5 hours, he said, everyone in the shelter was rescued by Israeli forces. Mark recounted seeing his parents’ bodies after he emerged, “and I wanted to just go with them. I didn’t want to live anymore.”\n“They were good people, simple people,” he said. “They never did anything bad to anyone… they devoted their lives to generosity, to love.”\nIn a video released by a Buchari communal group, he recalled that every day when he would come home from work “my mother would be waiting for me with a smile on her face. She would give me a hug all the time, every morning, all the time she would be blessing me, always telling me ‘thank you that I have you.'”\nHis father he said, “felt that he found a home here [in Israel]. He was a simple man, with a smile on his face, always smiling. Everyone knew him, everyone in the city knew him.”\nThe couple, he said, would sit every evening on a bench in the city square and greet passersby, often handing out candy.

She was previously a social coordinator at Bayit Shel Tamar, [Tamar’s Home] an organization that helps children with learning difficulties.\nThe Moringa Israel website now includes a memorial page for Maya, describing her as “a family woman, a pioneering entrepreneur.

    "story": "Sgt. Shimon Yohai Lugasi, 19, a surveillance balloon operator in the Border Defense Corps’s 414th unit, from Acre, was killed on October 7 while battling Hamas terrorists at the Nahal Oz IDF outpost.\nShimon was one of five balloon operators on duty that fateful morning, who were waiting for a repair crew to arrive and fix the malfunctioning balloon when the Hamas invasion began. Instead, they began to fight back against the terrorists, but heavily outnumbered, all five were killed in the battle.\nShimon is survived by his parents, Rachel and Michel, and his siblings Daniel, Yael, Oriel and Noa. He was buried on October 12 in Nahariya.\nShimon had only joined the IDF six months before he was killed, and he had worked to lose weight in order to be placed in a more prestigious position, his family said. He grew up in a religious home and was noted for his strong faith and observance, and was also a devoted fan of the Beitar Jerusalem soccer club.\nA memorial Instagram page set up for him noted that he was born on the holiday of Hanukkah, “and you were always the light at home and for everyone.”\n“What you did in 19 years, people who are 70 or 80 did not accomplish,” the memorial post continued. “You brought us huge pride when you achieved everything you wanted, to protect this country and our land and the citizens here — we are alive because of people like you, our angel. We hope that you are in a good place and you are smiling your smile that never left your face.”\nShimon’s girlfriend, Linoy, wrote on Instagram that she last saw him on October 4, three days before he was killed when he fought to get a brief break “to give me your final hug… you didn’t hold back one hug or kiss on that Wednesday.”\nLinoy wrote that the couple were so looking forward “to you finishing the army and me finishing my studies and we would take the trip we always dreamed of. And after? We would only start our lives together as a married couple and establish a holy home with children running between our legs… my love, we dreamed of so many things together but now they will always remain a dream that was cut short.”\nA month after he was killed, his brother, Oriel, wrote on Instagram that he is still “shattered into pieces.”\n“I pray to God that you will come back and wake me up from this nightmare,” he wrote. “I miss our laughter and our fights so much, I have nobody to fight with, I’m bored without you — really I am nothing without you, you would always complete me in everything.”\nHis father, Michel, said in a video that “Shimon was a wonderful kid. Shimon was a righteous man.”\nIn his eulogy at his funeral, Michel noted that he did not express any anger, “but the opposite, I said, ‘Thank you God for the 20 years that you gave me Shimon.'” He was a “boy who did only good, who had the most incredible respect for his parents,” he said, noting that he worked as a teenager as a waiter and would always give his earnings to his father to help the family.\nMichel said that Shimon would often walk around wrapped in the Israeli flag. “He had a love for others, he didn’t care who they were, if they were Jewish or Arab, if they needed anything they would get it… ‘love they neighbor as yourself,'” he said.\n“Despite everything, despite the difficulties, and we had difficulties, he was always happy,” his father added. “He was always happy.

Nissim said the terrorists threw grenades inside, which blinded him in one eye and knocked him unconscious. When he awoke, he said, Laurie was not there, and he understood that she had left the shelter to get air due to the heavy smoke.\nNissim said he went out to look for her, and found her shot dead, lying with her eyes open just outside the bomb shelter. He said he made the difficult decision to leave her body behind and escape with his life.\nLaurie was buried on October 12 in Ra’anana. She is survived by her parents, Racheli and Dominic, and her siblings Ariel and Eitan.\nNissim said the couple were so looking forward to Supernova, in part because “Laurie worked every weekend… She was such a hardworking woman, she was prepared to do everything to reach her endless goals,” he wrote on Instagram.\n“My Laurie, the crazy love I had for you has only increased 10-fold since October 7, 2023,” he wrote. “You gave so much light to those around you. So many people smiled with you, laughed and enjoyed your silliness. The sweetest silliness in the world. On the other hand, you’re incredibly smart, full of charisma and high self-esteem, one who knows how to achieve everything her heart desires. Truly, everything. You have a villa in my heart… and it will stay there forever.”\nLaurie and Nissim lived together in Herzliya with their two beloved dogs, Chelsea and Quick. Her friends said she loved sweets, in particular chocolate, and had a soft spot for warm chocolate souffle. She was a huge fan of the band Coldplay, and even had a tattoo of their lyrics, “Look at the stars, look how they shine for you,” from their song “Yellow.”\nShe worked at a number of jobs, including as a personal trainer, at a beauty salon and modeling. She also loved racecar driving, and even got a special license to do so on a closed course in the south.\nHer close friend, Shahaf Bar Siman Tov, wrote on Instagram that Laurie “is definitely dancing up there, I’m sure of it, my sister.”\n“I miss calling you, seeking your advice on every bit of nonsense, laughing and going crazy like only we knew how,” she added. “Eating chocolate and gummy candies with you until our stomach hurt, and just being with you, next to you. You will be my best friend forever, and I know that you are watching over me and taking care of me from up there.”\nOn Passover, her mother, Racheli, noted that a year earlier, “Lauritush and I celebrated Seder night by the book, we read the whole Haggadah, we understood it, we searched on Google what we didn’t understand, we passed the Seder plate over our heads like Moroccans do… we ate, we laughed.”\n“Why is this night different from all other nights?

The couple sent a video clip of themselves hiding in the trash bins, the last anyone saw them alive. Several days later, their bodies were recovered and identified.\nThe engaged couple, who met in high school, were buried side by side in Petah Tikva on October 10. Across their joint headstone it reads, “in life and death they did not part.”\nMaya is survived by her parents, Michal and Laurent, her younger sister Noa and little brother Gavriel.\nEliran is survived by his parents, Hofit and Haim, and his younger siblings Liem, Ofek and Tali.\nMaya and Eliran got engaged in August during a trip to Santorini, Greece, just over a month before they were killed, and had already set a date for their wedding: September 12, 2024.\nDuring her mandatory military service, Maya worked as a shooting instructor, and after finishing the army she spent five months traveling around South America, before returning and beginning her studies in education. Her family said she had a sweet tooth and loved chocolate and gummy candies.\nEliran served in the Shimshon Battalion in the Kfir Brigade during his mandatory military service, ultimately rising to become a platoon commander. After his release, he began working for an insurance company, and his family said he had plans to become a real estate agent. Eliran loved singing, motorcycles and extreme sports, his family said, and missed Maya so much when she went on her trip that he quit his job to join her partway through.\nHis mother, Hofit, told a memorial page that “Eliran was always happy and loved life. His father would say that ‘even when he wasn’t fully smiling, he always looked like he had a smile on his face.’ Eliran always took care of those around him before he took care of himself.”\nShe said he was always a caring big brother, “always knew what was going on with each of them all the time and always asked how he could help.” His relationship with Maya, she added, “was full of mutual love, and Eliran was always a gentleman and put her first — in hard times he would say to her ‘as long as I’m with you, everything will be OK.'”\nMaya’s sister, Noa, wrote on Facebook on what would have been Maya’s 23rd birthday to “my keeper of secrets, my laughter, my anger and my smile.”\n“I believe that you’re definitely organizing a party up there, with all of the angels of the Supernova and grandpa who was waiting for you there,” she wrote. “And you are celebrating from sunrise to sunset. But what about me? How can I celebrate you?” Noa asked.\n“I hope that you are resting, not worrying, smiling — even if you see me and everyone going crazy with longing and falling apart,” she wrote. “I hope that you hug Eliran tight, and to myself I wish that you will be with me in every step I take, that you will guide me, send me strength to smile and to be happy. Because that’s certainly what you would have wanted.”\nEliran’s sister, Liem, told Ynet that the couple “had an incredible relationship, we always looked at them with admiration. I wished for myself to find a relationship like theirs. Eliran was a person who always spread light and joy around him, entered every room with a big smile. He managed to turn everything sad into something happy. He was my partner, my best friend, my secret keeper, my closest adviser — it’s more than losing a big brother, it’s losing half my heart.”\nThe couple, said Liem, “had a joint funeral — instead of the wedding they had planned.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Shlomo (Dmitry) Reshetnikov, 20, a lone soldier from Russia who served in the Golani Brigade, was killed on October 7 while battling the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nHe was buried on October 13 on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. He is survived by his parents, Natalia and Oleg, and his older brother, Andrey.\nBorn in Volgograd, in southwest Russia, Shlomo moved to Israel in 2017 by himself as a teenager, as part of the Na’aleh program. He completed high school near Haifa and then enlisted in the IDF in 2021.\nYohai Segal, wrote in Israel Hayom that he was Shlomo’s commander in the army when he first enlisted: “Dmitry came to me, two days after he enlisted, and asked that from that day forward I call him Shlomo, because he was a Jewish soldier in Israel… He had a good heart, a very good heart.”\nSarah Yalanzhi, who headed up the dormitory where Shlomo went to high school, said though he arrived late in the school year, he fit right in: “He was a diligent and friendly student, modest and gentle. He was loved in class and by the staff, he was full of joy for life, respected and respectful. He was always ready to help and support, he was a person with a huge heart,” she said, noting that he learned the guitar amid his studies and took part in the school band.\nReporter Lior Ben Ami wrote in Ynet about how he met Shlomo during reporting he did on Golani’s 51st Battalion in Hebron in early 2023. The young soldier told him at the time, “I heard a lot about Israel and I understood that I was Jewish, that this is my country. I moved here not just to learn or to study but also to live here.”\nNoting that his immigrant roots and noticeable accent made him an easy target, Shlomo nevertheless told Ben Ami that he had found a support system in Golani: “We’re like a family. I feel like there are people behind me.”\nShlomo also had a support system in his adoptive family in Israel, Leah and Avidan Sa’ad, with whom he built a connection for close to seven years.\n“It was impossible not to love him,” Leah Sa’ad told Ma’ariv. “He was polite, gentle, our kids connected to him, they were just like siblings.” She said he came to stay with them regularly and spoke often on the phone, “he would share, seek advice.

He was just like one of the family.”\nLeah said, “Shlomo went after his heart and his dream to be in Israel and to serve the homeland. He was so proud to be a combat soldier.”\nWhen Shlomo’s mother, Natalia, came to Israel for his funeral, she united with Leah, and the two mothers identified his body together and grieved for their biological and adoptive son together, they told Ynet.\nNatalia recalled to the news outlet flying to visit Shlomo around a year before he was killed: “When I flew to him, it wasn’t on a plane, it was on wings,” she said. “I was so looking forward to embracing him. The last time he was home he was a child… When we met it was incredible to see a mature boy, serious, and happy.”\nHis mother Natalia said she told him during her visit: “‘Mom, I’m the happiest, I have two mothers in this world — you are far, I can speak to you, and Leah is here, and she is close to me.'”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Maayan Mor, 30, from Holon, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while trying to escape the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nAt 6:30 a.m. on the morning of the massacre, Mor phoned her mother, who told Israeli news outlets, “She screamed hysterically, ‘Mom, there are bullets everywhere,’ and then texted her friend saying, ‘Help me, help me.'”\nShe stayed on the phone for a little while as Mor drove away from Kibbutz Re’im toward Kissufim on Route 232. Eventually, the call disconnected.\nMor was considered missing for one week before her body was found on October 14 and buried the following day in the South Holon Cemetery.\nShe is survived by her parents, Racheli and Yair, as well as her sister Meital.\nMor worked in car appraisal and studied criminology at Beit Berl College. According to a memorial post on Instagram, she dreamed of one day starting a family and having children.\nHer mother, Racheli, wrote on social media: “The connection and love between a mother and daughter cannot be [replaced] and is the most terrible and difficult [to lose]. It is impossible that you are not here; it is impossible that you were murdered like this, my beautiful flower.”\n“You managed to leave a picture of every moment in your life,” her mother added, referring to the myriad selfies Mor took daily and posted to social media.\nHer sister, Meital, wrote on Facebook that Mor was a doting, loving aunt to her nephews Liam and Rom.\n“I can’t describe how much they miss you,” Meital said. “How many questions are left for them—questions even the ‘adults’ don’t have answers to.”\nMor also had a penchant for the dramatic, according to her cousin, Sapir Carmeli.\n“Like your whole life, the ending was over the top. Who are we if not the drama, right Maayan? A simple death of old age was not enough.”\nShe said Mor had a “captivating smile and crazy laughter” and was very perceptive and attuned to others’ emotions.\nFriends remember Mor as a free spirit who knew how to have fun and a good laugh. She was a regular at Kibbutz Rishon, a bar on the beach in Rishon Lezion, and made an overwhelmingly positive impression on the staff.\n“Everyone who saw her coming [would] smile because they know they are about to be happier,” the bar’s Instagram account wrote in a post memorializing Mor.\n“Maayan made sure to enjoy every moment and all the good the world had to offer,” the post added. “She spread smiles and positive energy everywhere she went.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She is survived by her parents, Elad and Yifat, and her younger siblings Aniam, Tahel and Sinai.\nFriends and family said she loved yoga, hula hooping, nature and watching sunsets, and was addicted to drinking coffee. During her mandatory army service, she served as an instructor on the Iron Dome battery, and after she finished she worked as a waitress to save up money for a trip.\nShe had returned to Israel just a few months before she was killed from six months of traveling around the world. Aviya grew up in a religious family, but moved away from that lifestyle as a young adult.\nHer maternal grandmother, Tzipi, told Israel Hayom that the two were notably close, and she even visited Aviya during her trip to South America: “Aviya would go to festivals and come and sleep by me, she would always say to me, ‘Don’t worry about me, when I come home I’ll come to cuddle with you.’ I miss her so much.”\nHer aunt, Yael, was just a few years older than Aviya and the pair would call each other “half,” as shorthand for “my other half.”\n“A ray of sunshine in the body of a person,” she wrote on Instagram. “You would connect to other people within seconds, you drew people together, you were so alive, dancing with happiness, your presence was so felt. It was impossible to miss you when you entered a room… I will always remember your huge smile and your joy. My heart is burning. Now I have been left just a half.”\nHer paternal grandmother, Noga, wrote on Facebook a day before her funeral to “my Aviya, beloved, diligent, with a lust for life… How will we say goodbye to you? How will we not see you anymore? We received a gift for 22.6 years, and tomorrow we will give it back. Tomorrow, God will heal your wounds, and we will cry and cry, and we will die from the sadness and pain.”\nAt her funeral, her mother, Yifat, noted that she was born right before Pesach, and killed on Simhat Torah: “We always said that you had a lofty soul,” she said, pointing out that they learned of her death on Shabbat Bereishit, the Shabbat where they read the first book of the Torah, but “we don’t want to start from the beginning [Bereishit] without you.”\n“For 22.5 years I would admire you, watch you with amazement,” she continued. “This wasn’t all you were blessed with, my love, but with inner beauty and a special goodness, wisdom, knowledge and maturity. This too I would watch with incredulity, how a girl, a young lady, woman who was so young spoke to me with such maturity… I marveled at it in every conversation.”\nYifat thanked Aviya, “that your soul chose us to be your parents. We tried so hard to fulfill that role in a good and correct manner — we didn’t always succeed, sometimes we really failed, you know how it is with a firstborn. I’m sorry my beautiful, sorry for the mistakes, for the times it wasn’t enough and we didn’t know how. The truth is we tried. Thank you my girl, thank you for the time with you, that you raised us, all of us, and taught us how to be better.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Andrey Poshivay, 39, from Beersheba, was killed by Hamas terrorists while guarding the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nArmed solely with a pistol against assailants wielding assault rifles, he managed to take down several terrorists before being mortally wounded.\nHe is survived by his mother, Maria, and his siblings Tatiana and Eugene. He was buried in Beersheba on October 11.\nThose close to him attest that his accurate shooting stemmed from a lifetime of honing his skills as a hunter and marksman, cultivated since his formative years in the small Crimean village of Vishnevka, where he was born.\nTall, fit, with piercing blue eyes, Andrey’s calm and confident demeanor made him the face of the Israeli police to Russian-speaking journalists. A quintessential self-made man, he diligently learned Hebrew and then English, relentlessly pursuing his goal to excel as an officer and policeman.\nRaised as a typical Ukrainian country boy who enjoyed fishing and playing video games, Andrey was unaware of his Jewish roots until later in life.\n“During the German occupation in World War II, his family destroyed all evidence of their heritage,” recalls his friend, Vishnevka-resident Ilona Lysakova. “He was thrilled about his connection to Israel. During visits [to Ukraine] after his emigration, we would spend entire nights by the campfire, enthralled by his stories of life in Israel, while he was quite the heartthrob among the local girls.”\nAfter serving in the Ukrainian armed forces, Andrey moved to Israel in 2004 and enlisted in the Israeli military, driven by his dream. His initial application for officer training was rejected due to his limited Hebrew. However, a chance encounter with a senior officer who recognized his potential changed his trajectory. This officer secured Andrey a spot in the program with a stern warning: “Don’t let me down.” Embracing the challenge, Andrey not only met but exceeded expectations, rising to the rank of major by the end of his service in 2019.\nHe then joined the police force, starting anew. His journey to becoming an inspector in the Beersheba patrol police was arduous but fulfilling.\n“Mastering new languages was tough for him, but necessary for police work. So, he dedicated himself to learning and still managed to squeeze in time for jogging at 2 a.m.,” shares his Ukrainian friend Victor Zelinsky.\nAndrey’s role required tact as much as it did enforcement, especially while stationed in small Bedouin villages where diplomacy was as crucial as policing.\nHis last assignment — to provide security at a rave — seemed straightforward but turned tragic when the event escalated into a massacre. Andrey responded as only he knew how, with the bravery and decisiveness that had defined his entire career.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Lior Ben Yaakov, 44, from Yesha, was killed on October 7 while battling against the Hamas invasion of southern Israel.\nThe deputy chief of his community’s local security team, he was posthumously recognized as a fallen soldier with the rank of sergeant major in the reserves.\nHe is survived by his wife, Revital, their three children, Ella, Ziv and Itamar, his parents, Tzipora and Moshe and his two sisters, Revital and Ilanit. His funeral was held on October 12 in Rehovot, and he was buried in Tzohar.\nHe was called up to the neighboring Moshav Mivtahim at 6:30 that morning when news broke of a terrorist invasion of the area. There, the small security team encountered dozens of terrorists trying to invade the seven small communities clustered together. Lior was slain there alongside his wife’s cousin-in-law and his close friend, Tal Maman, and the pair were buried side by side. Ultimately, the terrorists abandoned their plans to attack those communities and turned around, though five members were killed in the battles.\nLior owned a company that worked on developing products used in emergency medicine.\nHis sister-in-law, Aya, wrote on Facebook, “Liori, the man who marveled at combining unfathomable seriousness with a spirit of silliness, the man who was like a son to my parents, the man who I resembled more than I did my own sister, the father of Ella and Ziv and Itamar, the man who my sister loved so much. We are left broken.”\nLior’s brother-in-law, Maoz Degani, wrote on Facebook that the pair hadn’t been best friends from the start, “but with time I discovered a funny man, loving, a wonderful father, protective, who loved rock, kind-hearted, knew everything, a fighter, strong inside and out — did I already say funny?”\nIn time, he said, they became friends, and “I would call to ask for financial advice and Lior would call to ask for marketing advice. Between couscous and coffee at Tzippy and Moshe’s we would talk about the kids, fight about politics, show each other YouTube videos of [Pink Floyd guitarist] David Gilmour.”\nSpeaking to Yediot Aharonot, Lior’s sister Ilanit said, “I think the best thing I can say about him is that he was the best brother I could have asked for.”\n“He was a good friend, a dedicated family man, a man with values and my partner for doing nonsense,” she added. In a Facebook post announcing his death, Ilanit wrote that “my dear brother — the funny, smart, protective, beloved by me and his big sister — has left us. He leaves behind tons of personal charm, laughter, a spirit of silliness, caring, bravery, a loving wife, three sweet and brave children, a pained mother and father, two sisters with a hole in their hearts and many broken hearts.”\nHis wife, Revital, told the Kan public broadcaster that Lior was a deeply devoted and involved father.\n“He’s incredibly smart, he was the main parent, he changed the diapers and combed the hair and made the ponytails and packed the bag for kindergarten, made the sandwiches for school — everything, all of it was him,” she said.\n“He was present, in so many things, for that reason his loss is felt so much,” she said.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

There he and many others were killed when Hamas terrorists threw grenades inside and opened fire on those seeking shelter, ultimately kidnapping five of those inside, including Hersh Goldberg-Polin.\nSegev’s friend Itamar Shapira, who attended the rave and survived, told Channel 12 news that he recalls Segev standing next to him inside the shelter “and I remember he said to me, ‘No, no, this can’t be real, this can’t be happening.'”\nItamar, who was seriously wounded but survived after a long recovery, said he was right next to Segev, “and he was hit by three bullets, which killed him on the spot — and those bullets are basically what saved me. They would have hit me if not him.”\nAnother of their friends, Alon Ohel, was taken hostage from the shelter, and remains captive in Gaza, while their friend Ayelet Arnin was also killed inside the structure.\nSegev’s body was identified only several days later, and he was buried on October 12 in Misgav. He is survived by his parents, Tali and Yevgeny, and his two younger siblings.\nHe had only recently completed his mandatory military service, during which he served in the Israel Navy as a radio operator on missile boats. His family and friends said he had a great sense of humor, was devoted to his dog, Leslie, and was a dedicated fan of the Barcelona soccer team.\nA week after his funeral, his aunt Caroline Vizental wrote on Facebook, “It’s been a week since we parted from you but we didn’t really part. How can we say goodbye to you, from your smile and from your saying, ‘Carolina, enough!'”\n“I can’t believe that around the holiday table, birthdays and just any family gatherings we will be fewer, I can’t believe that they took you from us in a second,” she wrote. “We received you as a gift, but we didn’t get to enjoy you. It was too short! I promise you to look after everyone, and ourselves, together, and to be strong and keep laughing, including at your nonsense.”\nSeveral months later, she shared a painting of Segev, writing: “This is how we will always remember you our beautiful child, our Segev, with a crazy smile and the deepest gaze that was only yours.”\nHis friend Oz David wrote on Instagram that Segev was a devoted fan of the Barcelona soccer team, and when they served together in the Navy, “even when we would go out to sea he would find a way to get the results of the games from the shore. He wanted to get a tattoo of Barca but sadly he never got to.” Oz wrote that Segev “was a really wonderful kid who never did anything bad to anyone, and just wanted to go out to party — trance music festivals and Barca were his two great loves in life.”\nHis mother, Tali, told The Australian that one of his friends who survived the attack took the Star of David pendant that he always wore from his body and gave it to his family.\n“He got [the pendant] for his bar mitzvah and he never took it off, but his friends brought it back to us with his own blood still on it,” she said. “He was not armed, they just slaughtered him.”\nTali later told a memorial Instagram page that Segev knew how to “set a goal and achieve it. I was very proud to see him take control as a big brother.” She added that “everything with Segev turned into magic. His charisma and his wit, his deep humor, turned every family gathering, every car drive, every trip abroad into an experience.

The pair sought safety in a roadside bomb shelter near Kibbutz Be’eri, and were slain there along with at least seven others — including Raz Mizrahi and Kim Dukarker — when Hamas threw grenades inside the structure and opened fire.\nHer mother, Anna, told Maariv that around 8 a.m. Sofia sent her a message “saying that she loved us and that she was blessed with us as parents.” That was the last they heard from her.\nSofia’s body was identified several days later. She was buried on October 10 in Carmiel.\nShe is survived by her parents, Anna and Vladislav, and her sister Evelina.\nAccording to her friend, Alina Yankovich, Sofia was a “girl who loved life, and her smile never left her face.” Because of her “love for Judaism and for Israel, Sofia chose to convert and to become Jewish,” she wrote, noting that she pursued the goal for several years and was officially recognized as Jewish just two weeks before she was killed, “and never got to pick up the certification.”\nOn a memorial Instagram page set up for Sofia, her younger sister, Evelina, wrote to “my beautiful sister — what will I do without you, what am I supposed to do now?!?!”\nEvelina said that she had dreams for the future of Sofia getting married and having kids, and Evelina “getting a boyfriend, and you would do my makeup and help me get ready and we would stay sisters like that forever, like best friends.”\n“We wanted to open a TikTok together and do so many other cool things like that,” she added. “I always thought about how you would look as a grandma, that you’d be one of those cool grandmas but now I don’t know. I wanted to get a sister tattoo with you… You don’t know what I would give just to hug you one more time, to talk to you one more time.”\nHer mother, Anna, wrote in December, “My beloved girl, it’s a shame that God took you so soon.

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Gali Roy Shakotai, 21, a Nahal soldier from Tzofar in the south, was killed on October 7 while battling Hamas at the Sufa IDF outpost near Gaza.\nHis uncle, Moti Shakotai, told Army Radio that Gali had completed a shift on guard duty at 4 a.m. and had just fallen asleep when the attack began: “He barely had time to put on his uniform, but he put on his helmet and vest and shoes and went out to battle.” Moti said Gali helped to rescue some of his comrades who had been wounded and brought them to a hidden storage area before returning to the front lines, where he was killed.\nHe was buried on October 12 in the cemetery in Tzofar, a small town in the south along the border with Jordan. He is survived by his parents, Osher and Reuven (Rubi), and his younger siblings, Noam, Shiraz and Talia.\nBefore enlisting in the army, Gali spent a year doing national service, working with troubled youth who had difficulty in traditional frameworks. His family said he loved growing up in the desert, exploring the area via ATV and familiarizing himself with the land, and when he joined the army he fought to be placed in a combat unit.\nHis close childhood friend, Staff Sgt. Roy Elias, was killed fighting in south Gaza on December 23, and buried next to Gali.\nElias’s sister, Hadar, told Ynet that when her brother heard about Gali’s death on October 7, “The first thing Roy said to me was, ‘What will I do without Gali?’ He wrote me on Whatsapp: ‘I can’t do it anymore, I see him everywhere I go.’ He was really shattered by it, he didn’t stop visiting his grave.”\nGali’s aunt, Isabel Shakotai, wrote on Facebook a tribute to “our Gali, with your big, kind smiling eyes, which were like a window into your huge heart, which was full of good, only good. You left us a hole in our hearts, our hero, beloved boy. But don’t worry, we will fill that hole, with all the beautiful memories you left us, which nobody can take from us.”\nA eulogy read at his funeral on behalf of the community of Tzofar described him as “a young man of love. A boy and a teen with bright eyes who managed to instill confidence and pure joy of life in every child and adult he encountered. Until his last day, Gali chose to do and to act on behalf of others. He had the ability to make people happy, to make them laugh, and to extend a sensitive and warm hand to every friend who needed him.”\nGali, the eulogy read, was “a child of the desert who loved the desert that his yard overlooked. At every opportunity and at every gathering with friends he would choose to go outside, sometimes on his ATV which would make noise in the desert and sometimes with friends, and they would load up with wine and their coffee maker and sit and love — they loved this life with the endless spaces where they grew up.”\nGali’s cousin, Aviv, wrote on Facebook about “Gali of the Arava and of nature, who loved animals and had encyclopedic knowledge, Gali who loved to fool around, who tested every boundary, who created from nothing — no matter where I look in Rubi and Osher’s yard I see something that Gali made or found and fixed up.”\nAviv wrote, “I would ask all the time for him to take me around on the ATV and introduce me to cool and secret places in the Arava, and Gali, who was dead tired, who had just come back from the army or from national service — and who has the strength to entertain a cousin asking for a favor? But you would say yes, because that was the size of your heart. You made everyone feel special and important to you.”\nAs the memorials and tributes poured in, Aviv wrote, “I thought to myself how very alive you were, how can it be that a person like this died just like that? You empowered this world with your emotion and your energy, your endless curiosity which gave you a sum of experiences that would normally take a lifetime — at least that’s what I want to tell myself.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

When the rocket fire started, the troops returned to the bomb shelter at the small Paga IDF outpost right next to the border, before they realized that Hamas terrorists had invaded the base.\nHabib was wounded in the fighting against Hamas, and his comrade Sgt. Ido Binenstock, a paramedic, was trying to treat him when he was also shot and killed.\nThey and 11 others from the 13th battalion — including the outpost commander, Cpt.

The couple were slated to travel to Rome together to celebrate his 80th birthday and had already bought tickets for their trip.\n“We had plans — we didn’t make it to 50 years [of marriage], I thought we would,” she said.\nGideon is survived by his wife, Orna, his children Eran, Raz, Irit and Tal, and a number of grandchildren, as well as his brother Ran. He was buried on October 23 in Kibbutz Hatzerim.\nGideon and his brother Ran came to the kibbutz in the 1960s as a part of a group of pioneers to settle and cultivate the land. According to the kibbutz, he worked in several jobs there over the years, including coordinating the farm, managing the Negev “cooperative” which organized the distribution of agricultural products, working in the field of gardening and decoration as well as serving as the kibbutz secretary.\nIn later years he realized his dream by planting a small vineyard in the kibbutz and beginning to make his own wine, alongside a group of friends including hostage Chaim Peri, producing about 1,000 bottles a year for family and friends.\n“Gideon’s years were full of love for life, good food and good wine,” the kibbutz wrote in a post online. “In Nir Oz he established along with friends a small vineyard, in which he invested his energy and his time. The connection to nature ran through the Pauker family — Gideon loved the field of gardening and also worked in it — his figure on a little tractor is recalled by every one of us.”\nSpeaking to Channel 12 news in November, his daughter, Irit Pauker, said, “Emotion is a resource you don’t know how to divide. This isn’t reality, so I don’t feel anything because I don’t yet miss my father, he hasn’t disappeared for me yet. This isn’t reality yet.”\nHis grandson, Gal Pauker, penned a tribute on Facebook to “my beloved grandfather.”\n“I hope that you didn’t suffer and that you are in a better place,” he wrote. “Next week we were supposed to celebrate your 80th birthday and instead we need to plan for a funeral… You were an incredible grandfather, a positive person, smiling, smart and optimistic. You had so much ahead of you and now you’re not here. I will love you forever, and I can’t come to terms with the fact that we won’t meet again for a glass of wine, that we won’t laugh together and talk about everything.

After he jumps off, Raz is seen being shot dead by the terrorists as the other hostages, including Hersh Goldberg-Polin, watched from the truck.\nHis family said that Raz was already wounded by gunshots when he attempted to escape.\n“He was brave and jumped from the truck, tried to flee and if he wasn’t wounded he would have fought back!” his brother, Ofek, wrote online. “We are proud of his choice and the courage and daring he had, which God gave him in those moments… He did what we knew he would do, try to save himself against all the odds.”\nHis body was found and identified a week later, and he was buried on October 15 in Beit Nehemia. He is survived by his parents, Riki and Amos, his brothers Ofek and Noam and his grandmother Perla.\nHe attended the rave with his friends Shaked Habani and Roni Polbanov who were both also slain that day.\nHis close friend, Master Sgt. (res.) Ilay Cohen was called up to the reserves during the war, serving in Gaza, where he memorialized Raz by scrawling his name on buildings in the Strip until Cohen was killed fighting on December 5.\nRaz worked as a cook at the M25 restaurant in Tel Aviv and had only just returned from a six-month trip overseas a few weeks before the rave. His friends said he loved horseback riding and surfing, and had completed his army service just over a year before he was killed. He had started out as a combat soldier but moved to be a cook due to health issues, which is where his love for the kitchen began.\nThe chef at M25, Jonathan Borowitz, wrote that “Raz was a cook and part of the kitchen team at the restaurant for several months, until he traveled for a trip in South America,” and that Friday, the day before he was killed, was his first shift back in the restaurant following his return to Israel.\nBefore he left, wrote Borowitz, “I wished him the trip of his life, and I asked him not to miss out on anything — he traveled, enjoy and returned.” On Friday, he said, the restaurant was so busy that even though “we worked together for many hours that day, we didn’t get a chance to talk. I wanted to hear about his plans for the future, where he saw himself in this industry and I wanted to talk about the world.\n“I told myself that I wouldn’t bother him now with this, I would let him party, this is his time, and next week we would sit, talk and make plans. But next week didn’t come, and Raz was murdered a few hours after his shift at the festival near Kibbutz Re’im. Our Raz, beautiful, wonderful, noble heroic and fearless. The Meatmarket family will remember you forever.”\nHis mother, Riki, wrote online that “Raz’s passion was to cook and excel in that field.” She said that the family was both pained and proud to see his final moments that day: “Even in the enormous nightmare of October 7 he decided what would be… They killed him but he decided that they wouldn’t take him.”\nOfek told the Kan public broadcaster in December that Raz “had an incredible smile, he had faith in God, he had bravery like you see in that footage… In the kitchen he could make a meal out of any crumb,” he added. “He loved to see people eating his food and enjoying.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

(Marco Longari/AFP)\nSpeaking at the funeral, Garin’s 11th-grade teacher, Omri Gur, addressed the fact that the media was portraying his former student as a reformed criminal, asking people to change their perception of him.\n“In 12th grade, you lost your way,” Gur said. But, he noted, Garin was determined to use his military service as a lifeline: “Your story is not one of a young criminal who changed for the better,” his teacher said. “It is a story of an outstanding young man, a wonderful young man, who made a mistake and fought to return to himself again… and I will not let anyone tell this story differently.”\nHis close friend Armias Geneo said that when they met in basic training, “Cedrick told me that they tried to put him in the military police. But it wasn’t enough for him — he wanted a more meaningful military service. He wanted to be a combat soldier! He stayed put and drove them crazy… and in the end, he got on the Givati bus.”\n“He was a perfect fighter,” Geneo added. During their service, Garin stopped a terror attack in Hebron during a military operation there, shooting the would-be terrorist in the leg.\nDaniela Garin speaks to visitors as she mourns her husband Cedrick in Tel Aviv on January 29, 2024. (Maya Zanger-Nadis/Times of Israel)\n“The reason he didn’t shoot the terrorist in the head,” said his friend, “is because there were civilians and children behind him.”\nGarin’s ultimate goal was to provide financially for his mother Imelda so that she could stop working. He was happily married and looked forward to one day becoming a father. He wanted “a messy house full of children and noise,” wife Daniela recalled during the funeral.\nGarin hoped to pursue a career in security, he told the IDF website in 2021 after he received a certificate of distinction: “I discovered [during my IDF service] that I love it… Every time I am guarding… I feel like, ‘Wow, people can sleep in peace because of us. Because I am here.’ That’s what I want to do my whole life.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Bnayahu Bitton, 22, from Jerusalem, was murdered by Hamas terrorists next to Kibbutz Be’eri after fleeing the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nSurveillance footage from that morning shows Bitton and two friends, Yonatan Samerano and Maor Gratzyani, fleeing the rave and arriving at the gate to Be’eri, seeking safety. There they were ambushed and all shot dead by a group of Hamas terrorists. Later, terrorists stole Bitton’s car and Samerano’s body was taken by two men, including a UNRWA worker, and loaded into a white jeep and taken to Gaza, where his body remains.\nBitton is survived by his parents, Ital and Eli, his two younger sisters Yael and Avigail, and several siblings from his parents’ first marriages, including sisters Nofar and Noa and brother Assaf. He was buried on October 14 in Jerusalem. On the day of his funeral, a new niece was born to his brother Assaf.\nHis family owns a flower shop in Bayit Vegan, where Bnayahu would help out from time to time. While he grew up observant, attending Haredi schools, in later years he moved away from the ultra-Orthodox lifestyle, as did several of his siblings.\nHe had completed his army service — in the elite Egoz command unit — just a month before he attended the rave, and was looking to continue his path with music, including exploring enrolling in music studies, his family said.\nJust a few weeks before he was killed, Bitton, a budding musician, auditioned for Hakochav Haba, the singing contest which selects Israel’s Eurovision contestant. While playing the guitar, he sang “Ruach Hayam” by Ofer Levi in an early round of the auditions.\n“When he was born, light entered into the house,” his sister, Noa, told a Kan radio program.\n“Since he was little, around 6, he was involved in music, my mother sent him to learn how to play the darbuka,” she said, noting that music helped him with his ADHD struggles. “He would play and drum and he had a wonderful sense of rhythm.”\nIn later years, she said, he picked up the guitar, like all of his siblings, “and he would play all sorts of different strange instruments… He played a lot and he left so many videos of him singing, things he wrote and composed,” she said.\n“He was always playing — you couldn’t find Bnayahu without a guitar in one hand and a cigarette in his mouth, and usually beer in his other hand. He was always singing, we would jam together, the sisters with our quieter voices and he with his deep and strong throaty voice, and the neighbors always would say that they could only hear his voice.”\nThe last video he posted on Instagram, on October 5, was a cover of him singing and playing “Tir’i Ahuvati” (Look, My Love) by Osher Cohen.\nHis four sisters sat down with the Kan public broadcaster in December to discuss their grief and the loss of their brother.\n“He was my best friend and my big brother,” said Yael. “He was meant to be my support system in life, and I his. We had plans, and now we don’t.”\nHis sister Nofar posted a drawing of him on Facebook on her birthday, writing: “My beloved Bnayahu, today I am celebrating my birthday without you. All I wanted to do today was to draw you, to go over the features of your face and to describe your spirit. I am imagining how you would sing to me, how I would hug you hard, how we would drink a shot together and raise a glass to life. I love you and I miss you so much I can’t breathe.”\nSpeaking to the Makor Rishon newspaper, his mother, Ital, said that “Bnayahu looked for the path to true and simplicity. In the Haredi world he didn’t find the truth. He looked in other places, and found authentic people at music festivals — people full of love and joy. The simplicity united them. This was their Simhat Torah.”\nItal said that her son “knew how to pay attention to people who were overlooked. He had an outlook on the world as if he had come to fulfill a specific purpose. Bnayahu was the glue of the family.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She is survived by her parents, Rivka and Meir, and her siblings Yossi, Mazi, Liz, Or and Tamir.\nLiz, an accountant, worked for the Neto financial planning company and also served as a board member at the Tamar water company, which serves the cities of Ramle, Gedera and Kiryat Malachi. At a memorial unveiling a plaque at the water company, the director, Yossi Ben Hemo, said that “Liraz operated with wisdom, care and great loyalty to the Tamar water company.

She deserves that everyone should know how good and special she was.”\n“She had so many aspirations, motivation to succeed, to develop her career,” her siblings told the news site. “This year everything was supposed to open up for her, and it was all cut short… she loved her nieces and nephews and spent time with them, was their math teacher. She was all heart, everyone who knew her could say where she sat in their heart. People felt that part of their hearts left with her.”\nHer brother, Yossi, told Ynet that “if I keep talking about her, it will always sound like a cliche.

Finding the first two entirely full, they huddled in the third shelter they could find. Eventually, Hamas terrorists approached the shelter, and Shemer waited at the entrance to try and fight them. Unfortunately, they stopped some distance away and threw grenades. Dan and Omer were severely injured, and Dan later died from his wounds. Shemer was the least hurt.\nOmer reported hearing Shemer fighting with the terrorists outside the shelter, and eventually, he was able to escape.

    "story": "Cpl. Naama Bony, 19, a soldier in the 7th Armored Brigade, from Afula, was killed on October 7 when Hamas terrorists attacked the Yiftah IDF base next to Zikim.\nNaama, who served in human resources for the IDF, had begun her mandatory service seven months earlier, and had celebrated her 19th birthday just a week before she was killed.\nThe morning of the attack, she was on guard duty when the Hamas invasion began. She texted her friends and family that there were terrorists in the base, and she was surrounded by some soldiers who had already been killed or wounded.\nNaama was slain alongside a number of soldiers protecting the base, including Staff Sgt. Ido Harush, seen with her in final videos and photos from that morning. Her mother said that while she was stationed at the base’s fence during the invasion, she managed to call many others inside the base and tell them to seek safety.\nShe is survived by her parents, Yael and Yoav, her older brother Yuval, 21, and younger brother Yair, 16. She was buried on October 9 in Afula.\n“I think she’s the salt of the earth, not because she’s my daughter, but because she was very moral, all of her life, and very dedicated to her goals and to her path, and it didn’t surprise me that she didn’t leave [her posting],” her mother, Yael, said during a musical memorial gathering hosted by Ynet.\n“She was a wonderful girl, as parents she gave us the feeling that she understood the tricks of the trade, things fell into place as a teen, and she knew how to have a rich social life based on her deep friend connections. She made people feel special, she listened to them, she accepted them,” her mother added.\n“She was a very curious child, she very much loved the field of music,” said Yael. “She would put together very interesting playlists with a lot of variety,” noting that Naama was shocked to discover that none of the soldiers in her basic training course were familiar with classic Israeli singer Yehudit Ravitz.\nTwo weeks after she was killed, her younger brother, Yair, wrote on Instagram to “my Naamuna, my sister, my second mother, my role model, my guardian angel.”\n“We’re starting now a new chapter, a chapter without you, and I’m scared to get lost because usually you were the one who balanced me and directed me on the right path,” he wrote. “We planned to live together after the army, to get matching tattoos, to travel abroad — you were the most important person to me in the world.”\nHer older brother, Yuval, spoke to the Kan public broadcaster about their time growing up together.\n“Naamuna would come during breaks [in school] and ask if anyone had bothered me in class, even though she was a year and a half younger than me,” he said. “She sang wonderfully, all types of music, as if it was important to her to check them all off. Naama knew old Israeli songs that most kids her age didn’t recognize. She would come into my room and do an annoying imitation of my deep voice, and how I act like a responsible older brother, and I would crack up laughing.”\n“When you enlisted, we suddenly stopped fighting, mostly the dumb fight over who got the car,” he continued. “We started to support each other. I guess enlisting made us miss each other, and created an understanding between us that life is short, and that every moment between us is important.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

I was always convinced that he was OK, because it was Guy. Nothing could happen to him, he was the strongest.”\nLater that night, his family received the news that he had been killed in the battle.\nHe is survived by his parents, Carmit and Yuval, and his sisters Tamar and Adi. He was buried in Kochav Yair on October 11.\nGrowing up, he was an active member of his local scouts troop. He dreamed of following in his father’s footsteps and serving in Golani’s Battalion 51, which his father, Brig. Gen. (res.) Yuval Bazak, had commanded before he was born.\n“His commanders told us how much they loved and appreciated Guy, what a leader he was in the platoon and in the company,” said Tamar. “Guy always wanted to take part in every activity, he always sought out actions with meaning.” On that fateful Saturday, she said, “I knew he was waiting for the moment they would let his force take action.”\nAfter he was killed, his family was handed a list he had written a year before he was killed, titled “20 things I want to do before I turn 20.” The list included “leave a lasting mark on the scout troop”; “make someone feel good”; “pick exotic countries to visit in the world”; as well as to find the best version of his favorite dish to cook and eat — pasta carbonara, a search his family has taken up in the wake of his death.\nGuy’s father, Yuval told 103FM radio that his son was a “wonderful, wonderful kid.”\n“A charismatic guy, a leader from birth, with a incredibly creative mind,” he said. Yuval said “it was totally clear to me that Guy would be a combat soldier. We were raised that way and we raised [him] that way… Guy was destined for greatness, he was a born leader.”\nDuring battle that day, “they were so heroic and professional, but in the end they didn’t have a chance.”\nA week before he was killed, Guy and his friends recorded themselves singing the Backstreet Boys’ hit “I Want it That Way” in the car — and the song turned into a form of comfort for his family and friends, who sang it throughout the shiva mourning period, choosing to remember Guy in his happier moments.\nTamar told Ynet that “Guy had a very dominant presence — in the family, his little cousins really admired him; in the scouts, all the grade levels below him knew and loved him; in his friend group he was the glue who kept everyone together.”\n“He was talented, funny and creative. He learned to play the guitar and taught himself to play the piano, he loved to climb and to draw,” she said, noting that Guy was the middle child in the family, between his older and younger sisters, and “he had a rare sensitivity, which only those close to him got to see.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Noam Shallom, 25, from Pardes Hanna, was murdered by Hamas at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nShe attended the rave with her friend Bar Tomer who was also slain that day. Loved ones said she was last heard from shortly after 9 a.m., when she said she and others were hiding from terrorists amid heavy gunfire.\nNoam was missing for more than a week before her body was identified and her family was informed of her death. She was buried on October 15 in Ein Iron.\nShe is survived by her parents, Tomer and Hadas, and her three younger siblings, Gal, Libi and Koren.\nNoam grew up in Pardes Hanna and was living in Tel Aviv, working as a social media manager for two online fashion brands.\nRonit Yam, the jewelry designer whose social media she ran, wrote on their Instagram that Noam “was good. You were too good.”\nNoam became part of the family, they wrote. “You took Ronit Yam and Sensea and launched them so far and so strong — we were exhausted and we couldn’t keep up. You sent us all into a crazy turbo work mode, every project was another stage and another step,” the company recounted.\n“You brought us pride in who you are, a whirlwind, perfectionist, a true girl of nature, and you are ours and you will always be ours and a part of us forever.”\nIn her memory, her loved ones launched an Instagram page titled “Self love club,” continuing her own initiative to urge her followers to find inner peace, and in her own words “Make sure you are happy in real life, not just in social media.”\nHer cousin, Aya Shallom, wrote on social media a week after her funeral that the pair were more like sisters than cousins.\n“You’re not like my sister, you’re my sister, in my heart. They took a piece of my heart,” she wrote. “Amid all this pain, I promise you that I will walk in your path, I will listen to beautiful and happy music and dance exactly how you danced, exactly how we danced. I will love and I will be loved, just like you, like us.”\nWhen they were younger, Aya wrote, “We planned to find two hot brothers, one for me and one for you, and marry them, and have kids together and help each other with everything. In time we realized that our plans were different and reality was different — but I didn’t think it would be this much. I will miss you every day in every moment. You will always be in my heart.”\nHer brother, Gal, wrote on Instagram to “Noam, Noami, my big sister, ray of sunshine.”\n“The most beautiful girl I know, the strongest woman I ever met,” he wrote. “You were taken from us too soon, you slipped from between our fingers before we could notice and you left a huge hole in our hearts, a hole that will never be filled.”\n“You walked among us for 25 years, like a beautiful angel, full of light, joy and endless love. A guardian angel who knows how to hug when sad and lift up when we fall, an angel who knows how to celebrate life… You taught me to be strong, you taught me not to give up on what I love and who I love, you taught me what true friendship is, you were my role model… Thank you for leaving me in the dust in every area of life and pushing me to improve.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Cpt. (res.) Elhanan Meir Kalmanson, 41, an officer in the Judea and Samaria Division from the West Bank settlement of Otniel, was killed on October 8 battling Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Be’eri.\nElhanan and his brother, Menahem, heard on October 7 about the Hamas invasion of southern Israel and set out for the front lines, before they had even been called up to reserve duty. They fought against Hamas terrorists in Be’eri for hours that day, helping to evacuate dozens of survivors, and were later joined by their nephew Itiel.\nThe next day, while working to clear out any remaining terrorists in Be’eri, they entered one final home and were ambushed by a group of terrorists who shot Elhanan dead.\nHe was buried on October 12 in Otniel. His wife, Shlomit, survives him, their five children Shai, Tal, Mevaser, Keren and Hod, as well as his parents Benny and Yochi and his siblings.\nThe group which he led that day in battle, nicknamed “Elhanan’s team,” is being honored with an Israel Prize for “civilian heroism.”\nItiel, who joined his uncles in Be’eri that day, told Globes that the fighting “was insane — volleys of shells from our tanks, their anti-tank missiles, rockets falling, attack helicopters firing, grenades. Usually, you first take out the threat and then evacuate people, but Elhanan was a security guy, he has a lot of experience and he has written combat training guides for local security teams. He understood immediately that the situation was different and we couldn’t wait until the fighting was over.”\nIn February, Itiel’s firstborn son was born, named for his fallen great-uncle. His uncle had an “entire life of activity, of dedication, of a sense of mission, of building, of unflinching concern for the safety and the life of the people of Israel in its land. I was privileged to learn so much from him, in the 23 years that I was his nephew, and in the final hours I was by his side,” said Itiel at the circumcision. “He is first and foremost a beloved uncle, but also an incredible national and historical figure.”\nSeveral weeks after he was killed, his cousin, Lt. Pedayah Mark, fell while fighting in the Gaza Strip. Pedayah’s father, Elhanan’s uncle, was killed in a terror attack in 2016.\nElhanan, who worked for the Mossad intelligence agency, was also the security chief for Otniel.\n“Anyone who knew Elhanan even a little knew that this was the most natural thing in the world, that wherever help was needed, devotion, wherever leadership, thoughtfulness, bravery, wherever there aren’t enough people — Elhanan was there,” his father, Benny, said at his funeral, according to Makor Rishon.\n“In our family,” he added, “we laugh about everything — this is well known. I apologize that after seeing the dedication of all those who organized the funeral, I want to say that Elhanan would have done it much better.”\nAt his funeral, his wife Shlomit recounted “20 years of many shared experiences, challenges, celebrations, conversations, tears.” Only two weeks earlier, she said, they celebrated two decades of being together: “Two weeks ago, 20 years seemed like a lot. Now it seems like so little.”\n“I wanted forever with you,” she added. “We dreamed how we would grow old together, and what we would do over the years. We had so many plans for our long lives… You were my rock. You always knew, immediately, what I needed in any situation. You loved the children so much, you were so proud of them… For you, family was the highest value.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He is survived by his parents, Shay and Keren, and his sisters, Noam and Lior.\nGrowing up, Leibovitz was a star student and continued his intellectual pursuits in the army, according to his father, Shay, who told Channel 13 in February that Leibovitz read books at a “dizzying pace.”\nAn avid sports fan from a young age, Leibovitz was always up-to-date on the statistics for his favorite teams at home and abroad. He was also a skilled athlete and became a standout volleyball player at the KKTA Tel Aviv-based club. After his death, the club’s youth team was named “Tomer” after him, and the men’s team was called “Tomer’s Friends.”\n“Tomer was full of light, goodness, determination, and initiative,” his father said. “He loved people and animals.”\nOne week before his death, Leibovitz rescued two puppies from the Nahal Oz base and convinced his family to adopt them. He named them Tank and Ace.\nAccording to his father, Leibovitz was meant to join the IDF as an “exceptional athlete” to focus on volleyball but decided just before enlisting that he wanted to be a combat soldier in the armored corps.\nKoby Levy, who served with Leibovitz, said he was “a man who proves that compassion… goes hand in hand with steadfast, deadly militancy.”\n“So many people love you, Tomer,” his close friend and fellow volleyball player, Ron Tidhar, wrote in an Instagram post. “Always open, supportive, and listening.”\n“My Tomer, wonderful child, you were the glory of humankind — a unique creation that cannot be replicated. You were always learning new things, advancing, and developing,” Leibovitz’s father said.\n“I am sure that if you had lived, you would have changed the world… I love you, my child, and I miss you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

When the rocket fire began, Ziv texted her father about what was happening, but said she was fine and, “Don’t tell Mom anything.” Several hours later, Ziv texted her mom from Lin’s phone, saying: “Mom, we’re in a terror attack; I love you.”\nThat was the last anyone heard from either Frenkel or Dafni, who were considered missing for close to a week. The inseparable best friends were buried side by side in Kibbutz Ein Hamifratz in back-to-back funerals on October 15.\nDafni is survived by her parents, Ilil and Yogev, and her two younger brothers, Yahli and Eden.\nDafni was an avid traveler and spent four months in South America with Frenkel at the beginning of 2023 after their army service.

According to a memorial post online, Dafni had a knack for creating great travel itineraries that made for fun and exciting trips, always making sure her companions were enjoying themselves just as much as she was.\nShe also had an eye for aesthetics and loved baking and preparing food. According to friends and family, Dafni would make beautiful cakes and fruit platters for her loved ones’ birthdays. In high school, she studied photography and particularly enjoyed photographing sunsets and uniquely plated food at restaurants.\nDafni loved the beach, which is where she often took her sunset photos. Friends recalled that she had an impressive bathing suit collection and would go to the beach every day after school when the weather was warm enough. Even without the beach, she loved being outside and exercising year-round. During her army service, she would gather her friends for spontaneous workout sessions using cleaning supplies and whatever weights they could find on hand, according to her memorial website.\nAt nearly 23 years old, Dafni had only just begun planning her future. She was interested in graphic and interior design and was also considering becoming a certified pilates instructor. According to her mother, Ilil, she was a free spirit, “like a magnificent butterfly.”\n“Our beloved, sweet, pure Linush, who only wanted to live life to the fullest,” her father Yogev wrote on Facebook shortly after her death. “Your light, my beloved girl, will stay with us forever.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Ch. Insp. Kim Dukarker, a 22-year-old off-duty Border Police officer, was killed by Hamas on October 7 while trying to flee the Supernova music festival.\nKim, a resident of Yavne, is survived by her parents and two younger brothers. Her funeral was held on October 12.\nAn Instagram page set up in Kim’s memory shows snapshots of her life: dressed in her army uniform, her straight black hair tied tightly in a ponytail; training in the field; singing and partying with friends; wearing a pink flower in her hair, her large green eyes looking into ahead pensively; wearing a sleeveless turquoise evening gown with her hair tied up in a bun; dressed as a butterfly surrounded by butterflies at a party.\nKim “excelled at whatever she did,” and was a “role model” to many who knew her, her father Israel said in an interview. She was determined to become an officer, advance in her role, and significantly contribute to her country.\nOn leave from her policing duties that weekend, Kim attended the dance party with her two close friends Neta David and Raz Mizrahi. When the rocket alarms sounded, they fled from the festival grounds toward Kibbutz Be’eri, where they entered a bomb shelter, unaware that the kibbutz and the whole area were also awash with infiltrated terrorists.\nKim and Raz were both killed when terrorists threw six grenades into the bomb shelter where they and other festival goers had sought refuge.\nHer friend Raz, who had survived a car ramming attack in East Jerusalem in 2021, was post-traumatic and terrorized. She refused to leave the shelter, even as they heard shots outside and the realization sank in that their shelter could become a death trap. Neta begged her friends to leave, but Kim said she couldn’t abandon the trembling Raz.\nLeaving them behind with some 40 other people, Neta stopped a passing car, jumped in as a flurry of shots erupted, and sped away, even as the driver and other passengers got injured by the bullets. They later had to abandon the destroyed car and run and hide before leaving the danger area.\nMeanwhile, Hamas shooters approached the shelter in which Kim and Raz were hiding. They threw in six hand grenades. Then they sprayed them with bullets.\nSince 6:30 that morning, when the rocket alarms sounded, Kim had been in touch with her mother and her police colleagues, sending them her location and asking them to send a rescue team. At 7:58 she texted her boyfriend Lidor Oshri – “Imaleh,” she wrote — meaning “Mommy,” a term used when one is afraid. She also messaged her mother, saying they were being shot at. After that there was no more contact.\nUrged by Kim’s mother, Kim’s father Israel scoured hospitals and the Shura Camp, which was transformed into a morgue in which bodies were being identified, for news of Kim. On the third day, still without news, he set out with friends into the war zone to find his girl, following the location of her cell phone, driving via Netivot and the fields.\nOn the way they were stopped and questioned by soldiers. “I told them I am a father, I want to find my daughter,” Israel said in the interview. They allowed them to proceed. “They told me go, look,” Israel said, adding that the soldiers told him they were not looking for injured people but dealing with the terrorists.\nWhen they got to the shelter, they found body parts (the bodies had been taken to the morgue already) and parts of Kim’s cellphone. But no Kim. For two days they searched the area – shouting out for her in the fields, hoping she was hiding or injured somewhere. Each evening, they returned home, cried, but came back the next morning with renewed hope to continue their search.\nThen at 6 p.m. on Wednesday, after five days of anxious uncertainty, they got a call from Shura Camp informing them that they had identified Kim’s body, Israel said in the interview.\n“I ask myself what made her give up her life and enter the trap of the shelter… the shelter was a trap,” Israel said, his green eyes a reflection of those of Kim. “I guess it was friendship. Friendship. She couldn’t handle a reality… in which a friend is left behind.”\n“A very big part of the life of our family has been taken away,” he added.\nKim’s cousin Meshi Yakovian was interviewed by Channel 14. “She was an amazing girl. She was a fighter…she was brave, she was always the most generous, the nicest…she chose the value of friendship until the last moment,” she said.\nThey grew up together, celebrated parties and Jewish festivals together, just like two sisters, Yakovian said. Kim, she added, went to the Supernova party to have fun and dance and then “she simply didn’t come back. And it hurts. It is hard.”\n“We are a small family,” she added. “To lose one is to lose a whole world…We try to gather strength each one for the other, but we don’t always manage… we try.”\nHer family has raised funds to donate a Torah scroll in her name.\n“My Kim was a walking angel, my first partner and my greatest love, I don’t know how to hurt and cannot cry anymore. I just want her to be proud of me from above,” Lidor, her boyfriend wrote on Instagram.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Don’t shoot me!” before the line went dead. The family believes he encountered Hamas terrorists dressed in IDF uniforms and did not realize until it was too late.\nMark was considered missing for close to a week until his body was found and identified.

He didn’t even think twice before he left the house [that] morning,” his daughter-in-law, Jessica Cohen, told The New York Post. “His whole heart is his family.”\nMaya told a local news outlet that she tried to convince her father to stay put on that day, but he would not be deterred: “He wouldn’t give up and did everything to save me.”\n“He’s a person who has taken care of his family his whole life, his mother, his brothers, his cousins — anyone with a problem calls my dad first because he’s someone who knows how to solve everything,” she said. “I’m not just saying that — he didn’t just go out that morning to save me for no reason, that’s who he is, a person who saves everyone around him.”\nMaya described a loving and embracing father who was always supportive of his three children.\n“My father was a protective man, he and my mother Nirit enveloped us our whole lives,” she said. “Dad always took care of the three of us, we’d never return home to an empty house, he and Mom would always wait up for us. We would go to him with every problem or difficulty.”\nHer parents, she said, were a loving couple: “For Dad, my mother was the most beautiful woman in the world, a perfect creation. Sometimes he would call me just to ask me to send a photo of her. He was her first and only love, they were a match made in heaven, a couple that people would say were ‘glue’ because they were always together… He was her whole life.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

I’ve known him since I’ve been in the pub, he was like my little brother.”\nYuval was also remembered as a devoted fan of the Maccabi Haifa soccer team, which paid tribute to him in a memorial video and at a game, noting that he saw his first match at age 4, and ever since was hooked on the team, despite the distance to the stadium from Kfar Aza.\nHis cousin’s wife, Tammar Truzman, wrote on Facebook that Yuval was a “young guy, stable, handsome, salt of the earth who will be missed by the people, the land, all of us… he was a gift for 29 years.

    "story": "Arye Uzan, 68, and his son Eli Uzan, 42 of Moshav Gilat were murdered by Hamas gunmen along Zikim Beach on October 7.\nThe father and son had arrived at Zikim Beach — one of the more pastoral, beautiful beaches in Israel — in the early hours of that Saturday to go fishing.\nEli’s sister, Yehudit, said that the two went fishing almost every weekend, sometimes at Zikim, sometimes further north in Ashkelon or Nitzanim. She said that at 6:40am on October 7, her mother spoke to Eli and Arye and they said they were taking shelter in a beachside bunker as an intense barrage of rockets blanketed southern Israel.\n“They said that they would wait for the barrage to stop and then they would return and not to worry,” Yehudit said.\nEli was a chef at the Salon Yevani restaurant at the West Hotel in Ashdod and Arye worked as a security officer for the Segev Shalom Regional Council. Yehudit said that a resident of the council, Arye’s assistant, Basem, told her that he spoke to Arye while he hid in the bunker and told him about the heavy barrage hitting the Bedouin communities in the region. Arye told him to hold tight and gave him instructions on what to do until he could make it there to help out. The phone call was suddenly cut short, and that was the last time Arye was heard from.\nThe family did not learn of the fate of Arye and Eli until two weeks later, when their remains were discovered and identified. More than 35 Israelis — civilians and soldiers alike — were killed in the Zikim massacre.\nBoth father and son were laid to rest at the Moshav Gilat cemetery on October 22.\nEli or “Eliko,” was beloved by his co-workers at the Salon Yevani. Owner and chef Guy Peretz told Haaretz that Eli “was my right-hand man for almost 20 years. He was more than a brother to me. A precious and rare man, beloved and special, the type you meet once in your life.”\nOn Facebook, Peretz wrote that when he found out that Eli had gone missing from Zikim Beach, “I was sure that — knowing you — you were palling around with the abductors, speaking to them in Arabic and cooking them food and waiting to return home. I never dreamed you would never be with us again.”\nEli is survived by his wife Limor, and their 12-year-old daughter Lihi. On the day of the funeral, the Salon Yevani issed a statement reading: “Eli was loved by everyone, a man of good deeds, always smiling, a remarkable colleague and companion, and a talented and humane manager. We will all miss him.”\nAryeh Uzan was a father of three, married to Yafah, his widow. On an online memorial site, people who knew him over the years wrote of a kind, caring, man who was always willing to lend a hand.\nAriel Lamdani wrote: “Dear Aryeh, I met you through your work in Segev Shalom. You were always ready to help out in tasks for the residents. I was honored to work with you and know you.”\nShosh wrote “I had the privilege to work with you. A real, noble gentleman.”\nHis granddaughter, Lihi wrote of her grandfather, “You were a strong man, a fighter” but that it wasn’t enough and he was still murdered. In disbelief, she wrote, “Who would believe that you of all people grandpa? Who would believe that this strong, heroic man would be murdered? I hope you protect us from up above, from heaven. I love you, grandpa.”\nChannel 12 news reported that when Hamas terrorists threw grenades into the bunker, Eli twice grabbed grenades and threw them back out at the Hamas gunmen. But he didn’t manage to throw out the third grenade. After it detonated, the gunmen charged into the bunker and shot everyone inside.\nLihi wrote online that a survivor of the attack told her of her father’s heroism, and that he used his own body to shield the people with him.\nIn an Instagram post, Lihi said her father — “my best friend and my angel” — didn’t hesitate to put his own life on the line to save the strangers who took shelter with him in the bunker.\n“My angel, you didn’t think twice you just jumped on the grenade and saved the people with you in the bunker.

People called you a ‘ray of sunshine,'” she wrote.\n“I love you so much, we all love you, there is nobody who didn’t love you. We will take care of your wonderful daughter… who is a hero — it’s all thanks to you Lizi, it’s all due to you. You were an incredible mother to your daughter and you raised her wonderfully.”\nMeir’s mother, Chana wrote on Facebook that “my son, the love of my heart and soul, was murdered along with his wife. They left two orphans, siblings whose hearts are broken, aunts and uncles and friends who are mourning. This day pierced my heart — the day I became a mother who lost two of her sons — Doron, who fell 34 years ago as a soldier in Sayeret Matkal, and Meir, who was murdered in Kibbutz Holit.”\nMeir’s cousin, also named Meir, eulogized the couple on Facebook a day after they were killed.\n“My beloved Meir, you were like a big brother to me on more than one occasion and restrained me more than once as a child when you watched over me during my childhood in a way that always managed to annoy me,” he wrote, noting that the couple’s house became a second home when he was studying in the south, and “we shared the good and the not so good, we gathered happy moments and we always loved unconditionally.”\n“Every conversation with you Lizi and Meir was long and we never wanted it to end out of longing — just now we promised ourselves we would meet up a little more often,” he continued. “My beloved Lizi, I want you to know that Adi did exactly what you asked of her and acted exactly the way you taught her and she was saved because of you.”\n“Meir and Lizi, your love for the country and for its songs will not be understood by outsiders. Thank you for being with us, it is so sad that you left way too soon. We will remember you and what you brought to our world forever.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Eventually, Schem was taken as well but had lost all contact with Toledano. She was released on December 1 as part of the temporary truce deal.\nTwo weeks later, the IDF announced that Israel had recovered Toledano’s body; there were no details on how or when he died.\nMia Schem alongside her family at Sheba Medical Center after being released from captivity, December 1, 2023.

The release of all hostages is our priority,” she wrote on X.\nLoved ones online described his “addictive smile” that made everyone around him happy.\n“My little brother Elia was a man who was full of joy,” said Daniel Toledano, according to Israeli news outlets. “[He was] a symbol of true friendship and endless giving.

A star has been taken from all of us today, without which the sky is incomplete.”\nChildhood friend and Kan 11 political correspondent Michael Shemesh said he will forever remember Toledano’s “sweet smile and kindness.” The two studied together as young men in yeshiva in the Haredi city of Bnei Brak. “We so wanted him to come back. [We wanted] a miracle to happen… rest in peace, Elia Toledano.”\nUntil his body was recovered in December, Toledano was thought to be alive in Hamas captivity. The announcement of his death came as a blow to his loved ones.\n“We are going from hope to despair,” his aunt Viviane told French news outlet TF1 just before the funeral. “The family is really broken. I don’t know if we will ever be able to smile [again].”\n“Every day is like hell for me,” Toledano’s girlfriend, Rina Levi, wrote on Instagram. “When I lost you, I lost everything.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

According to the Be’eri obituary, everyone called Ran “Chepale” although no one could remember where it originated.\nDespite suffering from learning difficulties, Ran finished high school in Ramat Aviv after which he volunteered for IDF service after he was told he didn’t have to serve because he was an orphan.\nAfter his military service, Ran spent years traveling to India, Thailand, and Africa, and Australia among others, settling back in Israel in the early 2010s. When he returned to Israel, he went through different jobs before taking on a position in the kibbutz’s elementary school.\n“I waited a long time for you to come into the world,” sister Lilach wrote on a website dedicated to remembering Ran. “As a boy, you were always smiling and when you grew up, even though you were young when we lost Mom too, you continued to smile and light up the world.”\nRan’s friend from Be’eri, Amos, said that everywhere Ran went, people around him fell instantly in love with him and his energy.\nAmos also described Ran as a “man of infinitive love and heart” who did “less talking and more doing out of generosity and love.”\nThe website was full of posts by members of Be’eri as well as people who had met Ran on his travels and at various music festivals. One of them was Mordechai, who met him at the Supernova festival where Ran was murdered a few hours later.\n“We said to each other,” he wrote, “‘We have peaked in life and in all the good the world has to offer. If we leave the world now, we’ll leave with a smile, we’ll go to God happy and thank him for everything.'”\nA couple of others also said that Ran had told them he wanted to die dancing and happy at a festival.\nMany, like Natasha, who met him in Australia, described Ran as “an amazing soul full of light and the type of person you never forget.”\nLast year, Ran lost a childhood friend, Gal Mills, to cancer.

    "story": "Sgt. Uri Locker, 19, a Golani soldier from Pardes Hanna, was killed battling Hamas terrorists on October 7.\nHe is survived by his parents, Orit and Eyal, and his two brothers, Tamir and Elad.\nOn the morning of October 7, Tamir, Uri’s identical twin, told Israel’s Channel 12 that he felt as though he was being shot in the stomach with Kalashnikov rounds. “Bullet, bullet, bullet, going up, up, up…and then it [was] as though my soul ascended,” he recounted. “And I told my father, ‘Dad, Uri is dead.'”\nThe two had a very strong bond. They were always in the same school class and participated in the same extracurricular activities. When one was hurt or sick, the other could feel the pain. “We never separated for a moment,” Tamir told the media.\nThe twins’ paths diverged for the first time when they joined the IDF at age 18; Tamir joined the Paratroopers Brigade, and Uri went to the Golani Brigade.\nTheir parents instilled in them a love for the State of Israel and a desire to give back to the country from a very young age, Eyal and Orit explained in a video their twin boys made for a high school film class, which documented the boys’ preparation to enlist in combat positions. Eyal is seen in the film conducting physical training exercises with them and describing how his service in an IDF combat unit, for which he was still regularly fulfilling reserve duties, influenced his sons’ choices for their military service.\n“We knew from the moment Uri and Tamir were born that they would follow in their father’s footsteps and serve in combat units,” Orit said in the video published on YouTube in February 2023.\nLocker was stationed near Kibbutz Zikim, and his family told media outlets that he had recently complained of boredom, telling them, “Nothing is going on here.”\nOn the morning of October 7, Locker was on patrol with his company commander and another two soldiers in an armored Jeep. When the fighting began, they were sent to a post near the town of Netiv Ha’asara, where both a tank and a “Namer” armored vehicle had been disabled. The commander went to protect the post itself, leaving the three soldiers to protect the armored vehicles, which had more soldiers trapped inside.\nAccording to Locker’s parents, he and his comrades fought the Hamas onslaught outside Netiv Ha’asara for about an hour and succeeded in killing several terrorists. However, the three of them were eventually overpowered by the sheer number of Hamas combatants, who made their way into Netiv Ha’asara and slaughtered some 20 residents.\nLocker’s family members told Channel 13 that he and his twin shared a love of music, particularly the works of Shlomo Artzi, who came to the shiva.\n“Dear Uri,” wrote his aunt Revital Neeman Yahel on Facebook, “your favorite singer is in the living room of your house coming to visit you.”\nLocker also left behind a girlfriend of nearly three years, Mika, who said at his funeral: “My Uri, my other half… I cannot believe I am talking about you in the past tense. How do we keep going from here?”\n“He was the funniest person ever, really… He knew how to make people laugh. He loved life,” Tamir told Channel 12 in mid-October.\n“My Uri, I miss you,” Orit wrote on Facebook soon after her son’s death. “You were the perfect son who brought us immense pride.”\nLocker’s friends and family described him as a caring friend, loving brother, and son. He was always looking out for others, offering support or cracking a joke to bring up the mood. His mother told media outlets that he dreamed of joining the Shin Bet after his army service.\n“He loved life,” his mother told Israeli radio station 103FM. “He didn’t get to live very much life, but at the same time, he lived so, so much.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She is survived by her parents, Maggy and Benny, and her older sisters Tal and Keren.\nHilly was on the cusp of launching her own clothing brand, named Ashkara, geared toward festival-wear. On October 4, she posted about the upcoming launch event for the brand, slated for October 20 in Tel Aviv — two weeks after she was killed and a week before her 27th birthday.\nA noted dog lover, Hilly served in the Oketz canine unit during her mandatory IDF service. Her sister Keren, who runs a “mutual rehabilitation” farm for animals and humans, told Ynet that she is opening a therapeutic dog park at the farm in her sister’s honor, to help treat people suffering from PTSD.\n“When I would have events at the farm, Hilly was the first to show up,” Keren told Ynet. “When I lived on the farm she would come and we would sit outside so she could cuddle with the animals. She had a special connection to a disabled dog named Nicky, and she said when she moved out of our parents house she would take her with her. Sadly she never got the chance.”\nTal wrote on Instagram that “my little sister, forever best friend and soulmate was viciously murdered by terrorists on October 7. I was her last phone call. I listened in horror as bullets were being shot in her direction.”\nShe wants the world to know about Hilly, wrote Tal, “how she was never meant to be there, how she dedicated her life to bringing joy to others, how big her dreams were — only to be killed by monsters when she least expected it, while laying on the ground helplessly, scared and alone. She felt safe, surrounded by friends and love, and in one unimaginable moment, was taken away from us forever.”\nHilly’s father, Benny, remembered her as having “a passion for life and personal success. Balancing enjoyment, spending time with friends, dancing, laughter, good food, world travels, bungee jumping, and free-fall.” Her “most impressive achievements,” he wrote, “were those against all odds — a challenging military path and establishing a thriving business from scratch within a year. With personal charm, humor, integrity, kindness, and wit, she captured hearts.”\nHer mother, Maggy Solomon, told the Kan public broadcaster that Hilly was a girl “with so many dreams, boundless aspirations, belief in good with enormous willpower and insane joy for life.”\n“Nobody could compete with her willpower, to reach achievements, to conquer every summit,” added Maggie. She noted with “no small irony,” that Hilly’s clothing brand, Ashkara, “specialized in clothing for festivals and nature parties — another dream that ended in a moment. Hilly dreamed big, enjoyed life in a big way, partied, danced, hung out with so many friends — as if she knew that she didn’t have enough time.”\n“Our beautiful and wise Hilly left us too soon because good souls don’t stick around — they arrive, fill up with light, and leave.

The three were part of a tight-knit running club called “Sderot Front Runners.”\nMore than a month later, Hayoun told Maariv that when the rocket sirens started, they joked around but found a place to shelter. He also told Israeli media outlet Ynet that they soon saw and heard Hamas gunmen close by and quickly moved to another sheltered area that was more hidden.\n“Kobi, who hadn’t yet gotten down on the ground, saw [a] terrorist and started running,” Hayoun told Ynet. “The terrorist fired and Kobi fell.”\nAzoulay and Hayoun hid in silence for several hours before an IDF vehicle arrived and they called out for help. “Suddenly,” Hayoun said, “Kobi jumps out of a bush and says to us, ‘Wow, you’re alive! I can’t believe it.'” Paryante had not actually been shot but had led the terrorists to think he had been killed.\nUnfortunately, the IDF soldiers were not able to safely evacuate the trio, so some were assigned to guard them while the others kept going, and eventually, they would come back to take everyone out.\n“Suddenly,” Hayoun told Ynet, “one of the soldiers yells, ‘We’ve been hit.'” After a brief gun battle, the terrorists began throwing grenades. “After the second grenade, we were all already on the ground wounded. A terrorist approached, and Kobi, bleeding, tried to escape again. I heard a bunch of gunshots, then Kobi yelling and falling to the ground.”\nThe terrorist then shot at the other two, who were huddled together, killing Azoulay and severely wounding Hayoun. Eventually, Hayoun was found alive and evacuated from the area.\n“There was something special about him, some kind of magic that everyone loved,” Paryante’s siblings wrote in a Facebook memorial post. “It’s hard to explain in words.

Noam Ben Mucha were slain side by side while attempting to repel an invasion of dozens of Hamas terrorists at the gate of the base. Not far away, their comrade Sgt. Tomer Nagar took up his own position and was also slain.\n“I’m staying here, I’m not going anywhere,” were the last words he said over his walkie talkie before he was killed, according to Makor Rishon.\n“The three of them managed to stop the first wave and killed dozens of terrorists, maybe 50,” the observation soldier who was on duty that morning told the newspaper. “I heard them firing nonstop, volley after volley. It’s bravery I’ve never seen before. Thanks to David, Noam and Tomer we’re here. Without them, everyone on the base would be dead. The three of them looked death in the eyes, the three of them were killed. There’s so much to learn from them, it is a loss for the world.”\nDavid was buried on October 10 in Petah Tikva. He is survived by his parents, Tamar and Avraham, and his eight siblings, Yael, Sara, Yaffa, Hagit, Ayala, Meir, Mali and Shlomit.\nBorn into a Haredi family in the ultra-Orthodox city settlement of Modiin Illit, he decided as a teenager to leave that way of life and enlist in the IDF, a taboo in the ultra-Orthodox world. Officially classified as a “lone soldier” because of his background, he was set up with a religious-Zionist “adoptive” family in Kibbutz Rosh Tzurim.\nLavi Ruziewicz, David’s “adoptive” brother, told Haaretz that he became just like another member of the family.\n“The second time he came to us, he knocked on the door and my mother said to him, ‘When you come home you walk in, you don’t knock.’ I hope he felt connected to us the same way that we felt he was a part of the family.”\nLavi said David “loved to enjoy himself because he felt that he had missed out on so much. It wasn’t always simple, he was impulsive and sometimes did nonsense. He grabbed everything life had to offer with two hands.”\nThe day that his death was confirmed, Lavi said his family went to David’s biological family “and instead of being angry or being jealous that he had spent time with us, his father stood and looked my mother in the eyes and said to her, ‘Now we’re family.'”\nGil Ruziewicz, his “adoptive” father, said that David “wasn’t a guest who came to visit, but really one of us. He took the dog for walks, played backgammon with the kids. We would drop him off at the bus station, take him to the doctor if he needed.”\nDavid’s relationship with his own family was complicated, but they maintained some ties, and his mother even came to his IDF swearing-in ceremony.\nHis parents, Tamar and Avraham, spoke to the Makor Rishon newspaper about their complex relationship and David’s own journey, which was cut short so young.\n“We saw his strong will even when he was a yeshiva student,” said his mother. “The times when he decided to buckle down and study he just did it and got to the top. When he wanted to go to a certain yeshiva, he did everything and got there — same with his decision to go to the army.”\nHis father Avraham said that David “was always a good kid, even when he changed his path, he never [went crazy] or roamed the streets.

He led a happy childhood, and after his parents’ divorce, he moved to Israel with his father’s family. They settled in Beersheba, where Belenky finished secondary school and enlisted in the IDF.

The family lived in Ma’ale Adumim for a time and then moved to Beersheba, where they had two more children, Polina and Daniel.\nWhen they moved again to Ofakim, Belenky took a policing job in nearby Sderot.\nAccording to the Ofakim municipal website, Belenky was finishing a night shift on the morning of October 7. He raced to the police station and fought valiantly to defend it, but he and his fellow police officers were ultimately overpowered by the sheer number of Hamas terrorists and the weaponry they carried.\nSinger Harel Moyal, who served with Belenky in Hebron, said he would light up a room with his smile. “He had the heart of a lion,” Moyal shared, adding that he also fought like a lion, taking down several terrorists before the police station was overrun.\nBelenky was buried on October 9 in the Ofakim Cemetery.\nFriends described Belenky as having a perpetual smile and being an active member of the community wherever he went. Those who worked with him admired his dedication to police work and willingness to lend a helping hand.\n“He had no bad in him,” wrote a colleague on an online memorial posting. “He had a constant smile… He was the officers’ favorite shooting instructor.”\n“You were one of a kind,” another former colleague wrote. “I am so proud of you.”\n“He must have been one of the first to rush toward the terrorists,” wrote Avi Leibovich, who served with Belenky in the IDF, on Facebook. “He was a brave man with a big heart.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She was buried at the Tel Regev cemetery in Kiryat Yam the following day.\nDov loved electronic and trance music and had attended several festivals similar to Nova around the globe.

Omer Wolf, 22, a Golani soldier from Kibbutz Givat Haim (Meuhad), was killed battling Hamas terrorists near Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7.\nHe is survived by his parents, Osnat and Arnon, and two sisters, Yuval and Raz. He was buried on October 11 in the Givat Haim cemetery.\nWolf held the role of deputy company commander within the Golani Brigade’s 51st battalion and was in charge of a number of soldiers.\n“He was incredibly devoted to his soldiers, and they… felt that. They loved him back hugely,” Osnat Wolf told Israel’s Channel 13. \nAt 5:30 a.m. on October 7, Wolf and three other Golani soldiers, Staff Sgt. Shalev Dagan, Staff Sgt. Maru Alem, and Itay Zarbib, piled into a “David” armored vehicle to do a routine patrol along the Gaza border fence.\nThey were the first to encounter the invasion of Hamas terrorists into southern Israel that morning, engaging in battle with a group of them astride motorcycles and pickup trucks. They fought for more than an hour at five different locations, preventing eight terrorists from entering Kibbutz Nirim and succeeding in delaying the invasion by two hours.\nZarbib, the driver of the David and the lone survivor of the four, told Channel 13 that the group saw a terrorist carrying an RPG launcher and tried to dodge the attack. Dagan and Alem were in the back seat; Alem jumped first and was shot dead by the terrorists, Dagan jumped second and returned fire and was hit and killed by the RPG. Zarbib and Wolf, seated in the front, exited the vehicle to fight the terrorists.\nZarbib was shot in the chest and managed to stay conscious long enough to be rescued by a passing IDF vehicle several hours later.\nWolf, however, was found dead near the vehicle having nearly emptied his last cartridge, surrounded by Hamas terrorists he had killed, his mother Osnat told Channel 12 in a January interview.\nAfter his death, Wolf’s parents discovered that he he had secretly been writing songs on his computer that he had not shared with them. His mother Osnat revealed this information to Channel 12 before the broadcast team surprised her with a video from Israeli singer and composer Rami Kleinstein, who had taken it upon himself to finish one of Omer’s songs and perform it.\n“This Omer Wolf was a hell of a writer,” Kleinstein said when he performed the song live a few weeks after the Channel 12 broadcast.\nWolf’s loved ones described him as a quiet, thoughtful person who enriched the lives of those around him.\n“You had a rare combination of charisma, inner peace, modesty, and a touch of shyness,” said Osnat at her son’s funeral. “This combination created an amazing personality — a perfect man, nice, people-loving, smart, generous. A good friend with a good sense of humor — sometimes a bit cynical.”\n“The love that surrounded you flows to us from all directions and fills our hearts with great pride for what a perfect child you are,” she said.\nWolf’s sister Yuval spoke of him as a modest, caring, natural leader with a magnetic presence. “I love you more than anything in the world, my hero brother,” she said.\n“Thank you, [Omer], for being with us for almost 23 years,” his father, Arnon, said in his eulogy. “I know that somewhere, you are beginning a new life.”\nWolf’s girlfriend, Stav Peled, also thanked her late partner for everything he had brought into her life in their short time together. “Thank you for the love that came into my life,” Peled wrote on Facebook in December. “For all the experiences that will always remain ours, for the privilege of knowing Omer Wolf, for the privilege of being Omer Wolf’s partner.”\n“You will forever be a part of my life,” Wolf’s longtime friend Lihi Dahan wrote on Facebook after his passing. “You have always been a part of my heart and it will never be whole again.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

May his memory be a blessing.”\n“Aviv was a hardworking man,” said his friend and former teacher Galia Heller. “Most of the time, he was busy fixing tractors and he worked very hard.”\nAviv was also an artist in his free time, painting scenes from the kibbutz in miniature on tools and pieces of machinery.\n“He didn’t take himself too seriously in his art, he just created honestly and you feel it in his work,” Heller said. “There’s no ego. Aviv was an artist without calling himself an artist. He looked at things differently, he had a good eye and an excellent aesthetic sense.”\nShimon Ben-Shabbat, the owner of a gallery called Raw Art, saw Aviv’s work last year when looking for materials in Nir Oz and fell in love. He exhibited and sold Aviv’s art in his gallery.\n“He had plans for a few projects,” he said. “He created until the last moment. The publicity and recognition for his art came at a time when he in any case needed to reduce his physical work and he told me something that I’ll never forget — ‘I’m lucky that until now I worked with my hands in agriculture, and now I can sit on a chair and work with my hands.'”\nIn a Facebook post in February, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum wrote that Aviv was a “peaceful and calm man with good karma” and that “everyone felt he was their best friend who always found the right words and advice.”\nAviv’s friend Yuval Mazour told Israel Hayom that he always had a smile on his face.\n“He always helped everyone in the kibbutz,” he said. “He was always there for the elderly, always lending a hand and a shoulder. He would always tell the truth.”\nHis wife, Liat, told The New York Times in June 2025 that Aviv was “an exceptional, extraordinary, unbelievable human being… There were very few things about him that annoyed me or that I had criticism of, and they sort of became almost nonexistent.

When the rocket fire began, Ziv texted her father about what was happening, but said she was fine and, “Don’t tell Mom anything.” Several hours later, Ziv texted her mom from Lin’s phone saying: “Mom, we’re in a terror attack, I love you.”\nThat was the last anyone heard from either Ziv or Lin, who were considered missing for close to a week. The inseparable best friends were buried side by side in Kibbutz Ein Hamifratz in back-to-back funerals on October 15.\nZiv is survived by her parents, Daniel and Reuven (Ruvik), and her younger siblings Omri, 19, and Maya, 12.\nShe loved to travel, saving highlights of her recent destinations — Athens, Sinai, Mexico, Colombia, Ecaudor, Guatemala, Panama and more — on her Instagram page. After her mandatory service, which she completed in the police force, Ziv went on a five-month trip abroad to South America with Lin. They returned in May 2023 and she started to work as a waitress at the Roots restaurant in Acre. She was planning to work for a year and save up before starting studies in accounting in 2024.\nOn a memorial site, her parents described her as a “kind and moral girl, with cascading hair, shy and skinny, who grew up and became a girl full of self-confidence, who was always surrounded by friends. She would protect the weak and fight for them stubbornly, a warrior for justice who didn’t allow anyone to harass them,” they wrote, recalling how in high school she led a fundraising effort to give a gift card to the school janitor to buy new clothes. “She filled the lives of those around her with joy and light.”\nHer younger brother, Omri, wrote to “my Ziv, my big sister, my role model, my inspiration. You always were and always will be my big sister, whose life was cut short at 22.”\n“If you can hear me from up there, I want you to know that my love for you has no bounds,” he added. “You always knew how to be there for me, to worry about me, to write to me. Every time I was at work until late you would get annoyed and call or text me asking where I am. Only now, sadly, have I learned to appreciate all the little things you did for me, that you supported me, listened to me, knew how to say the right thing.”\nHer boyfriend, Niv Gavriel, wrote online that the couple had a “fairy tale love story.”\n“We met at work, she was the most beautiful waitress I’d seen in my entire life. I’ll never forget the moment I entered the restaurant and saw her, and life just stopped, for five minutes I couldn’t take my gaze off her,” he wrote. “And since then, for four years, the only thing I wanted was to see her smile.”\nFor the past four years, he wrote, “Ziv made sure to show me how good the world is through her perspective, how important it is to be with family and to check up on them, how important it is to listen to others no matter who they are, and how important it is to know how to forgive because everyone deserves a second chance.”\nHer family said they were struggling to come to terms with her brutal murder so close to home.\n“Ziv was a talented girl, a champion who achieved every goal she set for herself in the best way,” her mother, Daniel, told a local news outlet, noting that she received an award for excellence while serving in the police during her mandatory IDF service. “She was an athlete and hardworking. Over the past year she took life by storm, during her travels she did every extreme [sport] she could, bungee jumping, climbing a volcano, the Carnivale and parties.”\n“Ziv traveled around the world and came home safe,” her mother added. “And here, in our home in the Land of Israel, she was brutally murdered.

Two other friends of the sisters, Inbar Shemtov and Shir Georgy, were also slain alongside Amit.\nAccording to a eulogy on the Holon municipal site, Amit attended the Kiryat Sharet High School and then enlisted in the IDF and served in a combat unit stationed in the Jordan Valley, later also serving in reserve duty.\nAmit and Shani had been saving up money to go on an extended trip around South America and had already purchased tickets slated to depart on December 17, according to a local news site.\nHer friend, Noam Bar Tal, wrote on Instagram of their memories together: “Laughing with you until we can’t breathe, dancing with you until we can’t stand on our legs, speaking with you for hours without noticing that time has passed.”\nShe used to imagine, she wrote, “sitting together with you on the couch at age 90 and smoking a joint and reminiscing about all of our memories from our lives together. Dreaming with you about the future. We’ve been friends as long as I can remember, and I don’t know what my life is like without you.”\nIn December, Shani posted a tribute on social media to “my twin sister, my best friend.”\n“The most considerate, most charismatic and most gentle girl,” she wrote. “You brought only good to the world my angel. An incredible girl whose unique beauty and smile can be seen from afar, and whose joy for life will stay with me forever. You were too good for this world. I was privileged to be your twin sister for 22.6 years in which we were inseparable, I got to experience absolutely everything with you, only twins will understand this crazy connection.”\nShani recalls: “Being together with you until your very last breath, I saw you fight and not give up until it was too much, until your strength ran out, until your gentle and pure soul couldn’t take it anymore.”\nShe wrote, “I am choosing to believe that things are good for you and that you and Mom are together, catching up in the highest spot in heaven. I know I have the highest protection possible, nothing can break us, Amiti! You and I know that better than anyone.”\n“A whole life I experienced with you,” Shani continued. “And a whole life is beginning without you. You’ve left a hole in my heart in the shape of you. You’ll accompany me always, in every step and every breath. Everything you didn’t get to do, my love, I promise you, that I will live your life as the person who knew you best in the world!”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She also sang in every Remembrance Day ceremony when she was in school.\nRavit’s fellow Border Police officer Staff Sgt.

Krief managed to send a short video from the bathroom to his friends, in which loud gunfire can be heard just outside.\nHis father tried to head to the beach to find him but was turned back by security forces. By the time he made it to the scene, the only thing he found there was his son’s abandoned car.\nShahaf’s body was found and identified only several days later, and he was buried on October 12 in Gilat.\nHe is survived by his parents, Shlomi and Rita, and his three older siblings Inbar, Shai and Shontal.\nShahaf was a senior at the Rabin High School in Beersheba when he was killed. He grew up on the family’s horse farm and was an avid horse lover and very active in the stables. He also spent a great deal of time at Zikim Beach and loved to hang out there with friends until the early morning hours.\n“He was my right-hand man in the stables,” his father, Shlomi, told Channel 14 in an interview several months after his death. “That was his dream, that he’d have his own stables, and he could raise horses.”\nSince he was murdered, the site has become a memorial to their beloved son.\n“This is what he loved,” his mother, Rita, told the TV station. “Someone needs to continue in his path.”\nShlomi told a local Beersheba news site that on what would have been his 18th birthday in January, hundreds of his loved ones went to his gravesite and then marched together to the stables in his memory.\nSince his death, his parents said, they have been unable to return to their lives and to recover from the shocking loss.\n“Even though I was the one who identified his body, and I was the one who buried him, I still expect him to knock on the door and come in,” said his father. “I’m hoping for him to even show up in my dreams because he just disappeared.”\nShlomi said Shahaf was always looking out for others, recalling how he met a boy along the beach one time and offered to throw him a bar mitzvah party there with horses and motorcycles to make him happy, and how he would bring troubled youth to the stables to try and give them structure and responsibility.\nShahaf doted on his nieces and nephews, he said, “and would drop them off and pick them up from school and take care of them. Now I can’t stop spoiling them, because I know how much he loved them.”\n“This is a boy who schooled me and taught me how to behave,” Shlomi said of his son. “I could never say no to him. When he was 10 he wrote a whole post [online] about how you shouldn’t ostracize other kids and you always have to help kids in trouble. He was only 10, and he cared so much.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She was buried on October 10 in Haifa.\nA redhead with a beaming smile, Alina was a combat soldier in the search and rescue team of the Home Front Command, and was the officer on duty at the Urim base on that fateful Saturday morning.\nShe had stayed on in the IDF past her mandatory service period, had signed on to stay until 2027, and had successfully completed an officer’s course.\nWhen the terrorists invaded the base, they cornered Alina and her team of soldiers in the war room. After Hamas gained access to the room while launching a grenade, Alina was killed while trying to protect herself and her soldiers in the battle that ensued. Two soldiers who were wounded but survived, later recounted the events, according to Magen David Adom, where Alina volunteered for four years.\nHer family and friends are now collecting funds to donate an ambulance in her name to MDA. Loved ones said she dreamed of one day becoming a doctor.\nLavi, who volunteered alongside her in MDA for years, told the Davar news outlet that “she was just wonderful. Wonderful. The kind who manages to do so many shifts a week, as many hours as possible, always at her best. Always excelling. It’s not a cliche — it was like this because she simply cared.”\nHer parents, Olga and Michel immigrated to Israel from Ukraine in the late 90s, hoping to find a better future in their new homeland.\nDubbed “Gingit” by her friends because of her flaming red hair, friends and family remembered Alina as a person who was always prepared to help others, who set the highest standards for herself and fought for just causes. She loved ballet and Aikido, for which she trained at a center in Haifa run by her grandparents.\nHer boyfriend, Raz, who was himself wounded during his active service on October 7, wrote to her: “My dear Alina, you were an incredible person, from the very first moment I saw you I fell in love. We spoke about dreams, aspirations, a future. When they told me [you had been killed], I broke down. I am now a broken man.”\nA video made in her memory by Amit Inbal, shows pictures of her over the years: in school, wearing a pink sweatshirt, horsing around with friends, noticeable because of her very fair skin enshrined by the red hair; dancing in the desert; hugging her little brother; graduating from high school with a pale blue evening dress, holding a red rose.\nThe images of her in the army depict her armed and in uniform, her hair tied up in a tight ponytail; dancing while cleaning the barracks, squeegee in hand; asleep on a bus. There is also an image of her on holiday, lying on her back in the shade of a tree, framed by green leaves, with her hair spread out over a blue-and-white striped mat. “You were gentle and a fighter,” the video ends. “You were a rose in the desert.”\n“Alina always wanted more than she could,” her father, Michael, told the Davar news outlet. “And it always worked out for her.”\nHe said that she danced ballet for years, always worked out and engaged in sports, “she had all the components for excellence, and she anyway kept going and stuck with it and became better than anyone. She really was like that, the best of everyone.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

A supportive shoulder and a partner for life.”\nIn a news interview, his mother, Fani, described his final moments and the last time she saw him.\n“He took the initiative, he ran to the weapons locker, brought two machine guns, ran with them, brought it to his friend, and the two of them fought with bravery until their last drop of blood,” his mother, Fani, told Channel 12 news.\nFani said she last saw Noam on Friday, a few hours before he was killed, when she brought him food for Shabbat to his IDF base: “I saw him and I was so proud of him and I said ‘Noam, I’m so proud of what you’ve become,’ and he hugged me, and it was as if he was saying goodbye.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Shalev Madmoni, 24, of Rosh Ha’ayin, and her boyfriend Guy Levi, 24, of Neve Yamin, were murdered by Hamas terrorists while trying to flee the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nThe couple left the site of the festival when the rocket fire began, and decided to head toward friends who lived nearby to let things calm down before driving home. Their families believe they were slain along the road as they tried to flee.\nGuy’s body was discovered after about a week, while Shalev’s body took close to 10 days to recover and identify.\nGuy was buried on October 15 in Neve Yamin. He is survived by his parents, Orit and Nitzan, his siblings Mor and Shira, and his grandparents.\nShalev was buried on October 17 in Rosh Ha’ayin. She is survived by her parents, Ilanit and Peretz, her siblings Osher, Shaked and Shai, and her grandparents.\nThe couple were slated to move in together just days after the festival, their families said, and they had already set up and furnished an apartment and were just putting in the finishing touches before settling in.\nThey both loved the game footvolley, and their loved ones held a local tournament in December in their memory, and even sold volleyballs engraved with their faces and signatures to memorialize them.\n“Shalev was a peaceful girl, like her name,” her aunt, Ayala, told a local news outlet. “She had the wisdom and knowledge to reach the destinations she wanted and the goals she set for herself in her own quiet way without a lot of talk.”\nAyala said that Shalev “always respected her parents, and had an endless love for Guy, her boyfriend. They were supposed to move in together and had already set up an apartment. We even ordered some appliances for them. It wasn’t meant to end this way, it’s a huge loss.”\nShalev’s mother, Ilanit, wrote on Facebook several months after she was killed: “Our Shalevi, a girl with a huge soul, loved and loving, peaceful and pleasant, always surrounded by friends.”\nShalev, she wrote, “loved to go out, parties, trips, didn’t pass up her ‘big trip’ in South America where she collected dozens more friends who enjoyed her presence. She was always helping, listening and accepting, she hated fights and gossip.”\nShe was “the kind of daughter who wouldn’t leave without checking on mom and dad, helping mom finish all the chores so it wouldn’t be too hard for her. A helping sister, attentive and beloved… you ended your life with your boyfriend who was the love of your life, you were a heavenly couple — a once in a lifetime love.”\nGuy’s sister, Shira, wrote on Instagram that since his death, “there will always be a huge, enormous hole in my heart, because some terrorist decided to take my brother, Guy, and Shalev, his girlfriend who to me was like the sister I never had.”\n“You don’t even know what kind of figure of pride you were to me and always will be,” she continued. “How every song you played in the car, I would do ‘Shazam’ without you knowing to play it later for my friends. How about everything, I would say what Guy would have done.”\nHer brother, lived life, she said, “so strongly, as if he knew that he had only 24.5 years on earth.”\nShira wrote that her dream “was to find a love like you and Shalev had, five years of endless love, mutual and perfect love. The one thing that comforts me is that you’re together now, continuing to love.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Chana Kritzman, 88, was fatally wounded by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7 and succumbed to her wounds two weeks later, on October 21.\nShe and her husband were both wounded by gunfire from terrorists while they were being evacuated from the kibbutz after more than 24 hours of hiding out in their safe room. His wound was minor and he survived, while Chana fought for two weeks before dying in hospital.\nShe was buried on October 24 in Kibbutz Einat. She is survived by her husband, Zvi “Tziki” Kritzman, their four children, Tzafrir, Zohar, Noga and Ziv, as well as 12 grandchildren and and 10 great grandchildren.\nBorn in Warsaw, Poland, in 1935, she came to Israel as a baby with her parents who recognized the growing tide of antisemitism in Europe. At age 15, according to a kibbutz eulogy, she moved to Be’eri as part of a youth movement aimed at building up the fledgling kibbutz.\nThere they lived in tents, worked the land and helped turn the kibbutz into a thriving community. She also met her future husband there, and the couple wed and raised their four children in the kibbutz. Chana worked for decades in education in the kibbutz and was best known for establishing the Be’eri library, and working to instill her love of reading in generations of children.\nThe National Library of Israel noted in a post on Facebook that “the wonderful Chana’le raised her children and grandchildren on a love of books, reading and the art of storytelling,” sharing a photo of her reading to her young son in Be’eri decades ago. “Her great love of books she spread like a magical dust across the kibbutz, in different educational roles… throughout her life, she read an innumerable number of books to an innumerable number of children, who grew up to be parents and grandparents themselves.”\nHer nephew, Ori Ben Dov, wrote on X that his aunt was “an optimistic woman who always believed that tomorrow would be better… she came to Be’eri in 1949 when it was just a pile of sand, and watched it grow and thrive and bloom, and was so very proud of her Be’eri.”\nOn her coffin at her funeral, her family placed her favorite children’s book, “Children’s Island,” by Mira Lobe, and a book of crosswords, which she always loved.\nHer grandson, Omer Keren, noted that while she was hospitalized and fighting for her life, her great-grandson was born in the very same hospital, a few floors away, and his brit mila was held the day she died. He was named Or, meaning light.\nKeren described his grandmother as “an 88-year-old woman who for two weeks fought a serious gunshot wound from a bullet fired by terrorists while she was being evacuated from Kibbutz Be’eri, on the alley heading toward the cafeteria, 100 meters from her house. Only a bullet could stop this woman, and even that — not easily.”\nHe said that the family had “the privilege of being able to say goodbye to her. To stand around her, to stroke, to kiss her, to tell her so many times that we love her.”\nChana, he wrote, “was the most optimistic person in the world. She went through difficult things in life, and still, in the hardest moments, when you would ask how she was, she would answer, ‘Tomorrow will be better.'” His grandmother, Keren wrote, “was a legendary educator who never studied education, but she simply knew that punishment was not an educational tool. That a child needs love, to be spoken to at eye level, to be looked at with kind eyes.”\n“She knew millions of children’s books by heart and knew how to tell them so that everyone would listen,” he added, noting that she was the type of grandmother “who sent via mail mishloach manot on Purim and dried fruit on Tu Bishvat. Who made cholent and shared it with the neighbors. Who would never say ‘no’ and always agreed to go on any adventure.” These days, he imagined, “Savta would say that the only medicine is to smile, to keep creating, loving, and to rebuild.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

On the way he encountered a cell of terrorists and was shot dead from short range.\nHe was buried on October 12 in Ofakim, just four days before his 21st birthday and a week before he was slated to finish his IDF service.\nHe is survived by his parents, Hedva and Motti, and his siblings Yanir, Nissim and Hili.\nAccording to a eulogy on the Ofakim municipal website, it was important to Nadav to serve in a meaningful combat position in the IDF, and he dreamed of opening his own business after he finished his mandatory service.\nHis older brother, Yanir, wrote on Instagram about lighting a torch in his memory at a ceremony for the Kfir Brigade: “I will always be with you in my heart and my soul. To bring you up everywhere I go. And always to proclaim your name, Nadav Biton, as a hero who was never afraid of anything. Who loved his surroundings and always worried about others before he did himself. My little brother Nadav, I love you, I always loved you and I will always love you.”\nIn February, his girlfriend Tali Shpital, counted “125 days without you, 19 Shabbats that you are not with me.”\n“125 days that I don’t get to see your beautiful and addictive smile, 125 days that I don’t get to hear your laugh that I love so much. 125 days without your bear hug, without your beautiful voice,” she continued.\n“My love, thank you for our wonderful time together, thank you for nights full of laughter, thank you for all the experiences, thank you for your constant support, thank you for not letting me fall and never letting me feel alone, thank you for the hugs and the kisses and your love.”\nA month after he was killed, his mother Hedva wrote on Facebook about her overwhelming grief and pain over his loss.\n“Thank you for every moment you were with me in this life. Thank you for being mine,” she wrote. “I’m proud of the boy you were. The man you were. With the biggest heart in the world. You left an empty world, my love. I hope I gave you everything you wanted,” she continued.\n“My prince, my love, I enjoyed every moment I had with you in life but it wasn’t enough for me,” Hedva wrote. “We were supposed to have so many more. And certainly, you were supposed to bury me and not I you… goodbye, my angel in heaven.

He was buried on October 11 on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.\nHe is survived by his wife, Shira, their three children, Tzuri, 7, Tair, 5, and Hadar, 2, as well as his parents, Rachel and Yisrael, and five siblings: Noga, Gideon, Tzila, Ariel and Leah.\nRaziel and the other members of the kibbutz’s security team gathered early that morning when the rocket fire began, and split up into pairs to battle against the invasion of the Hamas terrorists of the small kibbutz, situated only around 100 meters from the Gaza border.\nIn the ensuing gun battles, Raziel was slain alongside his friend and fellow local security team member Amichai Witzen, after eliminating terrorists who had holed up inside a family home. The rest of the kibbutz was saved and later evacuated alive, though two were seriously wounded.\n“The others told us how Yedidya led them, how he leaped forward without thinking twice,” his wife Shira told Israel Hayom. “He was an exceptional commander, never unwilling to fight. He was a family man with clear priorities, with a sense of humor, with kind eyes. He always did everything as best as he could.”\nRaziel grew up in the West Bank settlement of Psagot and studied social work at the Ashkelon Academic College. He worked as a social worker with the Kidum organization which runs a series of rehabilitation programs. He was also pursuing a master’s degree in couples and family counseling.\nHis family moved to Kerem Shalom as part of a group of religious Zionist emissaries to help shore up the struggling kibbutz, which in 2023 consisted of more than 60 families, compared to around just a dozen in 2010.\nHis father, Rabbi Yisrael Rosenberg, told a memorial lecture that his son had “two main characteristics: On the one hand, he was a man of religion, of Torah… On the other hand, he had a spirit of freedom, he was great at sports, he loved exploring, swimming, games.”\nSeveral months after he was slain, his wife, Shira, told the Srugim website that being informed that he had been killed that day had seemed surreal.\n“He wasn’t in the army or the image of a hero, he’s a social worker, a family man, sensitive, gentle,” she said. “He was also a very heroic fighter [in the army], but that wasn’t in his script. He was suited to be a very old man with grandchildren. He was pursuing a master’s degree in therapy and it was his dream to be a therapist,” his wife said.\n“He worked in mental health, he had the soul of a counselor, you could rely on him, we had conversations for hours about everything,” she said.\nMonths after he was killed, she said, “I’m still in pain and grieving and I’m not looking to leave it — it hurts, it’s hard, he is missing.”\n“But I still want to talk about him and to hear about him, that’s where I want to be,” she added. “That’s where I feel I’m in the right place.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She was buried on October 12 in Beit Dagan.\nAccording to a eulogy on the Holon municipal website, Shani studied music in high school and was a “talented singer” as well as a designer and seamstress.\nShani worked as a waitress at the 2C restaurant in Tel Aviv and also performed around the country with the “Pupik” entertainment troupe. She loved to travel and had saved Instagram highlights from all of her recent trips abroad — NYC, Greece, Sinai, London and Barcelona.\nShe had a particular love of Purim, always designing and sewing her own costumes. Ahead of this year’s celebration, her friend Daniella Aperlev spoke to Army Radio about the initiative in her memory to collect and donate Purim costumes to those in need.\n“Shani and I have been friends since age 12,” Aperlev told the radio station. “We were five friends, we grew up together in Holon, and Shani was the most unique possible. She was a person whose life goal was to be happy, to make others happy, and to do good. I can’t perfectly describe her.”\nAperlev said Shani would sew costumes for all her friends each Purim and also sell them to others, “always doing hers last, right when we had to walk out the door because she wanted to make sure everyone else was happy and satisfied first.”\nShani’s sister, Ortal Ben Ami, wrote on Instagram that as a child “I waited nine years for you to arrive, and you did. The most beautiful present I ever received. But I didn’t know it was for such a limited time. Only for 27 years.”\nOrtal wrote that she, Shani and Nofar were always a “trio, everyone was jealous of our unique connection — something in the funny and stormy dynamic, something in our differences that just worked. Anything that happened to one of us we would immediately share with the others, our travels together, our parties. We always helped each other.”\nAnd now, she wrote, “You will no longer accompany me through the different stations of my life, and I won’t accompany you… I promise to do everything so that we can recover as a family and be happy and travel because that’s what you would have wanted. We will immortalize you so that everyone will know what a loss it was to the world.”\nOne thing gives me some comfort, wrote Ortal, “that in your final moments, you were surrounded by nature, by friends that you loved, and that you laughed until you cried.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She said that Liam and his friends — Yonatan Zeidman and Ilai Baram — arrived at the rave only shortly before the rocket fire began. All three were slain as they tried to later flee the partygrounds.\nSimona told Maariv that “I spoke to them until 30 seconds before they were killed. They were happy, they didn’t know what was going on, this is my comfort, this is my strength,” she said, noting that a cell of terrorists shot all three dead from the side of the road.\n“Liam was a happy boy, he didn’t go to sleep sad once in his 26 years. He went to sleep happy and woke up happy. He was a kid with dreams,” she told the newspaper. She noted that he wanted to serve in a combat unit in the IDF, and as an only child his mother would have to approve such a move, and she refused for six months before caving.\nAfter his mandatory service in the Netzah Yehuda Battalion, Liam traveled around the world and returned to study business administration at Reichman University, where he was slated to begin his third year shortly after he was killed. He had landed an internship at Pricewaterhouse Coopers, and also led his own initiative, called Splash Project, to get local artists to paint sports fields and community centers around the country. His mother has vowed to continue the initiative in his memory.\nSimona told La’isha magazine that she is not angry or demanding answers about the death of her son, but is trying to continue to live alongside the grief: “Every morning, I wake up, I go into his room, I smell his sheets, I scream, I cry, and then I return to reality,” she said. “The sorrow in me is deep and I can’t explain it.”\nIn a memorial video for Channel 13, his close friend Ben Savir paid tribute to his “dear friend, an incredible figure.”\nBen said he knew Liam growing up, but they became close while both attended Reichman: “From the first day of the degree we grabbed each other and didn’t let go until a month ago,” he said. “Even though you were only six months older than me, you were like a big brother to me, and our connection was based mostly on you directing and guiding me, but mostly laughing at me.”\nHe and Liam, he said, had a sense of “healthy competition. We were never jealous of each other but we pushed each other forward to be better. At least that’s how I felt… Your aspirations, your goals, your achievements, were unique and for me served as a sort of mirror for how a successful person should think and behave,” he said. “You were one of the few people my age I admired.

She is survived by her parents, Keren and Moshe, and her brothers Yonatan and Ben.\nHer younger brother, Ben, 12, wrote on Instagram that his sister had “the most perfect laugh, we called you ‘shikuti‘ at home because you always wanted us to kiss you and to pay attention to you and you succeeded in that. You were always here for us, I love you always and I am sure that you are in heaven and sitting in the chair of honor like a true queen. I love you a lot, you are the best sister I had in my life, a sister who everyone looked at and loved.”\nHer father, Moshiko, told the Kan public broadcaster that his daughter “really wanted to be an observation soldier, really wanted to serve the country.”\n“Yam was a girl of fields, Yam didn’t hang out in the malls,” said Moshiko. “She rode on horses, she ran barefoot through the wheat fields.”\n“She was so vibrant, she was blossoming, she was goal-oriented,” he said.\nShe had a sewing machine at home, he added, “she would sew, her room was full of pictures of clothing that she designed,” he said, noting that a manufacturer was planning on producing a line of swimwear she designed in her memory.\nYam’s older brother, Yonatan, wrote on social media, “Our Yami, you were so strong, you had such a strong soul, our Yam, the queen of the house. We grew up togther, we rode horses together, motorcycles, everything you can imagine, we were driving vehicles since age 0 together. We did everything together, we always had each other.”\nHe said that Yam would always tell him, “Yonatan, we live every day and we die only once.” His sister, he said, “was brave, with a pure heart… always looking to help.”\n“I promise you that every second I am on this earth will be to make you proud of me, as long as I am breathing I will memorialize you and speak about who you were to me and to the family and to everyone,” he said.\n“I will love you forever, and I know that you are waiting for me at the end with your cheeky smile and your arms open for a hug,” Yonatan continued. “My little sister, Shirat Yam Amar, I salute you. I had the honor and privilege of being your big brother for 18 years — and forever.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Maru Alem, 20, a Golani Brigade soldier from Ashkelon, was killed while battling Hamas terrorists near Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7.\nAt 5:30 a.m. on October 7, Alem and three other Golani soldiers, Cpt. Omer Wolf, Staff Sgt. Shalev Dagan, and Itay Zarbib, climbed into a “David” armored vehicle to conduct a routine patrol along the Gaza border fence.\nThey were the first to encounter the invasion of Hamas terrorists into southern Israel that morning, engaging in battle with a group of them astride motorcycles and pickup trucks. They fought for more than an hour at five different locations, preventing eight terrorists from entering Kibbutz Nirim and succeeded in delaying the invasion by two hours.\nZarbib, the driver of the David and the lone survivor of the four, told Channel 13 that the group later saw a terrorist carrying an RPG launcher and tried to dodge the attack. Dagan and Alem were in the back seat; Alem jumped first and was shot dead by the terrorists, Dagan jumped second and returned fire and was hit and killed by the RPG.\nZarbib and Wolf, seated in the front, exited the vehicle to fight the terrorists; Zarbib was shot and wounded and later rescued, while Wolf was shot and killed.\nAlem is survived by his parents, Yigavel and Gevaria, and his five siblings. He was buried on October 12 in Ashkelon.\nAlem and his family moved to Israel from Ethiopia in 2012, when he was 11 years old, and they spent two years in an absorption center in Sderot before moving to Ashkelon. Two of his siblings remained in Ethiopia, and his family fought for months to allow one of them, Tamar, to remain in Israel, finally winning the battle in February — with assistance from Joel Dagan, the father of Maru’s fallen comrade Shalev.\nAt his funeral, a Golani officer recounted, “Maru, you practiced, you excelled, you took part in many operations, charging ahead and taking responsibility. You were quiet, modest, a good friend with a huge heart. You were a brave and strong fighter.”\n“You served as a role model for the entire company, in particular the young people who joined it,” he continued, noting that most of his comrades could not attend the funeral as they were continuing the fighting.\nMaru’s sister, Rivka, wrote on an Ashkelon memorial site that “Maru was a magical child with a smile that can’t be described. He was generous, considerate, one who made sure to help anyone who needed it. His smile was everything — just seeing it would make you understand what a good person he was, glowing every place he went.”\nRivka wrote that “it’s not possible to describe in words what a person he was… friendly, funny, introverted, pure, there’s nobody who didn’t love him, he never did anything bad to anyone, he had a contagious laugh that nobody will forget.”\nHer brother, she said “was a perfect boy, a brother who never left anyone behind, always checked in on his siblings, made sure they were not lacking anything — respecting his parents was his top priority, he never forgot his family…. He loved my mother and he always wanted and wants to see my mother happy.”\nHis mother, Yigavel, told Kan that “it’s hard because my son died before his time, not from disease or old age… it’s not easy, it’s so hard,” she said. “My beloved Maru, why did Maru have to die?”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was finally buried on October 25 in Omer — just a few days before what should have been his 30th birthday.\nHe is survived by his parents, Tova and Eli, and his three older sisters, Efrat, Michal and Tamar.\nNir did a year of national service at a kibbutz in the Arava before enlisting in the IDF and serving in the Nahal Brigade, according to Ynet. For the past two years, he was living in Tel Aviv and working at the med-tech startup TytoCare. Just a few weeks before they were both slain, Nir and Shai moved in together in Tel Aviv.\nOn what would have been his 30th birthday, Shai’s mother, Efi, shared a dedication that she found in Shai’s phone that she was planning to post that day: “The man that I will grow old with is taking a significant step toward our future today, and celebrating 30 years of perfection,” Shai wrote, not long before they were both killed. “The universe, and all of you, don’t know what angel is among us. Thank you for the biggest love my heart has known, for the humor that is only ours, for your ability to listen and accept and for your unwavering emotional intelligence. Nobody else has a great love like ours, but that’s something only we know.”\nNir’s close friend, Jonathan Lahat, told Ynet that “Nir and Shai were a happy and in-love couple, they were supposed to fly this month to Madrid to celebrate their relationship and his birthday,” he said. “Instead, we — his friends — celebrated without him at a bar in Tel Aviv with beer and a lot of tears.”\nLahat said that in his current job, “Nir was praised and promoted very quickly, and he also registered for philosophy studies and was satisfied with his ability to successfuly combine all of his loves. He was in the best time of his life, and everything was cut short in one fell swoop.”\nHis mother, Tova, told Channel 12 news that Nir “was in the midst of an incredible time in his life, he had been wandering between different sales job abroad and when he returned to Israel, he was accepted to TytoCare and really succeeded and got alot of praise and a raise in salary.” At the same time, she said, he “met his incredible girlfriend, and it looked like it was going to be serious, they were talking about forever, and the romance was blossoming.”\nTova said Nir “was a child who gave us so many moments of happiness, he was very, very social, even to the degree that at times we were annoyed that he dedicated so much time to his friends, but now we realize that he was the anchor for so many friends in different circles.”\nNir’s sister, Tamar, wrote on Facebook on January 1 that “I cannot accept that your heart is no longer beating.”\n“I am flooded with waves of pain that hurt my chest — maybe in the same exact place they shot you,” she wrote. “I move around in circles and always return to the same spot — longing for your voice, your smell, your laugh, for the Nir who was mine.”\nTamar wrote that Nir “was left behind like a pillar of salt in cursed soil, and I am continuing forward in time to 2024, clinging to crumbs of spirit and corporeality, telling myself a story that will ease my mind. But you’re not here with me, in what is left of life. And all that I can do is to hallucinate you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

So don’t worry, on every one of my birthdays, I will remember that it is also your day.

An exemplary fighter, and a gifted Negevist, who knew how to act just like a commander,” Sarit said. “He was always a unique son and brother, today we understand that he was our shoulder. He became a quiet and humble young man, who liked to be in his own corner. Not for one second would he ever forget to say thank you for every little thing that was done for him.”\nSarit said that “not a day would go by that he wouldn’t ask how we are, and calm us that everything was great for him… We will forever remember our hero, who protected us with his body.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Ilkin Nazarov, 29, from Kiryat Yam, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHe was initially declared missing, with his family having seen videos of him hiding inside a trash bin with a group of partygoers, according to a 104.5FM radio interview on October 9 with his cousin Zarina. Nazarov sent a message to his father on the morning of the attack, saying he was hiding, and then lost contact.\n“Dad, don’t worry, we’re hiding inside a container,” he wrote. “I love you.”\nHis body was identified within a few days of the massacre, according to a local northern Israel news report.\nAccording to his cousin Eran Golaev, whose eulogy was posted on social media and local news sites, terrorists may have thrown a grenade into the container where Nazarov was hiding. However, the official cause of death was not made known to the public.\n“You were always smiling, you were always kind. You never fought with anyone,” Golaev said at the funeral.\n“I wrote to the other cousins that we would have a party in honor of your return and today, really, everyone was there. All the family and friends. But it’s not because you came back — certainly not in the way we wanted.”\nNazarov was an only child and is survived by both his parents as well as his extended family. “Please watch over your parents,” Golaev said. “They have no other child but you.”\nHe was “the center of his parents’ world,” according to close friend and roommate Vika Ostrovksy, who eulogized Nazarov on social media.\nAccording to her, Nazarov was “the most loyal to his friends and family, ready to go to other ends of the Earth in times of need.”\n“The meaning of his name in his native language is ‘first,'” Ostrovsky wrote. “He was definitely one and only. Always smiling. In my eyes, he was an angel on Earth.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

His body was sent back to Nepal and arrived there on October 22. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Mahakali River in the Kanchanpur district in a religious ceremony a day later.\nBist was one of 10 Nepali students studying and working in Israel who were murdered that day. The group ran to a bomb shelter when the rocket fire began, and were slaughtered inside by a group of Hamas terrorists.\nSurvivor Dhanbahadur Chaudhari told the Guardian that the terrorists threw grenades inside the bunker and fired volleys of bullets: “When I woke up I was covered in blood and I could see my friends dead and injured around me. One friend didn’t have legs, another didn’t have hands. There were dead bodies of my friends in the door of the bunker.”\nAnother survivor, KC Pramod, told the Guardian: “We started shouting ‘We are Nepali, we are Nepali’ but they didn’t listen to anyone, they just kept firing and threw two grenades into the bunker.”\nBist was among 265 Nepali students studying in Israel under an 11-month “Learn and Earn” program, who had all arrived only a few weeks before the Hamas onslaught, though they were not all situated near the Gaza border.\nAccording to the Nepali Times, Raj was his family’s sole caregiver after his father Ashok died of cancer. He was pursuing a degree in agriculture at Far-Western University in Tikapur Kailali, Nepal.\nThe newspaper reported that his mother, Parwati Bist, fainted after hearing the news of his death.\n“He used to call our mother every evening,” Dipesh’s sister Mamata told the news outlet. “But when we called him on Saturday we could not reach him and started getting really worried.”\nMamata recalled her late brother as being “brilliant and studious,” and seeking to earn money to help their younger brother pay for medical school.\nHis grandfather, Hariraj Bist, told the Naya Patrika Daily that his grandson “had a desire to pursue public service in his country.”\n“Dipesh Raj thought that he should do something in his country rather than abroad,” his grandfather added, noting that “he went to a foreign land” to gain experience and skills before his return home. “Our family has been hit by thunder.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Bar Manshuri, told Ynet that Mor went up on the roof of the Sderot police station to shoot at terrorists down below until she ran out of ammunition: “She reported to me that the ammo had depleted, unfortunately, I couldn’t help and arm them, I wrote to her that we were fighting a horrible endless battle [inside the station]. While she was in danger and fighting for her life, she wrote to me, ‘Bar, be strong.’ Even in this extreme moment, she thought of others and not herself.”\nSupt. Mali Shoshana, who was on the roof that day with Mor, told Channel 12 news that while they were up there, a Defense Ministry employee was wounded and Mor removed her shirt, tore it and used it as a tourniquet: “Mor fought bravely under fire and treated a wounded person,” she said. “I met Mor back when I served for four years in the Ashkelon police station — a dedicated officer, professional, excellent, beloved by all, authoritative, sensitive and very humane. This is a huge loss.”\nShe was buried on October 10 in Sderot. She is survived by her parents, Ayala and Roni, her sister Sapir, and her fiance David.\nHer mother, Ayala, told Channel 12 that Mor called her that morning and said, “Mom, it’s important to me that you know that if I don’t survive, I love you, I love dad, take care of my sister,” she recounted. “I know Mor, she would say, ‘I’ll go down fighting.’ She never gave up. If she was the scared type, she’d be alive with me here… with all the pain, I’m proud of her that she protected us.”\nMor was born and raised in Sderot, and served as a trainee commander on an IDF training base next to Pardes Hanna during her army service, before joining the police force approximately six years ago. While serving at the Ashkelon police station, she met David, a fellow police officer, and they got engaged a few months before she was killed. The couple was planning a June wedding.\nDavid told Channel 12 that Mor fought hard “and protected the citizens of the south. It’s not something that is comforting or will bring her back to us, but it gives us strength, that in the end she fought until her last moment and was a hero.”\nHer sister, Sapir, told La’isha magazine that “Mor was my BFF, my best friend, she always worried about me, was always there for me in hard times.”\n“Everyone who knew her would describe her laughter, her joy and her wide smile. Mor brought light everywhere, you could never miss her,” said Sapir. Her decision to join the police, “didn’t surprise anyone. It was perfect for her, she was a true fighter.”\nSapir said: “I so much wanted to see her under the chuppa, she was so looking forward to that moment, to build a home of her own and to be a mom, and she never got to.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

The rest of his family managed to escape out the window and was rescued.\nThe IDF revealed in May 2025 that Tom was accidentally slain by IDF soldiers who believed they were firing on Hamas terrorists.\nSoldiers from the Givati Brigade entered the home on October 8 and heard noises coming from the family’s reinforced room. Believing there were terrorists inside the safe room, the soldiers opened fire on the door, which hit Tom, killing him as his wife and daughters escaped, reaching the troops stationed outside who brought them to safety.\nTom is survived by his wife, Limor Havdala, their daughters Romi, 11, Gefen, 6, and Tzuf, 4, as well as his parents, Yaacov and Yael, and his three younger brothers, Assaf, Itamar and Lee. He was buried on October 13 in Kibbutz Na’an.\nThe family had moved to Kissufim only a few months before October 7. Tom was very musical, had begun singing in a local choir, and the family was just starting to acclimate to their new home and surroundings when Hamas attacked.\nHe had an engineering degree from Ben Gurion University and worked in the industry.\nAssaf Godo, his brother, recounted to the Kan public radio that “Tom was only a year and one month older than me. But he was a classic firstborn. Until age 10, I was his shadow, and I did basically everything he did. Sadly, I was never musical like he was,” said Asaf, dedicating the song “Agadat Deshe” (“The Legend of the Grass”), one of his brother’s favorites, in his memory, saying anytime it came on the radio, “He would sing along the entire time.”\nAt Tom’s funeral, his father, Yaacov, noted that “everyone who met and knew Tom couldn’t remain indifferent to his personality and his humanity. Those who did not have the privilege of knowing him, heard today of the man who was.”\nOn Facebook, Limor — who was evacuated to the Dead Sea with their three daughters — has shared snippets of memory and longing in the months since he was killed. “Tom loved to sit next to me, and I loved it,” she wrote. Marking the anniversary of when they met, she wrote: “13 years ago today Tom and I became a couple and my dream of happiness came true. And now what?” In February, she wrote simply: “I miss you so much. I miss us.”\nLimor recounted to Channel 13 news the events of that day, and her guilt over escaping with her daughters out the window without trying to save Tom’s life.\nGefen, 6, told the TV station that her dad would practice soccer with her, and Tzuf, 4, said he would play “airplane… I miss him like crazy.”\n“I wish the door had stronger protection,” added Gefen. “I wish Dad would come back to life.

Naomi and Kobi were slain and Ram was wounded but survived.\nMore than a month later, Ram told Maariv that when the rocket sirens started, they joked around but found a place to shelter. They quickly realized that terrorists were roaming around and shooting people, and hid on the side of the road in fear. After five hours, an army vehicle finally arrived and they thought they had been saved — but the soldiers said it wasn’t safe yet to move them out of the area.\nHalf an hour later, Ram said, “Another terrorist cell arrived and another shoot out began, this time two soldiers [Staff Sgt. Ilay Gamzo and Staff Sgt. Itay-Eliyahu Marchiano] were killed, Kobi and Naomi were murdered, another soldier was wounded and I was wounded… I was covered in blood and the terrorists assumed I was dead.”\nRam said their running group, which also included Lior Waitzman, who was murdered while out biking, “is really a family. When we met at the funerals and headstone settings there were the blood relatives and then the running group ‘family.'”\nNaomi was buried on October 9 in Sderot. She is survived by her husband Yuval and their three children, Ofek, 26, Tal, 23 and Shahar, 19, as well as her nine siblings.\nNaomi was a personal trainer and ran a gym in Netivot, as well as worked at a dentist’s clinic.\nHer sister, Yaffa, wrote in Israel Hayom to “my beloved sister, Naomi. She had a captivating smile that lit up her face, everyone who met her fell in love. She left her mark everywhere she went. She had in her a true and pure love for every person, a unique sensitivity to the weaker elements of society. She was a significant figure in the clinic, the gym, and at home, which was her fortress. We will never forget.”\nHer son, Ofek Shitrit, told Radio Darom, “I could speak for hours about who my mother was and what she meant to me, but what I want people to most remember of her was that she was full of joy for life, smiled at everyone, everyone who lived in Sderot and Netivot — where she worked — knew her… If she could see us now sitting here and crying over her, she would lift us up and start to dance.”\nHer husband, Yuval, told La’Isha magazine that “running was her great love. She only started to work out at age 47, but since — she got completely addicted and exercised with her running group at least three times a week.”\n“Naomi was a wonderful person,” he wrote. “Hardworking, dedicated, a supportive wife, warrior mother, incredible friend, always happy with a captivating smile. Whenever she would enter a room, it would immediately light up.”\nMarking a month since she was killed, her daughter, Tal, wrote on Facebook to “my dear mother, my role model, my whole world. How can I speak about you in the past tense?”\n“You had so many more dreams to achieve, even though you didn’t rest for a second and took advantage of every moment, you still had so many other things in mind,” she wrote. “It wasn’t your time to go — and certainly not this way!”\n“If I didn’t tell you enough, know that I loved you unconditionally!” Tal continued. “Love that hurts in my bones… You were the best mother a child could ask for.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Don’t let him go!'”\nDor was killed when he and his team headed into the final house in Kfar Aza in which terrorists were still holed up and were ambushed.\nHe was buried on October 15 in Kfar Warburg. He is survived by his parents, Yael and David, and his older sisters Rani and Noam.\nHis maternal grandfather, Cpl. Yitzhak Bar-Sade, was killed fighting in the Yom Kippur War in 1973, almost exactly 50 years earlier.\n“It’s a chilling coincidence,” Yael told Channel 12. “It’s the same notification that my mother got 50 years ago, in the same alleyway, the same yard,” she said, noting that the Hebrew dates on which they were killed were just one day apart.\n“He really loved me, this grandson,” his grandmother, Mina Bar-Sade, told Channel 12. “And I loved him.”\nIn a notebook his mother discovered after his death, Sade had written: “I was gifted with an aspiration for excellence. I came to the world to work and not to waste time. I’m going to do something big with my life, this life that I received, and do as much good as possible in the world.”\nHe also wrote, she read on Channel 12, about his reasoning for going into a combat IDF role: “I want to give back to the country in the best way there is, like my grandfather Yitzhak gave, and all of my family after him.”\nNoam shared online the eulogy she read for her brother at his funeral.\n“To me you were a brother, a friend and the person I loved most in the world,” she wrote. “You were the definition of salt of the earth, the most beautiful Israeli, the biggest heart, with an addictive smile and rolling laughter. You were quiet, not loving attention, modest and bashful — the total opposite of me.”\nNoam added that Dor “had the biggest heart that I knew,” noting that when he finished his medic training in the army he stocked his car with a first aid kit, “and you said that if you were driving and saw an accident or someone hurt, you wanted to help them… You were the first to notice others, to volunteer, to do everything possible to help.”\nHis girlfriend, Noa Madar, wrote on Facebook that she wanted to remember Dor first and foremost how he lived, and not just how he died.\n“Dor taught me a lot about life, about love, about relationships,” she wrote, remembering him washing the dishes, opening the car door, his love for popcorn and Bamba filled with nougat. They learned how to argue with each other, she said, and to make up and learn from each other, “because that’s how it is in relationships.”\n“Dor always looked toward the future,” she recalled, noting her plans to travel for several months and his response, “You and I are the real deal, I’m waiting for you here until you return.” They met in the army, she said, recalling “his captivating smile and his kind eyes, and very quickly I had chills.”\n“So Dor, with all your jokes and your jibes… you really, really taught me so much.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was buried on October 11 in Tel Aviv.\nHis loved ones said Niv was planning a big trip abroad in the coming year and then planning to return to study architecture at the Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem. He completed his army service a year before he was killed, during which he served along the northern border. Since his youth he was involved in powerlifting, including winning local competitions, and he was working in a local after-school daycare program.\nThe after-school program, Beit Emanuel, wrote online that “Niv had a unique sensitivity to children. He knew how to communicate with them in an exceptional manner and was beloved by all the children in the daycare, as well as his colleagues. He gave with compassion, professionalism and sensitivity,” they wrote. “A charming young man, outgoing, smiley, ethical, responsible, hardworking and exacting.”\nGal Haviv, who met Niv in high school, described him as “a happy guy and a good friend. I remember the first days we met, when you… would sit quietly in class and not say anything and I as usual tried to start up a conversation with you — and I succeeded, and discovered a boy who loved to work out, who loved to chill and laugh.

He loved people because they loved him and surrounded him everywhere he went.”\nSpeaking to the Kan public broadcaster, Lior described his son’s love for music and his undeniable presence.\n“Niv was a world in himself, he was a unique type, curious, excelling in so many different areas. He never let what other people would think or say to dictate his way of life. He always chose and did what was good for Niv. Music was one of his big loves, it would accompany him all day every day, from the moment he woke up until the late hours of the night. He was a guy of live concerts, he loved the energy, the noise, the crowds, to jump and go crazy,” he continued.\n“Niv’s motto in life was, ‘Be who you are, bring yourself 100% without masks, decorations, love yourself and stay with yourself, nobody will miss you that way’ — that’s exactly Niv.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Her ex-husband, Eli, 93 — who had been captured and held hostage by Egypt on October 7, 1973, and freed after two months — managed to survive the atrocities.\nJust a night earlier, the family said, they had all eaten a festive holiday meal together — Shoshana, Eli, Mayana and Noah. Only Eli survived the next day. For more than 10 days all three were considered missing and thought to potentially be held captive, until their bodies were located and recovered.\nShoshana is survived by her son, Moti, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. She was buried on October 19 in Kibbutz Ein Hashlosha.\nHer granddaughter, Ella Berkovich, who lost her parents and grandmother on the same day, said Shoshana was starting to show signs of dementia and she hoped in some way that she did not really understand what was going on during October 7: “In my thoughts, I am normalizing it that it was fast and she didn’t suffer too much,” Ella told a local news outlet. “I’m keeping it this way to try and keep going and move on. Her loss is not any easier, but it’s more acceptable. These are complicated and confused feelings.”\nOn what would have been her 86th birthday, Ella wrote on Facebook that the family released blue star-shaped balloons with messages written on them into the sky in honor of “our pure angel… we love you, we are pained, we miss you, and we are sure that you will get the stars we sent you with love.”\nHer friend Rivkale Samban Cohen, wrote on Facebook on her birthday, recalling how they had celebrated her 85th a year earlier together at a coffee shop: “Shoshana Karsenty, my good friend, a teacher in my youth, who believed that every girl and boy could paint, and could draw. She was knowledgable in all types of arts, including music, and she particularly loved Leonard Cohen.”\nBorn in Buenos Aires, she moved to Israel alone at age 15 after her mother died and her father, unable to raise the children, sent them to an orphanage, according to a kibbutz eulogy. At 18 she moved to Kibbutz Ein Hashlosha, where she met Eli, a native of Morocco, and they wed and had two children. The couple divorced after a decade, and Shoshana moved to Be’eri only in recent years, to be closer to her daughter.\n“As a child she lived in an orphanage in difficult circumstances, and as an adult she accepted everything with happiness and a smile, never thinking she deserved more,” the kibbutz eulogy reads. “She always said thank you, never complained. She wouldn’t harm a fly, she was modest and humble.”\nShoshana was an artist and longtime art teacher, with a degree in education from Oranim College and art studies at the Avni Institute.\nHer nephew, Udi Cramsky, the head of the interior design department at the Holon Institute of Technology, told the Portfolio art magazine that Shoshana is “remembered as the legendary art teacher in the Eshkol region. She taught generations of students, at first in Kibbutz Ein Shlosha, which she helped found, and later in other nearby kibbutzim and in Be’eri, where she lived in later years with her daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren.”\nUdi said that as a child “I loved to create with her… as an adult, I enjoyed conversations with her. My aunt Shoshana was an incredible intellectual. I admired her. She knew many languages and read in them. She learned and dived deep into many areas, in all their details… she could talk about architecture, philosophy, education, art and many other topics.”\nHer grandson, Tamir Hershkovitz, said he also learned art from her at a young age and later would hold discussions with her about the world of art, although she was not big on sharing her own feelings.\n“Painting was her medium for dialogue between her and the world,” Tamir told Portfolio. “It was an ongoing and endless dialogue throughout the years. After she got divorced and lived alone, her living room became her studio, you could always find there a big canvas or a plyboard with a painting underway.”\nOn October 7, Hamas murdered Shoshana and burned down her house, destroying almost all of her life’s work.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

I’m saying this not because I’m his nephew, he was just a person who thought of other people first and then himself — he endangered himself so that others wouldn’t be in danger.”\nTwo months after Dan was killed, his sister, Efrat Asulin, wrote on Facebook about her longing and grief over her brother.\n“Longing. Only deep and endless longing. To see you again, to smell your smell, to look into your sparkling eyes, to stroke your head, to hug, to kiss, to touch,” she wrote.\n“As time passes, as memories fade, the longing only grows,” Efrat continued. “Longing for your presence, longing for calm, longing for the days before everything, for one moment without longing. My unique, beloved little brother, you will forever be kept in my heart, you are in my thoughts 24/7.”\nIn December, more than two months after he was killed, his son Eliya was born.\n“Dan was really looking forward to the birth,” his wife Hen told Ynet. “When everything happened I was in my seventh month. He wanted a surprise, he didn’t want to know if it was a boy or girl. To our great sadness, he never found out.”\nHen said that Dan intended to be at the birth “just as he was the first time. He wanted a boy because we already have a girl. Giving birth brought me back to the first time when he was by my side… I just hoped that he was with me, even if not physically.”\nShe said that if things in Mivtahim are safe and secure and peaceful, “I’ll go back to the moshav. It’s what Dan would have wanted. He didn’t give up on the moshav, even in battle. He jumped first to defend the community.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Eden Alon Levy, 19, a commander in the Home Front Command, from Nirit, was killed fighting Hamas terrorists at the Zikim training base on October 7.\nLevy was on duty at the base when the Hamas onslaught began, and she and the other commanders told all the young trainees on base to seek shelter, saving their lives. Six of the commanders, including Levy, were killed in the battle, and all but one trainee emerged alive, and the base was ultimately not captured.\nAt 8 a.m., her family said, she sent one last message in their WhatsApp group chat: “I love you guys.”\nShe is survived by her parents, Inbar and Asher, and her four siblings, Roi, Nofar, Shani and Tamir. She was buried on October 8 in Kfar Saba.\nHer loved ones said that aside from her love for the army — where she was exploring the possibility of pilot’s training — Eden loved to dance, and did so for a decade, including performances with a local dance troupe.\nHer sister, Shani, told Channel 12 news that “Eden’s story proves without a doubt how much female combat soldiers can also do, and even more so [than men]. I am simply proud of her, and I hope that I can be brave like her,” added Shani, who is also currently serving in the IDF. “She’s simply a hero, a hero to everyone.”\n“I miss her coming to annoy me, even when I had no strength, even when I would come home drained from the army,” Shani added. “I’d go straight to bed, fall on my face, and she’d always come and shout at me, ‘Shniki, what’s going on?’ I miss her bothering me. Please come back and annoy me.”\nHer mother, Inbar — herself a police officer — told Ynet that “we can’t say we were surprised” by her heroic actions on October 7. “This is the home she grew up in. Eden had a lot of internal strength, a lot of determination. When she decided to do something, she saw it all the way through. It wasn’t surprising at all.”\nHer sister, Nofar, who was also a combat soldier, added: “We were all raised like this, but none of us thought it would really come to this and she would really go way above and beyond expectations.”\nNofar told the Kan public broadcaster that Eden “really loved to dance, she was in a troupe of the south Sharon region, she was there for years, she was really good at it, full of energy.”\nShe noted that the family has found “some sort of comfort that she died as a hero, that she fought, she did what she believed in until the last moment, and she saved the lives of 100 soldiers which is crazy.”\nIf she could say one more thing to her, Nofar said: “I would say that I love her and that I’m so proud of her, and that she should take care of herself — even though it wouldn’t help. But mostly that I’m proud of her.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Tova Goren, 65, and her daughter Aran Goren, 33, were murdered by Hamas terrorists in their home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7.\nThey are survived by Aran’s siblings and Tova’s children, Noa and Ido — as well as three nieces and nephews/grandchildren — plus Tova’s siblings, Aviram and Osnat. They were predeceased in 2019 by Eyal, Tova’s husband and Aran’s father, following a long illness.\nAran and Tova were buried side by side in Kibbutz Shefayim on October 22.\nTova was a longtime teacher who had retired just weeks before her death, but still ran her own catering business. She and Eyal originally settled in the Dugit settlement in northern Gaza, and moved to Kibbutz Nahal Oz following the 2005 disengagement. Following the move, they started a catering business in place of the restaurant they had ran in Dugit, which Tova continued after his death — which is also when she moved to Kfar Aza. Aran had come to visit her mother especially to help her out with a catering gig that weekend.\nAran, who was living in Givatayim, was a prolific social activist who worked for the past two years for the nonprofit Comeback, which worked to rehabilitate ex-prisoners. She had a bachelor’s degree in communications from Sapir College in Sderot, before making a career switch and getting a master’s degree at Hebrew University in Jerusalem’s “Glocal” program in international development, which included five months working in Nepal with underprivileged communities.\nIdo Goren wrote on Facebook to his sister a week after she was killed: “Arani, we went from loving siblings to enemies to friends and back to siblings. We are so alike that it caused conflict, we were and remain two stubborn people.”\n“We always challenged each other, and most of the time we were an inseparable force. You were the backbone everywhere you went, with your friends, in the army, in every workplace, studies and all your trips. It was known that Aran Goren lives the life, does what she wants, and succeeds, knows how to achieve. You were like the flow of water which erodes a rock with steadfast force, never giving up and never compromising.”\nIdo continued: “I will try to be closer to who you thought I should be, to what you knew I could do. I love you forever. I’m prepared to say that we are similar, ready to admit that I was wrong. But unlike the other things I may have denied, this I am ready to say again and again — I love you.”\nWriting to his mother, Tova, Ido said that she always felt “like an anchor to the world when I was sinking into my anxieties. We were connected in a way that people didn’t understand… You were always there to give me strength when I fell.” He described her as a “career woman, who carried an entire family on her back. Who worked around the clock. Who didn’t sleep at night until the last moment, because taking care of her family was so important to her.\n“She was always giving, always listening, always half angry but completely understanding,” he added. “You were our pride and an inspiration to thousands. I was so happy for you when you retired, I so much wanted you to start to enjoy and to let go of the burden… I have so much to say about you because I can no longer speak to you, my best friend, who I could never keep anything from.”\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Aran Goren (@aranush)\nNoa shared online the eulogy she read at the joint funeral of her mother and sister.\n“You were both so beautiful. All that was truly good in the world. Endless generosity. Nonstop activity. Dedication to the needs of others. A true desire for justice. Wisdom expressed in razor-sharp words. Heaps of humor, the darkest of humor — how dark it is now,” said Noa.\n“Your light is so missing. An insane reality in which I don’t have a father, I don’t have a mother and I don’t have a sister,” she continued. “And I am so alone and so together at the same time. Together in pain with all the people whose lives you were in, who were privileged to absorb your light.”\nAran, she said, was a “girl of freedom with big eyes, a girl who fell asleep everywhere because the whole world was her home, a social justice warrior and a defender of the weak, a pusher of boundaries, my keeper of secrets, my partner in life, the most hysterically funny person I know, but also the calmest… You are magic, you are light, you are love and you are freedom. You are smart and strong and brave with no ability to plan financially,” she joked. “In my heart, there is a hole in the shape of you.”\nTurning to her mother, Noa noted, “How very much I need my mother right now. It’s so hard to find the words to say about you. You knew almost everything about me. You were mostly the first person I called when I needed help, support, calming down, proportionality or just to say out loud what I was thinking.”\n“You kept working as if we were all still living in the house and you were providing for 10 people and at the same time you kept friendships and leisure and plenty of time for your grandchildren,” she said. “Our hearts are bound together in a bond that can’t be untied.”\nParting from both of them, Noa added: “The loves of my life, the smart, the beautiful. The good in you will light our way.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Guy Simhi, 20, an off-duty soldier in the Paratroopers Brigade from Gedera, was killed on October 7 while trying to fend off Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Re’im.\nSimhi was on break that weekend and attending the Supernova music festival when the onslaught began. He and other friends fled to nearby Re’im, where one of them lived, and entered the apartment’s safe room. But Guy and his friend, who was an armed off-duty soldier, stayed outside standing guard, and managed to kill two terrorists who entered the apartment, survivors later recounted.\nBut the terrorists threw grenades inside, wounding them, and when Guy, who was unarmed, jumped out a window, he was killed, while his friend and all the others in their group managed to survive.\nGuy was the son of Dedy Simhi, a former commissioner of Israel’s Fire and Rescue Services, who also had a long military career, reaching the rank of brigadier-general, and is a frequent panel guest on Israel’s news broadcasts.\nDedy was the one who ultimately recovered the body of his own son at 2 a.m. that night after it lay on the ground for hours next to the apartment.\n“I told the [soldier] stationed at the entrance [to Re’im] that my son was lying there dead,” Dedy told Ynet less than 24 hours later. “They recovered him, I embraced him and accompanied him until Ramle, where the bodies of those killed were gathering. He was an incredible boy. He and his childhood friend killed two terrorists and saved the lives of 14 friends. They’ve been coming to our house and telling them that Guy saved their lives.”\nGuy — who was born in Re’im and moved to Gedera as a child — was buried on October 10 in Gedera. He is survived by his parents, Orit and Dedy, and his two brothers, Tomer and Alon.\nHis mother, Orit, told the Mako news site that “everyone whose children die say that they were perfect, but Guy was really like no other.”\n“He was a surfer, a fighter, so many people loved him,” she added. “He was the glue of all his friend groups. He was incredibly handsome and knew it. They took the light from my eyes, nobody can bring it back.”\nHis brother, Alon, recorded a memorial video for Channel 13, reading to “my Guygo, my little brother, the good looking and cocky one. I don’t have the words to describe how much I will miss you.\n“For years you have been my best friend and the best partner I could ask for,” he said. “Despite the five-year age gap, Guy and I were very close. From a young age I was your role model — we would watch the same TV shows, play the same games and enjoy the same vices. All this until you grew up, and you became my role model.”\nAlon said they would always stick together at family gatherings “and gossip about the family. On Saturdays I would take you with me to play volleyball and of course there too you would steal the show. You made sure to be the best in every area that interested you. We were together so much that I would tell my parents that I raised you, and you were like my son.”\nHe continued: “Three months ago we buried you, and my whole world collapsed. I stood at your funeral and I couldn’t hold myself together. The whole time I felt your hand on my back — I know it wasn’t you, but I felt that it was… I hope you can hear me from there, I promise to be strong and to reach the expectations you had of me. It’s weird to think that I was once the role model of an angel.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Manzuri worked as a waitress while Cohen worked for the RE/MAX real estate company.\nAmit’s mother Orly Cohen told Channel 13 that he was planning to propose marriage to Manzuri on her birthday, February 5.\n“He was a person who was always smiling,” Orly said. “He was always surrounded by friends.”\nCohen and Manzuri loved to dance and were excited to attend the Supernova festival as a last hurrah before the country returned to its normal work schedule after the Jewish holidays, according to Channel 13.\nAmit Cohen, who was killed on October 7 at the Supernova desert rave (Courtesy).\nShay Shemesh, a close friend of Cohen and Manzuri who survived the Supernova massacre, explained in a series of social media posts that while she went to the festival in a private car, her friends had organized a bus to take them in a large group. This unfortunately meant that Amit and Norelle did not have an easily accessible vehicle when it came time to leave on Saturday morning.\nAfter spending Friday night dancing and enjoying themselves, the pair woke on Saturday to rocket sirens and eventually hid, along with Norelle’s sister Roya and dozens of other terrified partygoers, inside a roadside bomb shelter near the site of the festival.\nIt was there that Amit, his girlfriend Norelle and her sister Roya were all slain when Hamas terrorists fired inside and threw grenades into the structure. Of the 40 people tightly packed into the shelter that day, 24 were killed according to Channel 13.\n“I am proud of my son,” Orly Cohen told Channel 13. “He stood there, he took care of the girls, he didn’t leave them alone.

He was buried in Kibbutz Ein Gev on October 18.\nHis friend Ariel Gabay told the Davar newspaper that Kazir got up early to feed his fleet of carrier pigeons, “and then set out on a jeep trip. He apparently heard the sirens and tried to return home. The terrorists murdered him.”\nHis family noted that he fought in the Yom Kippur War, was a devoted family man, dedicated kibbutznik and farmer and was best known in his retirement for raising his collection of carrier pigeons — with images of his beloved birds even engraved onto his headstone.\nHis brother, Moshe, spoke at the ceremony marking 30 days since he was killed: “My beloved brother David. I thought that you would always be with us, that I could always tell you that I love you and that I’m proud that you’re my brother. I was wrong! When you were killed I understood how dear you were to me, what a unique and wonderful person you were, a lover of others, with a huge heart.”\nIn a memorial video for Channel 13, his wife, Ayelet Benedek Kazir, noted that while everyone called him “Katchko,” she always called him “Mami Dov.”\n“My Mami Dov. I am empty. Things are bad for me,” she said. “Why am I speaking to a coffin or to a mound of dirt. I need your quiet, your calming hands, your kind eyes. The quiet. The quiet.”\nAyelet said that “at least you left me with the knowledge that your life’s work, our family, was complete. In literary terms it’s called ‘the extended family’ — you were the uniting center, and we gathered around you with great love. We are all tied together to each other — the kids, grandkids and me.

You taught us, you and mom, that family and siblings is the most important thing, and it’s a way of life for all of us. Our connection is magical and loving, and much of that is due to you.”\nShe said that as a couple, her parents have “shown us what love is, what is sensitivity and caring, what is patience and tolerance, and most importantly the importance of two or three breaths before you blow up. My Abush, I always wanted to be like you — kind, modest, steadfast. You’re not a man of words, you’re a man of actions, and in everything you do, there is a huge heart that moves me… you are truly a source of inspiration.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Shilo Har-Even, 25, a company commander in the Golani Brigade from Almon, was killed battling Hamas terrorists at the Nahal Oz IDF base on October 7.\nHe was buried on October 13 on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. He is survived by his parents, Ingrid and Benny, his brothers Nevo and Eitam, and his girlfriend Tamar.\n“That Saturday morning, immediately when they identified the invasion of the Nahal Oz base, [Shilo] charged at the terrorists,” his father, Benny, told the Israel Hayom newspaper. “He jumped into an armored personnel carrier with six of his guys and they started to travel along the border. Shilo stood outside the APC and waged a stubborn battle, he shot the terrorists and ran them over. He and his team killed dozens of terrorists. They traveled along the border, repelling and eliminating terrorists.”\nBenny said Shilo was wounded in his hand during the gun battles, but didn’t stop, instead “he bandaged himself up, and when he heard the Nahal Oz outpost was being attacked he left the fence and headed over there.” The APC came under intense fire, and after being hit by an RPG was no longer usable, said Benny, so Shilo headed out on foot to fight and was killed in battle.\nSpeaking to Channel 13 news, his mother, Ingrid, described him as “a person who gave so much to this world which he loved so much.” During the shiva, she said, “Generations of soldiers he raised came to us, there wasn’t one who didn’t say, ‘Shilo helped me so much, he made me a better person.’ And in the moment of truth, they followed him, because they believed in him and relied on him.”\n“He didn’t flee, he didn’t quit after he was wounded, he kept going, kept going until the end,” she added. “I wouldn’t exchange the 25 years I had with him with a boy who lived to be 90… We are crying over not just what was but also what will not be.”\nShilo’s girlfriend, Tamar Avrouskine, recounted to Maariv that they started dating more than a year before he was killed “and it was immediately clear to us that this was it. We moved in together very quickly.”\n“Shilo’s a Zionist and ethical person, we had so many conversations about the army, about commanding — he met with so many people to sharpen his approach to commanding, to be a better commander, to give his soldiers a better service experience. He was an incredible commander. He was also very family-oriented, connected to his roots, country, and tradition.”\nAvrouskine said she last saw him on Thursday afternoon, just before he died, when she went to visit him near Nahal Oz.\n“We sat together for an hour in a grove near the outpost,” she recounted. “We parted and said we’d meet on Shabbat because usually, I would bring him food… I was always afraid that something would happen to Shilo. Because of his nature, I knew that if something happened he would be the first to charge ahead.”\nAvrouskine said they were planning to get engaged last year and married this year — “we built our future together,” she said, noting that he had set a clear path for himself as well: “Shilo didn’t want an army career, he wanted to finish two more years in the army, be released, study law, enter politics. First, as the head of a pre-army academy, to enter the Education Ministry and eventually to be prime minister.”\n“He sincerely believed that he could change the face of the country, to bring it to a better place,” she said. “He had a vision. He wanted things to be good here… This is our country, there’s no place else we can live. Shilo would want us to act so things will be better here.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She was buried in Ofakim on October 12.\nThe family moved to Israel in 1990 from the Caucasus, and Berta worked as a quality control manager at the Sodastream factory in Lehavim.\nElad Barades, an HR manager for Sodastream, paid tribute to Berta in a Facebook post, noting that they met close to a decade ago when the company opened its new southern headquarters.\n“I will never forget her smile, the light in her eyes, the optimism, the wide heart — such a unique woman,” wrote Barades. “Berta was always at the heart of the team and the work, volunteering for whatever was needed, even in difficult times, during wars and COVID, always with a smile.”\n“Berta always helped everyone, with a smile, cordiality and her characteristic pleasantness,” he added. “She was always surrounded by friends, of all ages and all backgrounds and sectors… Everyone who knew Berta would tell you that she was the mom of the department and the factory.”\nHer son, Sason, told At Magazine that he spoke with her that morning amid the rocket fire when she said the bus had a flat tire. “I told her I was coming to get her immediately, but she said she didn’t want to leave the group.”\nSason said he set out towards her anyway, but was blocked from leaving Netivot by police.\n“My mother, who was an active woman, worked 12-hour shifts and had many plans for life,” he said. “She traveled a lot to the Dead Sea, she took advantage of every opportunity to be there, that was her love, and in one fell swoop everything ended.”\nHer daughter, Aviva told a local radio station that her mother was very much looking forward to the trip to the Dead Sea that day when she and every other passenger were gunned down.\n“They had no way of defending themselves. They had nowhere to run,” Aviva said tearfully, noting that they searched for her for days afterward until they were informed that her body had been identified and her death confirmed.\n“She was such a good woman, she was a woman with dreams, it was such a year of development for her,” Aviva said. “She was finally starting to live for herself. She was so hardworking, dedicated to her job. She gave her children so much love.”\nHer daughter, Sigal Cohen, gave birth to her fifth child several months after the loss of her mother.\n“I knew the whole time that the pregnancy would come to an end but the grief would continue to be part of me,” Sigal said in a post shared by the hospital where she gave birth. “It might sound like a cliche, but my mother was my best friend. We’re not that far apart in age and she accompanied me and gave me strength in every stage of my life, and was very significant in every birth.”\nSigal added, “This time I knew that her loss would be too difficult to bear for me, and I was very worried. It was so hard to stop the tears and her absence was strongly felt.” But, she noted, a midwife showed up at one point speaking Russian, her mother tongue, “and it was a unique moment where I felt that my mother was reminding me that despite everything, despite the darkness, she was with me and it would be OK.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Adir Eshto Bogale, 20, a Golani soldier, from Ariel, was killed on October 7 battling Hamas terrorists at the Nahal Oz IDF outpost.\nHe is survived by his parents, Ortal and Getnet Gideon, and his brother Shaked and sister Shoval. He was buried on October 12 in Petah Tikva.\nHis parents appeared on Channel 14 to discuss their son’s legacy and his actions on that fateful day.\nGideon said Adir was scheduled to be on guard duty from 4 to 7 a.m. Saturday morning at the base right next to the border. He was part of the first line when the terrorists stormed the base and managed to kill dozens of terrorists alongside his comrades before he ran out of ammunition and was shot dead.\nAdir, Gideon said, always dreamed of serving in the Golani Brigade, “and fought to be in Golani… he was so connected to the country, he loved people so much.” He said since his death, “There are things we’ve been learning about him. His generosity, his spirit of volunteerism — we thought he was just out playing with his friends, but he wasn’t.”\nHe was a “very stubborn child, if he set a goal for himself, he would do everything to achieve it,” said Gideon.\n“Adir was a person who loved everyone, embraced everyone… He was a man of faith,” said Gideon, noting that he would study Torah every Shabbat and that he attended a secular school and was “the only one who would wear a kippa and tzitzit. And when they would go on a trip he would say to them, ‘Come put on tefillin.’ Also in the army, that’s what he would do.”\nHis mother, Ortal, described him to the network as “a smiley child, very social, a bit of a clown. He had a big impact on those around him.”\nOn an Instagram memorial page set up for Adir, his girlfriend, Alem, recalled meeting him on her birthday, “and ever since then I felt and said that you were my gift.”\n“I knew how pure and righteous you were, but the pride I had when I heard stories and memories from people who knew you made me realize that you really were one in a million, and on the other hand made me sad that I didn’t manage to get to know you all the way,” Alem wrote.\nShe said that since he was killed, “I speak to you all the time, and just hope that you are listening, sometimes it helps and sometimes it makes me more depressed… you were always there for me and by my side, listening, accepting, helping and supporting me. Thank you for showing me that there is hope for this generation, that there are still people like you out there. I love you, I miss you, and I am waiting and know that we will meet again.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

That was the last anyone heard from them.\nFour days later, Sapir’s family was informed that her body had been found. She was buried on October 11 in Rishon Lezion. She is survived by her parents, Leon and Inna, and her brother Daniel.\nSapir had returned only a few months earlier from a big trip around South America — where she first met Karin. She was working in a bank, her friends said, was a huge fan of Maccabi Tel Aviv and was living her life to the fullest on nights and weekends, with an upcoming vacation abroad already planned.\nHer friend Eden Akri told the Kan public broadcaster that Sapir was “the best friend I could ever ask for.”\n“Sapir and I were very close, we could sit in the same room together just her and I and speak for hours, play Sony together, she would call me coach and anytime she would tell me that she beat someone we would be on cloud nine like we won a championship,” he recounted.\nIn the month since she died, he said, “I discovered how many people she was surrounded by, all almost as incredible as her, everyone caring, worrying, trying to strengthen each other, which only strengthens the understanding of how incredible she was. Her caring, her love, her desire to do good for those around her were so strong that it caused people around her to be like her.”\nSapir’s friends Emily Yerman and Tanya Mogilevsky penned a tribute to her on the Maccabi TLV site: “Our Sapir was a light in the life of so many people who surrounded her and she spread so much enjoyment, happiness and life.”\nThey said that “Sapir was a girl who just wanted to celebrate life as a 24-year-old deserves to. A girl with endless dreams and aspirations, who loved to go see Maccabi and made sure to never miss a game!”\nHer friend Shahar Orenstein spoke to the Frogi news site about their friendship and her loved ones’ efforts to fundraise for an ambulance in Sapir’s name. The pair met, she said, during COVID when they got jobs at a healthcare provider hotline after they were laid off from the restaurant business.\nSapir, said Shahar, “was an incredibly funny person, would make you die of laughter. She was happy all the time, optimistic even in tough situations. She would find a way to look at everything in a positive and humorous way.”\n“Sapir’s story is largely tragic, but none of us want to remember Sapir as a tragic figure, but a figure of light and love,” Shahar added. “She accompanies us every day, with memories and signs that she sends… I am thankful for every day that Sapir was a part of my life.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She told the Kan public broadcaster that the pair entered with shrapnel wounds after a rocket hit their car.\nNot long after, she said, they heard automatic gunfire outside, and they quickly understood that “the terrorists were going from shelter to shelter and shooting the people inside them.” When the terrorists entered their shelter, she said, “Sefi and Gal charged at them with bare hands and pushed them out of the shelter… and we heard the automatic gunfire and the shouts stopped, and we understood they were no longer alive.”\nGal is survived by his parents, Naama and Nir, and his sister Maya. He was buried on October 11 in Petah Tikva.\nHe served for more than five years in various positions in the Computer Service Directorate, including the development and maintenance of IDF logistics systems. Gal earned a computer science degree from the College of Management in Rishon Lezion and was working as a programmer at the Melio payment platform at the time of his death.\nHis boss at Melio, Or Frenkel, wrote on Facebook that Gal was “not only a colleague but also a true friend to everyone. He was a beacon of happiness and positivity, and his intelligence was exceptional… he had a talent for bringing out the best in everyone.”\nHis friend Gal Waitzman wrote online that “Navon always knew how to give everyone he was sitting with his full attention, and even more than that. When you speak to him there’s a feeling that he’s really interested in you, in every word and detail. When he tells a story he makes eye contact and makes you feel like you were really in the situation.\n“He was the most sociable person there was, witty and chill (a deadly and super funny combination), smart and modest,” added Waitzman. “He always made sure that nothing interesting would happen when he wasn’t around — a man with FOMO. He always had a smile on his face, he was always optimistic and positive.”\n“Gal and Sefi were both people who lived life,” Gal’s mother, Naama, told Kan. “They really took life by storm. It’s almost as if they knew it would end early.”\nMarking 30 days since he was killed, Naama wrote on Facebook a tribute to “Gal, my life, my boy, my love.”\n“How can I speak of you when it all sounds empty in the face of the light that you were in life,” she wrote. “So smart, so successful, so sensitive to everyone. Everyone who met you fell in love with you in seconds, there was so much joy for life in you it’s like you were life itself. All of your actions were inspiring.”\n“You may no longer be here, but you are found between the beats of my heart,” she added. “I love you my Gal, my son, I thank you for the wonderful years you were here with us and made us happy and proud.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

According to reports, they sought safety with others in a roadside bombshelter near Kibbutz Be’eri at one point, but Dan decided to leave the structure, saying it didn’t feel safe.\nIn his last phone call to his family sometime after 12:30, “He said, ‘They’re killing me, mom they’re killing me,'” his mother later recounted.\nAfter four days of searching, his body was found.

In his memory, his friends raised funds to be able to publicly release a song he wrote and recorded before his death.\n“From his childhood, he lived in the world of music, he was a talented artist, composer, musician and singer,” his friend Shir Edry wrote on the fundraising page. “Before his death, Dan managed to record an original song that he wrote, composed and sang.

Although her shift had been slated to finish at 6 a.m., she ended up staying. “With her calm, she saved the lives of many partygoers,” Police Commander Amir Klein told Ynet. “She was the first one to alert me from the party about the terrorists who were shooting and the killings, thanks to her we understood there was a massacre going on in Re’im.”\nKlein said that Vakser’s “request that we send backup, while under gunfire, led me to connect to the army and to send forces there,” noting that she sent photos of those who had been killed and wounded, and “through her, I understood how pressing it was to send forces to Rei’m to save the young people who were still alive who had nowhere to hide.”\nHe said that at around 9 a.m., she sent him a message saying “pray for me,” and within half an hour she was no longer answering. Her phone was later geolocated to Gaza.\n“Yulia was a wonderful woman, simply a warrior — in life and in death,” said Klein. “On her day off she went to earn money and secure the partygoers at the festival. She took care of her parents, her family. She took on the yoke of providing for her family so that they would lack nothing.”\nIt took more than a week for her body to be found and identified, during which her family thought she may have been kidnapped. Her body was identified in part via tattoos she had of her children’s names.\nYulia is survived by her husband, Samuel Daunov, and their two children, Shirel, 12, and Liron, 8, as well as her parents, Alexander and Yelena, and a sister, Victoria. She was buried on October 18 in Beersheba.\nBorn in Ukraine, she moved to Israel in 1996 as a child with her family. She joined the police as part of her mandatory service in 2005, and stayed on for close to 20 years until she was killed.\nHer relative, Svetlana, posted on Instagram: “Yulechka, our dear girl. Sweet, kind, funny and so bright… warm like the sun… The world went dark without your smile… our angel, rest in peace.”\nHer husband, Samuel, told the Kan public broadcaster that Yulia didn’t think twice about staying at the festival to help after her shift ended: “She decided to stay. Of course, she didn’t think otherwise. She’s a hero, she was always a woman like that. Even though she’s not a field officer, she was usually in the station.”\nSamuel said that at 9:14 a.m., she sent him one final message: “‘Take care of the kids, I love all of you,’ she wrote. And that’s it. Those are the last words I heard from her,” he said.\n“She was the light of the house, our pillar of strength,” he added. “A very dominant mother at home, at a level that’s hard to describe.

Everyone admired you… Yesterday, your teammates came to visit you in the hospital and say goodbye to you. Each of them talked about your physical strength. They all said that you were the strongest on the team,” said his mother, Varda Morell, at the funeral.\nMorell was born in the West Bank settlement of Talmon to Varda and Eitan, along with four other siblings, including well-known hilltop youth turned left-wing activist Dov Morell, who eulogized his brother online.\n“Those who knew our family, but not Maoz, would probably be surprised to hear that we have a brother in the [Paratroopers] Patrol. We’re a family of nerds,” wrote his older brother. “You couldn’t catch me playing soccer without a PE teacher holding a gun to my head. But not Maoz.”\nOn the morning of October 7, Morell was on holiday. Upon hearing of Hamas’s brutal attack on Israel’s south, he went home to collect his equipment and rushed to the fighting underway in the Re’im area. That day marked the last time his family saw him until he was hospitalized, remaining mostly unconscious until his death.\nThe elder Morell sibling described his brother as a “writer and a warrior” who, even after enlisting in the army, “did not for a moment abandon Torah study.”\n“Before the first entry into Gaza, families were given the chance to send things to soldiers. Maoz requested only a watch, camera, two copies of the Tanakh and a translation, so he wouldn’t miss out on his regular studies,” continued Dov Morell. “Every time he came home you would see him with a book in his hand, except when he collapsed from fatigue, of course.”\nMorell’s parents recalled their son as a “source of strength” for their family during a rough patch.\n“You were born during a difficult time in our family, we gave you the name Maoz [strength] so that you would be a source of strength for us, and what strength you have,” continued Morell’s mother at Har Herzl.\n“Maoz, now that you have fallen, where will we get the strength we drew from you?” his father Eitan said.\nYisrael Gantz, the head of the Binyamin Regional Council, eulogized Morell in a statement: “For a whole week Maoz lay between heaven and Earth, gradually separated from this world and from the country which he loved and fought for. His amazing family wrapped him in love until his soul returned to the Creator. We cry and mourn for a lovely young man, from a young and beautiful generation of Binyamin who leads with values, in character and on the battlefield.”\nThe same incident which fatally wounded Morell also killed another soldier, Staff Sgt.

Shirel’s boyfriend, Aviel Oren, was also murdered at the rave. Ortal was buried in Jerusalem on October 15.\nShe is survived by her parents, Michael and Rivka Julia, and her three siblings.\nOrtal and her sister posted Instagram stories from the festival of them dancing and celebrating just hours before the Hamas onslaught began.\nOrtal worked as a waitress at the Hamotzi restaurant in Jerusalem. Its chef, Avi Levy, told Ynet that her loss was “simply heartbreaking.”\nLevy said he last saw her on Thursday evening, during a busy shift at the restaurant just hours before she was slain: “This is a huge loss for us. We called Ortal tzutzikit because she was little, fast, efficient and was in every place. Ortal was patient and very responsible.”\nShe was a graduate of the Nirim Youth Village for at-risk youth, which described her in a statement as “having a big soul and a wide heart, full of joy for life in the face of all the difficulties and circumstances. She had a captivating personality, a sense of humor and a spiciness, which won over many people.”\nHer close friend, Avishag Fahima, described her on Instagram as “a ray of light, a pillar of strength to us and to so many people who love you so much.”\n“You know that I can’t stop remembering our experiences together in life,” she continued. “You were a friend but [it was] not a regular friendship, a sister, a soulmate… since I was 13 until today, a friendship where we lived together, dreamed together, laughed together… and now? Now I am left with memories, photos, and WhatsApp recordings which I play all the time because I just miss hearing you.”\nHer sister Shirel, who lost both Ortal and her own boyfriend during the massacre, wrote on Instagram on November 7: “A month ago the life that I knew ended.”\n“Ortal fought cancer and she defeated it — she just wanted to live and to make her dreams come true and to travel around the world and to have a family,” wrote Shirel. “Ortal was a free butterfly, nothing stopped her from living, she knew how to get up from every fall and to emerge stronger — she was so strong and opinionated, she was a good person to everyone.”\nShirel wrote that they went together to the party with their boyfriends, “we enjoyed, we danced, we laughed, we never imagined that’s how our lives would end, never believed that the dreams we wanted to come true would stand still forever. My sister was the soul you would want to meet on a bad day, she was everything — and not just because she was my sister, because of her good heart, her desire to lift the spirits of every person she met.”\n“I miss you more each day than the day before, I love you every day more than yesterday,” she continued. “We were everything to each other, we went through a lot of pain that only you and I understand, and now it’s just me left here to understand and to hold onto the pain.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was buried on October 9 in Sderot.\nHe is survived by his wife, Limor, and their son Kfir, 4, as well as his parents, Tamar and Baruch, and his four older siblings, Ronen, Emmy, Daniela and Irit.\nWaitzman, a sound technician, had a bachelor’s degree in sound and film arts from Sapir College in Sderot, and had worked on shows including “Fauda,” “Tehran,” “Unorthodox” and “The Beauty Queen of Jerusalem,” among many others.\nHe had also been working on “Bros,” the Hebrew-language comedy which had been slated to hit Netflix in November and was delayed due to the war.\nTed Sarandos, the CEO of Netflix, paid tribute to Waitzman during a Bloomberg event a few days after he was killed: “One of the victims of this terror attack, Lior Waitzman, was working on our first Netflix original series there, called ‘Bros’… our hearts go out to Lior and his family,” Sarandos said.\nOn October 7, Waitzman was out biking to train for a half Ironman contest he was planning on competing in just a few weeks later.\n“Tehran” co-creator Daniel Syrkin told Deadline that “Lior was just 32 years old, and a really sweet guy… It was a normal day and he went out on his bike smiling. He was a beautiful person.”\nAt the unveiling of his headstone a month after his death, his 4-year-old son, Kfir, climbed on top of his grave so he could hug and kiss his father one more time. The photos of Kfir’s grief went viral in Israel as the nation continued to grieve its losses.\nLior’s sister, Daniela Peretz, described him on Instagram as “the salt of the earth, talented and modest. You died as you lived — determined, brave and doing the thing you loved most — sports. And you loved, you loved the way that people don’t even know how to love anymore.”\n“Alongside all of the friends and the family who came to honor you today [at his headstone unveiling], I will shout in a loud voice how much you are missed by everyone, forever,” she wrote. “Everyone here misses you.”\nLior’s wife, Limor Waitzman, told Channel 12 that they met more than a decade ago and got married in 2015: “Already during his degree at Sapir College he started working in the industry, he was a meteor in everything he did. Over the past three years, he was training for long-distance running and took part in half-marathons and marathons, when he finished he decided he wanted a change and started [training for] triathlons.”\nOn October 7, when the rockets started firing, Limor texted Lior to stay safe and find somewhere to hide out. He sent her one final selfie of him lying on the ground with his head on his hands next to his bike, “with a sort of half smile,” she said. After he called and said he had been shot, she went out to try and find him and was shot at by terrorists and ended up turning back.\nAfter they received news that he had been killed, Limor said their little family is shattered: “The connection between [Lior and Kfir] was incredible, so much laughter and games, he was just teaching him how to ride a bike and we signed him up for a swimming lesson because he wanted to be just like Dad.”\n“Kfir asks a lot of questions,” she added. “I explained to him that bad people killed Dad and he really wanted to come back to Kfir but he couldn’t, and now it’s just Mom and Kfir.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

An hour later, the connection was cut off, and they never heard from her again.\nShe is survived by her four children, Chen, Tzlil, Nitzan and Niv, and 12 grandchildren, as well as at least one brother. She was predeceased by her husband, Akiva. Nira was buried in Kibbutz Eyal on October 22.\nAccording to Walla, Nira was born in Kibbutz Afikim and settled in Kfar Aza after her army service and was among its early founders. It was there that she met Akiva Ronen, who became her husband, and they wed on the kibbutz; he died three years ago.\nGil Moalem described Nira as “a mother, grandmother, friend and wonderful neighbor to the members of Kibbutz Kfar Aza.”\nIn a video posted online in February and filmed not long before the massacre, Nira — and other members of the kibbutz, including Bilha Epstein, who was also murdered on October 7 — discuss the early years of building Kfar Aza in the 1950s.\n“I arrived in Kfar Aza, and my impression when I got there was like I had arrived in a paradise that had nothing,” Nira said in the film. She said she spent a few months there before enlisting and met Akiva, “and the whole time I was in the army, Akiva would come and visit me — wherever I would go, he was there.” After the army, she decided not to return to Afikim and settled instead in Kfar Aza.\n“The place, it had a certain kind of magic,” she said. “It wasn’t beautiful in the time that we arrived, there wasn’t much grass, much anything. But it had a joy of young people who came to do something, that was really important to them. And it was in their hands, they did it.”\nAt her funeral, her grandson recalled their final conversation as the home she loved was turning into a hellscape.\n“Savta, I spoke to you for the last time at 8 a.m. on that terrible Saturday,” her grandson, Omri Ronen, read at her graveside funeral. “You said you were in the safe room with Angie and you were afraid. That there was shooting outside, and knocking on the door. I told you not to worry.”\n“My grandmother was honest to a fault,” Omri told Channel 12 news. “She lived a full life, she was smiling, cheerful.”\nOmri said that when he finally returned to his grandparents’ home in Kfar Aza, he found a note written in Arabic by one of her killers in her day planner, that read: “You will die here. You won’t stay here.”\n“My grandfather and grandmother founded the kibbutz, and this place is theirs and ours,” Omri later wrote online. “We’ll build our home and families here nonetheless, and continue to build a strong, prosperous and developed country.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was shot dead by a terrorist who had been hiding out inside the barn.\nHe is survived by his wife, Dorit, and their three daughters, Adi, Netta and Yuval, as well as his parents, Yossi and Gaby. He was buried in Ashkelon on October 18.\nKissufim’s chairman, Gavri Bar-Gil, told Walla that the kibbutz was sealed off as a closed military zone amid the attack but Heinik “asked to go to the barn to feed the cows and give them water and try to milk them,” and received approval from the IDF. “Reuven showed devotion to his mission and fulfilled the most basic principles of Zionism and agriculture. He said he couldn’t leave the cows without food and water.”\nHeinik “was a central figure in Kissufim. A beloved man, smiling and optimistic, a first-rate professional who was well known in the dairy industry in Israel,” added Bar-Gil.\nA eulogy from the Israeli Cattle Breeders’ Association noted that before starting work in Kissufim around 15 years ago, Heinik managed the teaching dairy farm at Kfar Silver and educated generations of future dairy farmers.\n“Everyone who spoke about him mentioned immediately his big smile, his good heart and his great love for dairy farming,” the eulogy noted.\nHis childhood friend, Avi Am Shalem, noted that they played soccer together in their youth, and remained close for decades, flying together every year since 1997 for a ski vacation: “Reuven was a true friend, a smiling guy, a real person, who loved bike trips, jeep tours, he was my best friend, we met every day.”\nBeing a dairy farmer, Am Shalem noted, “was his life’s work, he really loved the work, the cowshed and of course the kibbutz.”\nHis sister, Chani, told a local Ashkelon memorial site that “Reuven was a man of love! From his love for music, singing and playing, to his love for his family and his dedication to his loved ones and friends. He was a man of nature, trips and adventures, he loved the land of Israel and traveled and got to know every corner of it. Reuven loved life and knew how to live it at full power. He had a certain magic and a contagious joy for life.”\nFour months after he was killed, the kibbutz held a cornerstone-laying ceremony to establish a new dairy farm after the existing one was destroyed in an ensuing firefight.\n“Our dear Reuven died in the place he loved the most, in the dairy farm which was his life’s work,” his wife, Dorit, said at the ceremony, according to Ynet. “We feared for his life, and to our great sadness he paid with his life for his dedication to the barn and the cows.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Alexei Shmakalov, 34, of Haifa, was killed on October 7 battling Hamas terrorists at the Sderot police station.\nBorn in Ukraine, he moved to Israel with his family in 1995 when he was six years old. He had celebrated his 34th birthday less than two weeks before he was killed.\nHe is survived by his parents, Igor and Yelena, his sister Yulia and his girlfriend Lior Tasa. He was buried in Haifa on October 11.\nA career officer with the Yamam counter-terror unit, his friends described him as modest and unassuming, determined to succeed, who enjoyed working out at Crossfit and was also pursuing a degree at Bar Ilan University.\nFauda star Idan Amedi, who was later himself wounded fighting in Gaza, wrote on social media about Shmakalov, whom he served alongside during their mandatory military service.\n“The strongest soldier, determined and yet also optimistic and smiling, who I had the privilege of being his friend and commander,” wrote Amedi. “We all learned from you and from your uncompromising journey to continue with all our strength always, without fear and without self-pity. You were the pride of all of us when you became a Yamam officer and we went to sleep feeling safe when we knew you were on guard.”\nAfter his death, a personal notebook with Shmakalov’s writings was discovered, and his family shared excerpts with the Walla news site.\nIn April 2022, two weeks after a deadly terror shooting attack in Tel Aviv, Alexei wrote: “I am fighting the good fight, perhaps the best of all. Not for honor, not for money, but so that good can triumph over evil and darkness. No matter what history records, I know what side I am on, who was behind me, with me, against me. I am with my people against the enemy. There is no connection more binding than that. I want it to be that way as much as possible, forever… I am ready. I am calm.”\nHis friend Vadim Mel wrote on Facebook, “Alexei, you were always and will always be a role model to me and a figure to admire. Part of who I am today is because of you. You always set a high standard for all of us of morals, values, strength, perseverance, determination and aspiration to excellence combined with modesty.”\nMel recalled a conversation they once had, “where you said that if you die I should speak about how ‘shit’ you were because it didn’t seem logical to you that everyone who is killed is a king and a champ and a good soul. So I thought a lot about what was not good in you. What can I tell people Alexei was shit at? With my hand on my heart, the only thing that comes to mind is that you were really, really bad at being on time… I’m sorry, you were just too good at everything.”\nShmakalov lived in Moshav Hibat Zion with his girlfriend, Lior, who memorialized him in a local newsletter: “Alexei was a person who lived by the book,” she wrote. “He knew how to do everything fully, as needed. That’s how he was as a boyfriend, a brother, a son and a partner. He always worried about the well-being of others before he took care of himself. He loved everyone and made sure to show them as much as possible… Every day Alexei made sure to make me feel that I was the most important person. Ironically he made everyone feel that way.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

When they spotted the terrorists, they got out and ran, trying to hide in bushes on the side of the road. His friends managed to survive, while he was shot dead by the terrorists as they fled.\nHe is survived by his mother, Julia Shindel, stepfather Igor Shindel, and his stepbrother Guy and younger brother Ben. He was predeceased by his older stepbrother Adam.\nHe was buried on October 13 in Netanya.\nHe was slated to begin his studies in civil engineering at Ben Gurion University in Beersheba, following two years of preparatory studies in the city. He had left his parents’ home in Chicago, where they moved two years ago, only a few days before he was killed, returning to Israel to begin the new school year.\n“I said to him good luck and see you next summer,” his mother, Julia, told a local Chicago news site of their final goodbye. “Every day we are thinking about him… It’s really terrible because Mark was here [in Chicago]. It was like four days. Four days.”\nAt his funeral, his close friend Orel Dorf — who was with Mark at the rave and survived — said: “I will never forget the moment that we hid in the bushes side by side under the horrors above us. You looked in my eyes, shook my hand and said, ‘Orel, we will get through this together,’” he said, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nOn a podcast months later, Dorf said that the pair were friends “through partying, laughter, traveling abroad — our friendship was mostly chilling and fun.” When the rockets began they reacted with surprise but little panic, “laughing about it, Mark was hitting on girls during the rockets — that’s Mark.”\n“I never imagined in my life I would write a eulogy for a friend at age 23,” he said. “He’s definitely up there, in heaven, sitting there and laughing at all of us from above, smoking a cigarette, drinking, chilling, he’s definitely having a good time.”\nMark loved tattoos and his arms and legs were covered in many, including one dedicated to his stepbrother, Adam, who took his own life several years ago. He loved playing and watching soccer, especially his beloved team, Maccabi Haifa.\nHis close childhood friend, Jonathan Senik, wrote on Facebook marking a month since he was killed: “You’re not a friend to me, you’re a blood brother, and if I could have taken the bullet to save you, I would have done it,” he wrote.\n“When we were in sixth grade we decided we would be businessmen — 10 years later, when I came to visit you in Chicago, and we looked at the buildings in the city, we thought that the day would come when you would be the one to build a tower,” wrote Senik.\n“You told me that was your dream. We even thought that you would build a music school for me, or a concert hall,” he continued. “I promise that I will do everything in my power to memorialize you. Among the Jewish people, we sit for a week after death, to understand the situation, a month to accept the loss, and a year to get used to the new reality. I haven’t accepted. I don’t want to accept.

He was buried in Srigim on October 12.\nBefore enlisting in the army, he completed a year of national service at a rehab clinic for youth, and received several commendations throughout his military service, his family said.\n“They fought for an hour next to the Kerem Shalom fence, and they killed dozens of terrorists,” his sister, Yael, told Israel Hayom. “At some point Tomer went up with his marksman on a small hill, to check out the situation, and was shot through his helmet. He was killed on the spot and the marksman was wounded.”\nAfter his death, Yael said, his family found a diary in which he wrote about his responsibilities as a commander: “It was important to him to be moral and ethical, and in these notebooks he organized for himself his approach to commanding. It was important to him to be a role model for the soldiers, to aspire to excellence and to show that racism is considered a red line.”\nShe said that he learned Arabic from a Druze soldier he served with and deepened his studies with a course in Abu Ghosh while on break, “and when he moved to serve near Gaza, he understood that it’s a really important issue, and even thought about moving there after he was released from service,” noting that they had also planned to travel together to Nepal when he finished the army.\n“It’s a little bit comforting to know that Tomer knew what to do in the critical moments, that he saved many residents of Kerem Shalom,” Yael added. “He died as a soldier of peace, he didn’t want this battle, but he knew to be loyal to the values and the goals, and how to accomplish them.”\nHis father, Ran, told the Channel 12 news site that “the soldiers who took part in that battle told us that Tomer handled the event in a very professional and good way,” noting that his constant state of readiness meant the platoon had ammo for hours of fighting. “It was just like in training, he gave orders and he was in full control, he didn’t look panicked or scared — the opposite, he was calm, knew what he wanted to do.”\n“Tomer always wanted to do his very best,” his father added. “Tomer was the kind of person who did things seriously and deeply. There was no bad in him, he was pure and kind.”\nRan said that the family is still deep in mourning months later: “The loss doesn’t end after the shiva [mourning week] or a month, or 100 days. The pain continues with us and we just hope that there will be peace and that there won’t be other families who will experience this pain.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Shay Ashram, 19, an observation soldier in the Border Defense Corps’s 414th unit from Rehovot, was killed when Hamas terrorists overran the Nahal Oz IDF outpost on October 7.\nSpeaking to Channel 13 news, her father, Dror, said she called them that morning to say goodbye when she realized she would not make it out alive. Her family said during that phone call she also asked them to go to her aunt’s house instead because they didn’t have a bomb shelter at home.\n“She said, ‘Mom, Dad, I love you, I want to say goodbye to you,'” he recalled. “‘Dad, you don’t understand what’s going on here, there are terrorists in the base, there are terrorists everywhere’… I couldn’t believe that was our last conversation.”\nShay was buried in the Rehovot military cemetery on October 10. She is survived by her parents, Sari and Dror, and her siblings Erel, Tehila and Shachar.\nDror said that Shay was supposed to be released from the observation soldier position because of her back problems, “but she fought to stay an observation soldier, she fought for it.”\nSpeaking to the Kan public broadcaster, Dror described his daughter as “a charming girl, a gifted girl. Yes, everyone says that about their children, but really, I would always laugh with her because I’d say, ‘You have a test tomorrow,’ and she’d say ‘Daddy, don’t worry, it’ll be OK,’ and I’d say, ‘But you have to study,’ and she’d say, ‘There’s no need.'” Later, he said, he’d ask her how she did: “‘100′ or ’98.’ Always like that.”\nHe said she was friends on base with Noa Marciano, who was kidnapped by Hamas and murdered in Gaza, and Ori Megidish, who was kidnapped and later rescued by the IDF, and the trio would post TikTok dances together: “They were so happy, having parties, dinners together. [Shay] always took care of everyone, was always laughing, enjoying life, very opinionated — when she wanted something, nothing stood in her way.”\nOn October 5, the trio posted one last TikTok video, dancing to a song in their army uniforms with the caption “energies of a [shift] at 4 a.m.” — never dreaming that less than 48 hours later they would all be kidnapped or killed.\nTwo months after she was killed, Shay’s sister Shachar wrote on social media: “My Shay. Who could imagine that you would stay forever 19?”\n“Who would believe that I won’t get to see you get married and have children? I was so looking forward to making your potential groom sign on the contract, ‘No returns,'” she joked. “Because how much can anyone handle your craziness? I wish so much that you will come and we can just go crazy together. And fight and laugh and get annoyed. I just want you back so much.”\nHer mother, Sari, wrote on Facebook marking 30 days since she was killed: “30 days of agony and heartbreak, my heart refuses to believe that you won’t come home again and ask, ‘Mom, what did you make for me to eat? What’s your schedule today?'”\n“My Shusha, I’m sorry I couldn’t be there to for you to help you, sorry I didn’t protect you from the murderers,” she continued. “Rest in peace my beautiful girl, send me strength so I can continue to live without losing my sanity. I love you and I miss you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

When the rocket exploded, the car was blown out of place and burned with a number of other cars… Yazan was killed. He was blown into parts.”\nYazan’s father Zakaria, a driver, recalled with tears that he “was in Eilat on Saturday morning when I learned of my son’s death.

    "story": "Sgt. Nathanel Young, 20, a lone soldier from the United Kingdom serving in the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, was killed in action on October 7 at the Yiftah IDF outpost next to Zikim.\nHe is survived by his parents, Chantal and Nicky, and his older siblings Gaby, Eliot, Daniel and Miriam.\nYoung emigrated to Israel two years ago to join the Israeli Defense Forces. The youngest of five siblings – three of whom live in Israel – he was a former student at JFS, a Jewish school in Kenton, north London.\nHis sister Gaby told LBC radio that in his actions on October 7, “We understood from a few people that he saved lives, that he saved a kibbutz from being infiltrated by terrorists. That is a heroic action.”\nHis brother, Eliot, told Sky News, “Nathanel always had strong Jewish pride. From a young age he has always wanted to play an important role in defending his country — it’s something he talked about a lot.”\nEliot added that “Nathanel was also a bubbly guy who my two little daughters loved playing with and were always so excited to visit. When Nathanel could have taken his days off to sleep and re-energize, he instead found out where we were, which wasn’t always so close to him, and came to join us.”\nAt his funeral at Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem on October 9, Eliot eulogized his younger brother: “Nat said, from the age of 10 or 11, that he wanted to serve in the IDF and protect Israel. He had such a deep connection to the country.”\nHis sister Gaby also paid tribute to him: “He arrived and managed to continue to follow his passions by dog-sitting, working out on the beach, getting a job as a DJ at one of Tel Aviv’s most famous clubs, and joining the IDF. He found true happiness in Israel and it was infectious. His selfless kindness was so rare, and I aspire to be as kind as him.”\nIn the middle of the funeral, blaring rocket sirens interrupted the service, as the Iron Dome air defense system could be heard intercepting rockets from on high. The funeral continued after the sirens ceased.\nHundreds turned out to pay their respects to Young, most of whom did not know him personally, including Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion.\nCol. Yoav Mordechai, former commander of the Jerusalem Brigade, addressed the mourning Young family at the funeral: “Be proud of Netanel, he was a hero. We, the Golani Brigade, are your family, now and forever. You will forever be a part of the Golani Brigade.”\nShortly after the one-week mourning period, Young’s parents, Chantel and Nicky, followed in their children’s footsteps and moved to Israel.\n“We need to be in the place where our son is, in the country that he fought for,” they said in a statement. “Nathanel realized his dream to protect the State of Israel with bravery and determination. We are all so proud of him and miss him so.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

They were sheltering alongside Sefi Genis and Gal Navon, who were also both killed along with Limor when terrorists fired inside the structure. Alina said that Limor embraced her as the terrorists fired, undoubtedly saving her life.\nLimor texted her brother from inside the shelter: “I’m so scared, tell everyone that I loved them. Everyone is dying here… I’m bleeding to death.”\nEight days later, her body was found, and she was buried on October 15 in Beersheba.\nShe is survived by her husband, Herbert, three children, Ori, Ofek and Ariel, as well as her parents and siblings. An accountant by trade, Limor was remembered as a devoted friend who loved to dance the night away.\n“She was always looking to dance,” her sister, Adi Atias, told Kan. “In recent years she connected very much to women’s circles, retreats, parties… She was looking to live.”\nHer friend Limor Zano Klein wrote on Facebook that they had been friends in high school and reconnected seven years ago while getting their master’s degrees.\n“You went out to dance like you loved and you just never came home,” wrote Zano Klein. “Thank you for the privilege of walking alongside you on your journey. Thank you for all the moments of enjoyment and fun that we experienced together, at raves, on the beach, during our deep conversations and intense experiences we had together… You are always in my heart.”\nHer friend and coworker Simona Gosalker wrote, “I will remember your smile forever, you brought so much light into the office, so much energy. My heart is broken and refuses to believe… your true love was to dance to the beats of music and that is what you did until your last moment.”\nHer friend Diti Alon described her as “so much life inside one woman — so much smiling and dancing and flying — how can I even describe that Limor the powerful is no longer. After all, she is a genius in everything. She would scoff that I was falling into cliches. Perhaps she still is.”\nMarking 100 days since she was killed, her sister Adi wrote on Facebook about: “100 days that you’re not here, 100 days of endless longing, 100 days of living with a broken heart, 100 days of loving you, from afar, too far,” she wrote.\n“My sister, my love, my soul, I love you.

Astapenko was laid to rest in Netivot on October 10.\nAstapenko was working as security at the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re’im early Saturday morning, when Hamas terrorists stormed the party, killing at least 360 people.\nWhen hundreds of rockets fired from the Gaza Strip began flying overhead around 6:30 am, Astapenko and her fellow officers rushed to evacuate partygoers at the outdoor rave. She was shot and killed by a squad of terrorists that opened fire while police were giving first aid to a wounded party attendee.\nSgt. First Class Sagie Abitbol told Channel 14 that he and Astapenko headed to the main road amid reports of shooting there and began treating gunshot victims, as two jeeps full of more than a dozen terrorists arrived.\n“Alona calmly, with great bravery, alongside me, shoulder to shoulder” began battling against the terrorists, Abitbol said, as they tried to provide cover to the wounded partygoer. They decided to run for a water pipe to take up a position against the terrorists, “and as we ran Alona was wounded, fell next to me. I kept fighting — her next to me gave me even more strength to fight to try to save her.” But he could not manage to save her in time.\nBorn in Belarus, Astapenko moved to Israel with her family at the age of two in 2000 and studied at the Kfar Silver youth village near Ashkelon.

Alona stood up fiercely to dozens of Hamas terrorists and saved many lives.”\n“She died that we may live. A true heroine. RIP,” he added.\nEden Kat wrote on Facebook that her death is “a huge loss.

    "story": "Shachar Zemach, 39, from Kibbutz Be’eri, was killed fighting a Hamas invasion of the kibbutz on October 7.\nAs a member of the kibbutz’s rapid response team, he was recognized as a fallen soldier with the rank of sergeant major in the reserves.\nAccording to Reuters, Zemach and other members of the Be’eri security team, including Eitan Hadad, were guarding the kibbutz dental clinic, which became an ad hoc triage center, as several wounded people lay inside, being treated by Dr. Daniel Levi and paramedic Amit Mann.\nBut Zemach and Hadad ran out of ammunition and retreated inside the clinic. One survivor heard Zemach shout in English: “Please, I’m not your enemy,” before there was more shooting and another grenade was thrown. Hadad, Levi and Mann were also slain alongside him inside the clinic.\nZemach’s funeral was held in Modiin on October 15 and he was laid to rest in Be’eri a day later. He is survived by his wife Ofri, their two children, Ella, 4, and Netta, 2, as well as his parents Shlomit and Doron and his younger siblings Yarden, Itai, Shai and Ido.\nA native of Be’eri, he grew up in the kibbutz, and after his army service got a degree in economics and politics at Ben Gurion University in Beersheba. He worked for many years at the Finance Ministry in Jerusalem, before three years ago when he decided to accept the job of Chief Financial Officer at the Be’eri print shop, according to a kibbutz eulogy.\nZemach was at one point a prominent left-wing activist, member of Meretz and participant of Breaking the Silence, a group of IDF veterans who speak out about what they say are abuses against Palestinians they witnessed while carrying out during their service.\nThe organization noted that Zemach was a “man of peace, beloved and kind,” who worked with them in the past in organizing tours in Hebron for activists and journalists.\n“He was killed with an M16 [rifle] in his hand, but in his other hand there was always an olive branch,” his father, Doron, told Channel 13 news.\nHis wife, Ofri, told the TV network that it was hard to come to terms with his loss because “Shachar was really the definition of living, of a person who wants to take life by storm, if he sat at home he had FOMO [fear of missing out], he couldn’t sit at home and do nothing, he felt like he was missing out on life.”\nHis brother, Ido, said, “For me, he was truly a role model. I didn’t say it to him too much.”\nThe kibbutz eulogy noted that Shachar was a dedicated runner and loved to play and watch soccer games — especially Liverpool or Maccabi Haifa — and to travel and hike around the country. He loved sitting around a bonfire and cooking on it, and also always helped to organize the kibbutz outings.\n“His friends said he was the ultimate combination of serious and lighthearted: By day he wore the suit of a CFO, at night he lit a bonfire with the kids, and when they went to sleep he would invite his friends over to smoke hookah,” the eulogy reads. “Shachar was a man with a thirst for life, who loved others, an optimist, brave who saw every challenge in life as an opportunity. This is how we will remember him, and this is how we will continue to talk about him to his children, Ella and Netta.”\nHis mother, Shlomit, told Channel 13, “Shachar was a wonderful kid. As a mom when I gave birth to him, I felt like the happiest person in the world — to be a mom was all of my dreams coming true,” she said.\nShe always felt lucky that all of her children lived nearby in Be’eri, Shlomit said.\n“I was blessed that all my children were around me, I was the hen, I laid chicks, I want all my chicks to be around me,” she said. “And until now they were always nearby.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

It was only then that he discovered Adir’s head was missing. The family was relieved when soldiers were able to recover it from Gaza and place it in his grave.\nAdir was remembered by his loved ones as a quiet boy who was considerate of others and dreamed of serving in Golani.\nHis mother, Sigal Tahar, wrote on Facebook: “Adir Tahar, a hero of Israel.

He would do everything to make me smile, he was my other half… we could sit and look at each other and just laugh. We could have deep conversations of days without sleep… his smile and his laughter were the most beautiful things the world has shown me.”\nIn an interview with a local Jerusalem outlet, David described his son as “a modest boy, humble, responsible and serious,” noting that he excelled in high school “and was loved by his friends and all of the school staff.”\nDavid said that Adir was on duty until 1 a.m. and stayed with the person who replaced him until 3 a.m. before going to sleep. At 6 a.m. they were awakened by the invasion warning “and he immediately got into uniform and flak jacket… Adir ran straight ahead with another five people and the platoon commander.

She sought refuge in a roadside bomb shelter near the entrance to the city, then when things appeared to calm down again, got back in her car and was shot dead by Hamas. Her body was found several days later.\nShe is survived by her parents, Malka and Meir, and her five siblings, and was buried on October 10 outside Netivot.\nGabay, an aspiring singer-songwriter and event producer, worked as a cook at the Mileva pub in Beersheba. A post by the restaurant described her as “an inseparable part of the staff, a talented cook, with hands of gold and a huge soul and endless smile. Mori, our love, we will continue to memorialize the good you brought into the world and you will always be in our hearts.”\nHer father, Meir, noted to Ynet that “in her short life, Mor managed to complete two years of national service, served a full IDF service and continued past the mandatory period.”\n“Mor was a fighter, she was an independent child,” he told 103FM. “As a father, it feels like I lost a part of my body.”\nKnown for her love of music, several of her friends memorialized her through songs. Her friend Kay Ben Salmon wrote a song titled “Zoe and Ted,” after her beloved dogs, writing that “during the entire past month it has been so sad to see their expressions, waiting every day to receive all of your goodness which was ended so suddenly. This song is dedicated with great longing and a broken heart.”\nHer friend Nave Guedj used Mor’s words to compose and release “Belonging to Everyone.” Guedj wrote that “Mor would write a lot of lyrics and always dreamed that her words would become songs.” After she found out about her murder, Guedj wrote, “I went into our WhatsApp messages and took the first set of lyrics I saw that she sent me, ‘You belong to everyone,’ and I set it to music. Through this song Mori is still with us, even if not physically, the song is a part of her. Mori was an angel full of light and joy, full of unconditional love and love for others.”\nHer friend Peer Somech recalled her always “with your morning coffee on the grass [in training camp], with your big smile when we were all grumpy… I loved you so much Mor, and I will love you forever, this is how you are engraved in my heart — you were a light to me.”\nHer friend Avia Paz Krispin wrote on Facebook that Mor is “the fun-ni-est person I have ever met, and you had competition. I was waiting for you to move to Tel Aviv, to start going on stage, so that dozens and hundreds and thousands of other people could hear you and cry from laughter until their stomachs hurt.”\nKrispin wrote that her pain and grief were impossible to explain: “Thank you for all the good that you brought… I was privileged to know you and thank you for every day that you were in my life.

    "story": "Yohai Ben Zecharia, 23, from Netanya, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHis father Golan said he got a call from Yohai that morning that they were shooting at him, and he got in the car to go and rescue him. Golan said he was unable to get to the party site due to military roadblocks, was forced to turn around. Every day for a week he returned to search for his son, until a week after the rave he was notified that his body had been found. Yohai was killed alongside his close childhood friend, Danielle Cohen.\nYohai is survived by his parents, Golan and Sigalit, his siblings and his girlfriend Avishag. He was buried on October 15 in Netanya.\nHe worked for a car dealership in Netanya, and helped his father out at his flower stand on weekends.\nHis girlfriend, Avishag Cohen, told the Walla news site that the couple had known each other for years as friends, “he was always right under my nose… I knew he had a crush on me but he was a year younger than me and I didn’t think of him as an option.” Until a year ago, when they reconnected, “and suddenly I received a love I didn’t think could be — a dreamy knight on a white horse.”\nShe said they soon moved in together and became inseparable, “and we were together all the time like a married couple,” noting that they had discussed getting married “but we didn’t have any money for that. We decided to wait and save up and he was going to propose on 12.12 — today I am so sad that we waited just because of money.”\nAvishag said that at 5 a.m. that Saturday morning Yohai called her “drunk and high and told me he loved me and that I was the most beautiful in the world.” Later he updated her about the rocket fire, and a couple hours later told her there was a terrorist invasion and he was trying to find a weapon. That was the last time they spoke.\nHis father, Golan, told a local news site that his son was always ready to help others: “I’ll never forget when he was 12 and he was sitting with a blind man who couldn’t find his house, and he called me and waited until I came to help him.”\nHe said his son also loved animals, “and every wounded animal he found came home with him and I turned into a veterinarian. He adopted a dog for a year and treated her like a queen.”\nGolan said he operates a flower stand, and when his son came to work with him, “he said, ‘Why don’t we give flowers to soldiers for free?'” So they posted a sign reading “free flowers for soldiers,” he said, “and we received much more respect and recognition from people. It’s all thanks to him, he was all heart and everyone will remember his wide heart.”\nNow he has a new sign on display: “Free flowers for soldiers in uniform — in memory of Yohai Ben Zecharia.”\nGolan, told Arutz Sheva that “he was an angel, just a good kid, a rare boy, the best kid in the world… He loved people, he loved everyone. He loved everything, people, animals, birds.”\nGolan spoke to the news outlet at the site of a memorial set up near the rave: “This was his final place. I should have been with him here, but I didn’t come.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Sahar Saudyan and Binyamin Gavriel Yona left to restock the defense battery with interceptor missiles a few hours into Hamas’s deadly onslaught. The missiles are stored nearby, but not at the battery itself.\nAll three were shot dead in their vehicle. Their bodies were recovered and identified several days later. They were the first ever Iron Dome battery operators to be killed in battle.\nNativ is survived by his parents, Esther and Hagai, and his older siblings Nofar and Kfir. He was buried on October 12 on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.\nHis family said he dreamed of an army career, and was always the first to help others, loved to cook — including for his comrades on base — and was smiling in every photo.\nHis brother, Kfir Kuzaro, told Channel 13 news that at around 8:10 a.m. Nativ sent them a selfie of himself in a flak jacket, writing, “Wow, what a morning I had, all the rockets were by me. The missiles ran out, we’re heading out to restock.”\nHis sister, Nofar Biton, told the TV network that just a few minutes before he was killed, he told her there were terrorists near the stockpile, adding: “Don’t tell mom and dad anything.”\n“He was a child of light, and joy,” said Nofar. “His smile always led the way.”\nNofar said, “Nativ said to me once, ‘If something happens to me, I hope it happens in the army. That way I won’t be forgotten.'”\nKfir told a local news outlet that Nativ wanted to undergo officer training and stay on in the army past his mandatory service. “He set it as a goal and spoke about it with us. He had aspirations to study, he loved to learn. He was a wonderful little brother who told me that he wanted to follow in my footsteps. He was the light of the house.”\nNativ’s father, Hagai told the site, “In every photo you could see his smile and his light, even when he died he was smiling. A boy who was so loved by everyone. He was even in the family WhatsApp groups of his friends.”\nHagai said Nativ “was always doing and volunteering, at school, he was the first to volunteer, and also at home, always the first to help. Also on base, he would always treat everyone — he told us all the time how much he loved us and loved home. Nativ was so unique, a special boy with a special name.”\nNofar said that his status on WhatsApp for years has turned into a last will and testament for his family and friends, reading: “Leave the next generations with a better world than the one we found.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

There, she was murdered by Hamas who shot inside the structure.\nShe is survived by her parents, Gal and Nirit, and her siblings Noa and Dor. She was buried on October 10 in Gedera.\nHer family and friends said she loved sports in general and in particular beach handball and surfing, and they held a soccer tournament in her honor in Gedera in December.\nTwo months after she was slain, her childhood friend, Sgt. First Class Liav Aloush, was killed fighting Hamas in Gaza.\nIn May 2021, during the flareup in violence with Gaza known as Guardian of the Walls, Raz was seriously wounded while serving as a Border Police officer in Jerusalem when a Palestinian attacker rammed his car into the checkpoint. She required four months of rehabilitation, and later toured the US telling her story.\n“From a talented athlete who could run 10 miles without losing my breath, I needed to learn how to walk again. Ten steps with excruciating pain was an accomplishment,” she told a group in New York in late 2022 with the organization Belev Echad, according to Ynet, which noted that she also suffered from fear, anxiety and depression following the incident.\nA year and a half after she was wounded, she completed an officer’s course, saying: “I didn’t allow the injury, the physical pain I suffer from until today, or the mental pain and anxieties, take control of my life and divert me from the path I dreamed of.”\nOn October 9, Raz was supposed to arrive in Los Angeles to speak about her experience with a group of other wounded veterans.\nHer close friend, Sharon Peretz — who was with her during the 2021 attack — told Channel 14 that he got to know “an incredible girl, with the same type of humor, the same smile, I can’t explain in just a few words what her personality was.”\nRaz’s friend Daniel Amno wrote on Instagram on October 30, what would have been her 22nd birthday, recalling how “you went through the hardest thing there is, and got up like a champion, and I looked at you as a role model, to get up and go back to fighting — and when you returned you didn’t want them to make things easy, you did everything like everyone else, and even more.”\n“Raz you are the strongest there is,” he continued. “My Raz, you are always with me in every place, you are missed so much and I hope that this is all one long dream and we will wake up and everything will be fine. I love you to the sky and back.”\nHer mother, Nirit, said that she was worried during the entirety of Raz’s mandatory service, and breathed a sigh of relief when she was released.\n“When she completed her service I was happy, that I had quiet nights, I never imagined that she would go to a party… and not come back from it,” Nirit told Channel 12. “Raz was a very happy and positive girl, what people remember from her is her laugh, she had such a contagious laugh, and she was always doing nonsense, and Raz wouldn’t want us to sink into sadness. She would want us to be strong and to keep living.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Three minutes after he got behind the wheel he was killed in an accident.”\nEven his daughter, who is in the 1st grade, knew how important her father’s work was to him. When IDF commanders came to his shiva, Moran explained, his daughter “asked them to show her that the soldiers have everything. That even now, when her father is not here, they lack nothing.”\n“You left without saying goodbye,” said Moran, addressing her late husband. “You left me with three wonderful children who love you so much and who will miss you forever.

According to Maariv, two terrorists burst into their home, and Rony managed to shoot one of them dead, but the other killed Rony and wounded Noa, who lay bleeding next to her husband’s body for eight hours before she was rescued.\nHe was laid to rest on October 22 in Kibbutz Revivim, in a temporary burial.\nHe is survived by his wife Noa, their children Yuval and Eldad, and adopted children Einat and Yaron, as well as many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Just a few days after he was killed, a new great granddaughter, was born, named Rony.\nFriends and family said he was a dedicated family man who stayed very active, including regular bike rides, and was an integral part of the kibbutz landscape.\nAccording to a kibbutz eulogy, he was born in Algeria, moving to France and then arriving in Israel at age 12, settling first in Kibbutz Re’im and then moving to Be’eri as a child to attend the school there. In Be’eri he met his future wife, Noa, when he was 17 and she came to the agricultural school. They wed at 21, and settled in Be’eri, where he became the kibbutz electrician.\nOver the years the couple served twice as emissaries in southern France, and he later studied design and architecture and worked for the Be’eri print house for many years. When his close friends were killed in a car accident, the couple adopted their two children, Einat and Yaron.\nHis niece, reality star Einav Booblil, described him as “my uncle, Rony, one of the founders of Kibbutz Be’eri, salt of the earth, who fought in every one of Israel’s wars with bravery, a man like no other.”\nHis grandson-in-law, Erick Lopez, described in the West Australian visiting the kibbutz just weeks earlier to celebrate Rony’s 80th birthday, who was “fit as a fiddle and continued his tradition of riding the same amount of kilometres as his new age.”\n“Rony died a hero, armed with a pistol; his heroics are the only reason his wife is alive to tell the story,” wrote Lopez. “The pistol used holds great historical significance. Noa’s father fought against the Nazis in World War II and confiscated the Nazi gun during combat. He kept the pistol as memorabilia before gifting it before his death to his son-in-law, Rony. Little did he know this Nazi-engraved gun would save his daughter from death so many years later.”\nA eulogy read at his funeral in the name of Yuval, who was too emotional to speak himself, paid tribute to “a father of a big and loving family, a father who did everything for everyone and knew how to answer almost any question on any topic. A father who shows up within minutes to every call, who can drill a hole in the wall and hang a shelf straight… It will take some time but we will rise from this like lions. We will rebuild ourselves anew, and we will take care of Mom.”\nThe kibbutz noted that Rony wrote in a book marking 60 years since the establishment of Be’eri, in 2006: “When I look back on my life, I am thankful to my two brothers who paved the way to Israel and to the kibbutz, and to my parents who had the courage to make aliya in their footsteps. It is hard for me to imagine that I would have developed in any other place to do so many activities. The phrase that exemplifies my life is ‘veni, vidi, vici‘ — I came, I saw, I conquered. I always aim high and feel that I have achieved what I wanted.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Shahaf Nissani, 20, an observation soldier in the Border Defense Corps’s 414th unit, from Ashkelon, was killed when Hamas terrorists overran the Nahal Oz IDF outpost on October 7.\nShe is survived by her parents, Ilana and Rahamim, and her three older siblings, Moshe, Sapir and Dolev. She was buried on October 12 in Ashkelon.\nHer first cousin, Eden Gez, was slain while attending the Supernova rave on the same day.\nA day before she was killed, Shahaf had celebrated her upcoming release from the military, after October 7 was meant to be her last weekend spent on base before her mandatory service ended on October 11 — the day her body was found.\nHer sister, Sapir Nissani, told the Kan public radio that she was “so excited” for her parting evening on base, “she gave everyone gifts, she gave them all letters, she read out loud her parting words about her experience.”\nSapir said Shahaf called them at 6:30 the next morning, “confused and crying and shaking, with terrifying noises in the background of all the girls screaming, and she said, ‘Mom, they’re shooting at us, there’s a terrorist invasion, I love you.'” They continued texting for another hour, and then the connection was cut off.\n“She also gave her phone to other girls who didn’t have their phones,” she said. “Shahaf as Shahaf, who was the biggest angel in the world, up until her last moments… gave her phone to her friends to say goodbye to their parents as well,” Sapir recounted, “instead of continuing to talk to us.”\n“Shahaf was so good, I always say that she was too good, too good for us,” Sapir said. “She never got annoyed at anyone or got mad, she saw the best in everyone.” She noted that Shahaf suffered from anxiety attacks from growing up in Ashkelon amid constant rocket fire, and overcame it with therapy to enlist in the IDF.\nHer commanders in the army “all spoke about how great she was and how she helped others… even when she was new there. It warms my heart to know that an angel lived with us for 20 years. She just left too early.”\nHer brother, Dolev Nissani, penned a tribute to “the most pure girl, good, beautiful, glowing, smiling, modest, one big heart, as everyone who knew you would testify.”\n“My little one, while my heart right now is wounded, bleeding and pained, I promise that we will stay a strong and united family, exactly as you requested in your last WhatsApp [message] in the family group, a moment before the cursed terrorists conquered your base,” he wrote.\n“The love of my life, my little duckling, I am proud to be your brother,” he continued. “Thank you for every moment we experienced together in life, you taught me what pure joy is, what optimism is, what unconditional love is, all this and you didn’t even get to see anything in life. But that’s you, always thinking about others first and then yourself.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Arie “Arik” Kraunik, 54, was killed on October 7 while battling a Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Be’eri, where he lived.\nThe head of the kibbutz’s local security team, he was retroactively recognized as a fallen soldier with the rank of sergeant major by the IDF.\nHe is survived by his wife, Sigal, their four children, Chen, Tamar, Hagar and Noa, and his sister, Rachel. He was buried on October 23 in Yehud.\nMembers of the kibbutz said he was the first to head to the gate at 6:30 a.m. that Saturday to fight back the Hamas invasion, after warning everyone in Be’eri to enter their safe rooms and lock their doors. He was killed in a gun battle with dozens of terrorists.\nA lifelong member of the kibbutz who was born there, Arik was described as an excellent athlete, devoted husband and loving father. A eulogy on the kibbutz website noted that “everywhere he went he would bring energy and leave his fingerprint. His loud voice was a vocal expression of his heart and his endless generosity, his attempt to reach as many people as possible, to unite as many people as possible. Arik’s smile, which characterized him so much, was also like a loud voice for long distances: ‘Everything with a smile,’ he would say, ‘everything with love.'”\nTwo of his daughters, Tamar and Hagar, sat down with Channel 13 news to speak about their father and their experiences surviving the horrors of October 7.\n“To me, he was a figure to be admired,” said Tamar. “He was a Zionist, who loved the country, who always convinced me to give back to the country, to give as much as possible to the country.” She noted that during her own army service, anytime she had to spend a weekend on base, “he would come every weekend, no matter where I was, to see me, to visit me — anywhere I needed him, he would come, in life, in every situation.”\nHagar said that she was choosing to enlist in the Border Police to continue her father’s legacy of protecting the nation: “Protecting the country was an iron-clad rule in our house, loving the nation, being Zionist, was something we always talked about.”\nAt his funeral, his son Chen said the pair would “speak for hours about life. When I was wounded you would call me every 10 minutes to ask, ‘How are you feeling?’ I promise to safeguard the values you gave us. To protect Mom, Tamar, Hagar and Noa. We will be strong together. Show us the way with your signs. I love you endlessly.”\nHis wife, Sigal, told Arutz Sheva that her husband “was one of the first people killed” on October 7. But we are comforted, she said, by the fact “that he saved so many lives by telling them to go into their safe rooms, by recognizing that it was an unusual incident and calling up the security team, his intuition was so right, and he so much understood that this was a different kind of incident — to me, he is a hero.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Shlomi Sividia, 37, from Ganei Tikva, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while fleeing the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nSividia attended the rave with his girlfriend, Lily Gurevitch, who was slain alongside him as they tried to flee the rocket fire. While at the festival, he bumped into his older sister, Jenny, and her boyfriend, who managed to survive and escape alive.\nJenny told CNN in early February that her brother and his girlfriend were “butchered on their way back home.”\nHe was buried on October 15 in Savyon. He is survived by his two sons, Tom, 4, and Geva, 3, as well as Jenny and his parents, Aviva and Eli.\nShlomi worked as a senior software engineer at ServiceNow and had a computer science degree from Ben Gurion University. He was remembered by his coworkers as a funny, engaging and hard-working employee who become a friend to many of them.\nHis friend and coworker Roy Konki wrote on a memorial site that he met Shlomi eight years earlier at ServiceNow, when “he stepped into my office with a huge smile and asked to speak about the topics HR and employees usually discuss. From that moment, we didn’t leave each other. We talked daily about everything, about love and basketball, and our love of basketball.”\n“We traveled across Europe to watch games together,” he continued. “We played music together, in my house, in his house, everywhere. The music was our way to communicate, to share thoughts, and to feel. A few weeks ago I bought us tickets for a music concert by our favorite rock band. This was supposed to be my birthday present for him. This band played at Shlomi’s funeral. Rest in peace, my friend. I love you.”\nSix weeks after October 7, Jenny told the Davar news outlet that “my story of survival is a story, but I mostly want people to know that I had a brother, his name was Shlomi, I loved him, and he was murdered.”\nHe was a huge lover of music, she said, “the notes literally flowed through his veins. He played the guitar, he sang, listened, performed, made playlists. He loved all genres, mainstream and underground, knew artists that nobody else did from in Israel and abroad. He also really loved trance, he went to festivals for the music. He didn’t even dance, he just wanted to hear new tracks, the way people go to a concert.”\nShlomi was an incredible father to his two sons, she said, a devoted coworker, a friendly neighbor who even learned basic Russian to connect with his elderly Russian neighbors, she learned during the shiva mourning period.\nJenny said that she’d long learned that friends and partners may come and go, “but a brother is forever. It was the only relationship in my life that stuck long term. It was meant to be me and him against the world… this is the hurdle that I think will be the hardest to overcome. After almost two months have passed, the adrenaline of survival has dissipated, and the understanding that Shlomi is not alive is only growing stronger.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He is survived by his parents, Miriam and Idan, and his siblings Tamar, Boaz, Shlomit and Avigayil.\nYonatan was only in basic training on October 7, and was off-duty spending the Simhat Torah holiday in Ofakim, at the pre-military yeshiva he had attended before enlisting, when the Hamas onslaught began. Though he was unarmed, according to media reports, he decided to head outside to try to fight back against the terrorist invasion, taking only rocks with him. He later got a knife from a soldier he encountered, his family said.\nHe then picked up a weapon that had been used by a seriously wounded policeman who had been evacuated from the scene and took it, his family said, despite not knowing how to use it. He took up position on the roof of a building and used the gun to shoot at terrorists on the street below, until he was shot dead. His family said that a day later his body was found on the roof surrounded by shell casings and with a smile on his face.\n“He was all bravery and all gentleness, exuberant joy and playfulness,” his father wrote in a eulogy. “Full of initiative and originality and with his charm winning over all those around him to fall in love with him and want to be near him. He was a loyal friend who would always jump to help, just how he jumped into battle naturally with bravery, and died a hero’s death in a battle which stopped a terrorist cell in Ofakim.”\nHis father, Idan, wrote that “they found him dead on the roof with a smile on his face. I am sure that that smile did not leave your face from the moment you entered the battlefield. Thrown on the roof of the house, with your red Shoresh sandals, a commando knife in your belt and surrounded by bullets. You looked so peaceful… goodbye my son. My love for you will never cease.”\nOn an Arutz Sheva podcast, his mother, Miriam, described her son as “mischevious, sweet, sweet, sweet, just a heartbreaker of a kid, with curls, light, laughing eyes, and always a smile — he was always happy.”\n“He dreamed of being a fighter, he was gentle and sensitive but he was very physical, he was into extreme, he did rock climbing, had a knife collection, he did a carving extracurricular activity as a kid, and also archery,” she said.\nMiriam last saw him, she said, a week before his death, on the first day of Sukkot, when the entire family was together for the holiday — a rare occasion. On October 7, she said, the yeshiva told all the students present to stay in the bomb shelter, and for those with weapons to man the entrances and exits, “but Yonatan went out anyway.”\n“Everyone who knew him wasn’t surprised” by his actions that day.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

It seems that you are Nir Oz and Nir Oz is you.” The kibbutz described Noy as “our mythological preschool teacher” for many years, who later moved to work in the laundry room “and knew every item of clothing and to whom they belonged. More than once you scolded us for not coming to pick up our laundry on time.”\n“Anywhere you worked you did so with thoroughness and diligence, and you invested care and energy in your unique way,” the eulogy read. “A big and special place in your heart was saved for your daughters and grandchildren, whose visits to Nir Oz were a source of comfort and pride at once.”\nHer relative, Rinat Shohat, wrote on Facebook that “the world should know who Shifra Noy was… modest, humble, funny, who loved to work in the kibbutz and give back to the community.”\n“She never complained when it was hard for her even though she suffered from different health problems, but mostly I will remember her as a woman of peace who only worked to reconcile others and help all of humanity,” Shohat wrote. “My dear Shifra — thank you for the privilege of knowing you, thank you for never forgetting my birthday and that of all members of the family.

This allowed other IDF troops to prepare for attack and join the fight to save the kibbutz.

My heart shrinks again and again, the pain does not lessen and the breaths are labored.”\n“It was important to me that you left on your final journey from your beloved home, from the streets where you walked all your life to nursery school, to grade school, to soccer, to friends,” she said. She recalled that he was a beautiful baby, “easy to raise, calm… a later bloomer who blossomed slowly… In recent years you reached your peak, my little boy become a young man, full of inner strength and mental power, accepting, enveloping us.”\n“Since your childhood, you always knew what you wanted, and what you didn’t,” she recalled. “I was amazed by the quiet assertiveness inside you. You always knew what you wanted, where you wanted to be, and what wasn’t right for you… You had so much modesty, respect for others, compassion and generosity,” she added. “You were always a child of action more than a child of words.”\nAdi was a major fan of Real Madrid, and goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois sent a video to his family praising him as “a real hero” and sending them his support.\nOn what would have been his 21st birthday, Sigal and his brother Amit appeared on Channel 13 news to speak about his memory.\nMarking his birthday without him “is a joy mixed with deep sadness that can’t even be explained,” said Amit. “I had no doubt that he would jump ahead in such a situation [on October 7], but even so, for him to charge ahead when he was so outnumbered, when others were wounded, under heavy fire, without really knowing what was going on.”\nAmit said they heard so many stories after his death from friends they didn’t even know, “who told us ‘he was like an older brother to me,’ it was incredible. This kid never stopped surprising us, from the day he started walking until his last day.”\n“He had a big soul, with a lot of compassion in his heart toward people, animals, he volunteered with animal charities, he adopted a dog who had been abused,” Sigal told the TV network, noting that after his death they found many photos on his phone of him treating and helping stray dogs. “We feel a sense of enormous loss.”\nAt his funeral, his girlfriend Inbal recalled their parting moments before that Saturday, when she woke up early, “and I gave you a hug and a kiss and I said, ‘Bye.’ And you whispered to me, ‘Don’t go.’ I thought maybe you were dreaming, or you suddenly had an outburst of love, so I gave you another few kisses and I left… Only now I finally understand why you said it, but it’s too late.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was laid to rest in the Mount Herzl military cemetery on November 19.\nAirley was born in New York and moved to Ramat Beit Shemesh with his family in 2006.\nHis mother, Jennifer Averbuch Airley, described him as “always sporty and social” growing up, with a keen interest in Israeli history and Jewish law, along with hiking, breakdancing and long-distance running.\n“He had a deep love affair with Israel’s natural beauty, especially the natural springs,” she wrote on the website of “Binyamin’s BBQ Brigade,” a volunteer group supporting IDF soldiers that was founded in her son’s name.\n“His life mission was to protect the Land [of Israel] and keep it safe and thriving so all Jews could live anywhere in Israel peacefully,” she wrote. “Binyamin lived and died with that mission.”\nLater, Jennifer wrote, “When people ask how I’m holding up I pretty much have one answer: Complete and broken all at once.

He wouldn’t have liked all the attention; he didn’t want his name mentioned. He was loved and respected by everyone who met him. A leader. His smile -– shines up the room. He hated smartphones — gave it up for a Nokia.”\n“He was a ‘gibor‘ [hero]. He always wanted to be at the front. Wouldn’t have it any other way,” he added.\nSpeaking to TalkTV, Rob said that Binyamin was “extremely happy to fight and protect, there was no question that he wasn’t going to go in [to Gaza]… He died how he lived, he was always the first one in. He was the one that would motivate all the other soldiers in his unit, and he was the one who would push them.”\n“He had a really magnetic personality and people were really attracted to him, and he was able to have friends from all different sectors of a very wide Israeli society, religious people and non-religious, Arabs,” Rob continued. “He was an incredible son, who gave a lot of honor to his parents, he was very humble, he never spoke negatively about anybody.

His mother said she later found out that fellow partygoer Motti Zoherman, 73, tried to help Keshet escape, and they were slain together in his car.\nKeshet was missing for four days until his body was located and he was declared dead. He was buried on October 12 in Kibbutz Samar. He is survived by his parents, Natalia and Laurent, and his two sisters, Anan and Shemesh.\nHis last public Facebook post, on September 29, was inviting people to join him at Supernova. Festival co-organizers and twins Michael and Osher Vaknin, who were also murdered on October 7, were among those who commented on the post.\nFamily and friends said he was a ball of energy and a party animal, with long blonde curls and a curious spirit, who loved pirates, and whose favorite food was pasta bolognese. Though he grew up secular, his family and friends said in recent years he had begun to explore religion, even attending a synagogue in Tel Aviv on Simhat Torah, the night before he went to the Supernova rave.\nHis close friend, Kedem Linkhati, said she met Keshet four years ago, and that he “was the person I loved most in the world. The love of my life, I could say,” she said. “I see Keshet as a sort of ball of light, jumping, bouncing, talking nonsense, making people happy — he was really a point of light in my life.”\nIn his memory, she said, she started the “Nova Angels” website, encouraging people to do good deeds in the name of one of the people murdered at the festival, while she also fundraises to write a Torah scroll in his name — noting that the dissonance between the religious act and the irreligious party “just connects me again to Keshet, things that come from the heart.”\nHis mother, Natalia, told La’isha magazine that Keshet “had a huge smile and an enormous heart from a young age. If I would give him a square of chocolate, he would insist on giving me half — he was always happy helping others… Recently I understood that this approach only got stronger as he grew up.”\nNatalia said Keshet’s friends “told me that he would buy a bottle of whiskey for hundreds of shekels and give out shots to strangers. He would say, ‘Why enjoy alone if you can enjoy together?’ He was also a super energetic kid — at age 5 he started doing cartwheels and would walk on his hands from home to the cafeteria — the whole kibbutz said he needed to go to the circus.”\nKeshet didn’t fit in well in traditional frameworks, she said, noting his struggles in school and his decision not to enlist in the IDF, instead traveling the world and working in gardening and construction. After his death, she found a notebook in his room in which he had written prescient thoughts.\n“The day that I begin my journey in the world to come, I will be ready for it. I won’t jump toward it but I will be ready. And be happy for me that I am in a different place,” he wrote. “It will surely be confusing at first, but imagine that I flew to the island of my dreams and I won’t want to come back forever.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Noy Aviv, 29, from Eilat, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nHer father, Mati, told Israel Hayom that he called her around 8:30 that morning to warn her to stay away from the area, but it was too late. He said she fled from the scene of the party to a roadside bomb shelter, which Hamas terrorists attacked.\n“She told me, ‘Dad, do me a favor, call the police, call security, send rescue,'” he recalled. Around half an hour later, he said, they spoke again, “and she said, ‘Dad, there’s smoke coming in the bunker.'” They never heard from her again. A few days later, they were informed that her body had been found.\nShe was buried on October 11 in Even Yehuda. She is survived by her parents, Mati and Nurit, as well as her siblings and grandparents.\nAn English teacher and a talented athlete, she grew up in Even Yehuda and moved to Eilat in 2022 to work as a teacher. The Education Ministry said that she was “beloved by her students and her colleagues, she set an example and gave love and support to all her pupils.”\nBetty Manola, the principal of the Rabin School in Eilat where she taught, described Noy as “a beloved teacher in the school for a second year. Noy, a teacher of English, was thought of as a meteor in didactics, seriousness, investment and love of the child.” She noted that Noy also had a love of singing and joined the school choir.\nAfter her death, several of her friends shared a clip of her singing Adele’s “Someone Like You,” in 2019, with the lyrics — “Don’t forget me, I beg/ I remember you said/ Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead” — gaining new resonance.\nHer former student, Sapir, told Ynet that “you were more than a teacher, you were part of us. I remember when one of the bus drivers thought that you were a student because you always sat with us and spoke to us and looked us straight in the eye. You were one of those people who you only have to look at to know how good they are — we could see it in your eyes and in your smile.”\nHer friend, Tzach Arbiv, wrote on Facebook thanking Noy for their friendship: “I want to tell you that I’m happy I met you, I’m thankful for the experiences we had together, I got to know a person who was light in the world, full of good energy, joy and love. I am sure that all of your goodness and incredible energy are being spread right now in the universe with a smile on your face and dancing.”\nHer aunt, Yisraela Aviv, wrote online that it was hard to go on after “you took the joy with you, leaving us shocked and pained by our bitter fate.”\n“Thank you for being the first to give me the title aunt, you were an incredible niece, funny, beautiful, smart, kind, with many, many other good qualities. I was proud of you and I am still incredibly proud of you,” she wrote. “You are in my heart and my mind 24/7, I promise to remember you and memorialize you forever — promise me that you will keep singing with your incredible voice and dancing up there.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Also killed alongside him was Segev Shalom police station commander Itzik “Bazuka” Buzukashvili, who had arrived at the scene specifically to try and evacuate Davidov.\nIn a message informing their fellow officers of their deaths, the Rahat police station commended Davidov and his team “for being the first to go into this battle and [protecting] the residents of the areas with their bodies,” a local Beersheba news outlet reported.\nDavidov would have celebrated his 44th birthday on October 8 but was instead buried in Beersheba Cemetary on October 9. He is survived by his wife Inbar and their four children.\nAt his funeral, Inbar eulogized him as “a hero of Israel and the love of my life,” while his oldest son Tal promised to join the Israel Police forces and follow in his father’s footsteps.\nIn early November, Tal joined the Israel Border Police despite having already completed the majority of his training in the IDF’s Givati Brigade.\n“Dad put on a uniform and his protective gear and a moment before he left, he managed to give me a hug and told me: ‘Take care of yourself, don’t try to be a hero,'” Tal recounted in an interview with Ynet.\n“As soon as Dad fell in battle, I decided to follow in his footsteps,” he added. “Dad always told me that his dream was to see me in the uniform of the police, I’m making his dream come true. It’s a shame he’s not here to see it.”\nDavidov, who joined the Israel Police in 2001 and worked his way up the ranks, was remembered by Israel Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai as a man who “always had a sparkle in his eye.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

They fled for their car and tried to head home after the rockets began flying, and were murdered on the side of the road by Hamas terrorists lying in wait. The friends filmed a short video of themselves in the car trying to leave the festival, minutes before they were slain, shocked by the amount of rocket fire.\nTheir bodies were recovered several days later, and Eden was buried on October 10 in Ashkelon.\nShe is survived by her parents, Aliza and Robert, her siblings Dekel, Roni and Simcha and her twin sister, Adi.\nEden’s first cousin, IDF soldier Staff Sgt. Shahaf Nissani, was also killed on October 7 on her army base.\nHer mother, Aliza Gez, wrote on Facebook that even months after Eden’s death, she cannot come to terms with it: “I miss my mornings and nights with you — Friday mornings, good music, good spirits, ‘Mom, what should I bring,’ your comings and goings from the house — Eden, my life ended when you left,” she wrote.\n“Day is not day, night is tears, the world is crying for you,” she added. “I lost all of my joy for life, I don’t know how to go on, because I have no strength. Eden send me strength, the whole family feels your loss, every minute, every second — the joy you gave to everyone has been erased.”\nHer brother, Dekel Gez, wrote on social media that he could not bring himself to speak at her funeral: “I never imagined I would speak about you in the past tense, and to say kaddish for my little sister.”\nDekel wrote, “I will miss the phone calls, the advice, the fights that after a few minutes turned to hugs and kisses, and mostly the meetings and the holidays. I knew that you were a special person, full of generosity, and after the shiva [seven-day mourning period] I understood you are so much more than that.”\n“Thank you for what you were for me, and for us, thank you for being the aunt figure to all the nephews, and I promise you that we will continue to be united and solidified as we were,” he continued. “We were five siblings and we will always remain five siblings. I love you my dear sister with the endless smile.”\nEden’s twin sister, Adi Sabag, told Channel 12 news that she was born 24 seconds before Eden, “and she would always say that she was the youngest.”\nOn that Saturday morning, Adi said, she felt an unusual sense of overwhelming fear when the rocket sirens began in Ashkelon, “and maybe I was afraid because she was afraid? Because I don’t get afraid of sirens.”\nAdi said they had a unique bond, “she would look at me and she would know how I felt, what nobody else felt, nobody else knew. We experienced everything together. Everything.”\n“It’s hard for me to think about the rest of my life without her, that she won’t experience it with me anymore,” she added. “That I won’t feel her anymore, that I won’t see her anymore.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

One day my turn will come, I’ll bring you the hat, so everyone will know who is the mailman up there.”\nThe Israel Meteorological Service noted in a post on Facebook that, in addition to his other kibbutz duties, Shafir was a dedicated volunteer rain observer, reporting rain measurements in the kibbutz to the IMS for 54 years without fail.\n“He was meticulous about measurements even on days with scant amounts of rain,” said the IMS, who visited Shafir’s brother and sister on the 30-day anniversary of his death, presenting them with a certificate of appreciation for his lifetime of service.\nShafir’s relative, Avraham Eilat, eulogized him at his funeral, noting his legendary status after more than 50 years on the kibbutz.\n“He knew everything, knew everyone and gave everyone full service with all of his heart,” said Eilat. “His great love was for music, and in his apartment he had an enormous collected of records, cassettes and CDs including rare recordings.”\nHe had an incredible memory, said Eilat, noting that he “remembered all his relatives and all the people he met during his life, and was a reliable source for questions from all his family and friends who were searching for information… He was a walking, breathing encyclopedia for hundreds of relatives and for the family history.”\nHe concluded: “Yirmi was a kind, caring and modest person.

That was the last time they heard from him.\nHe was considered missing for a week until his family was informed that his body had been found. He was buried on October 15 in the kibbutz. He is survived by his parents, Yosefa and Arik, and his brother Dor.\nHis second cousin, Elkana Bohbot, was also at the festival and was taken hostage to Gaza.\nEdri, who served in the Golani Brigade during his mandatory IDF service, was living in a rented apartment in Afula and studying naturopathy at Reidman College. He was remembered as a lover of animals — who collected many stray dogs and cats — and a devoted fan of the Beitar Jerusalem soccer team.\nHis close friend, Daniela Gandi, wrote on Facebook, “My Idani. In my worst nightmares, I never thought I would have to eulogize you. That I would speak about you in the past tense. We got very close this past year, you became my super duper good friend. The first I would seek advice from, the first I’d go out for a beer with, the first I’d want to lose my head with when I’m a little lost.”\nGandi wrote that Idan was “a person full of humor who took life chill, just to enjoy and to receive with love because everything really was OK.

I wish I had your bravery, I was so jealous of you, that you had everything — the most handsome in the family, smart, social, generous, calm and a cook. I admired you the way a little sister admires her big brother.”\nMimi wrote, “I always said we were best friends, the person I seek advice from, argue with, but ultimately worry about the most.

He was buried on October 9 in Tel Aviv.\nHis uncle, a rabbi based in California, told a vigil a few days after his death about his nephew’s bravery.\n“When the attacks started, he realized there was only one woman soldier standing guard,” Rabbi Yonatan Cohen said, according to J., saying that he ran to join the guard and ordered the other soldiers to split up. “He acted like a commander. He acted like an adult.”\nCohen said Yoav fought back against 10 Hamas terrorists: “He protected the other soldier with his body and killed four of the 10 before he was overcome by them.”\n“Yoav did Yoav,” he said. “Of course he did,” adding that “he was a rare combination… He was a very quiet and internal person with tremendous resilience.”\nHis girlfriend, Einat Tzemach, told At magazine that they had been together for two years and that Yoav “was a Zionist type, who wanted to firstly give back to the country.” She said he was quiet and bashful and blossomed in the army when he received a distinction in his officer’s course.\nEinat said he was the oldest in his family, “always took care of his siblings, and he really wanted to build his own family. He was a crazy good cook, with a rich imagination. He sang, played, wrote songs, he studied psychology and also physics. That’s how he was — different and special, but also humane and realistic, with incredible emotional intelligence. All his friends saw him as their secret keeper.”\nShe said that Yoav would “call me his wife, we spoke about getting married and having children. We didn’t have an ego, even if we fought for a moment we would embrace, kiss and move on. We had a lot of conversations about the rest of our lives together, and I struggle to accept that I won’t have that anymore.”\nAfter he was killed, a letter was found on his body written in the final moments of his life, reading: “The best 20 minutes of my life, we crawled up here, I was wounded, there’s a volley of bullets right now, I’m thinking of you and will think all the time, I love you.”\nYoav’s parents, Maya and Alex, appeared on the Kan public broadcaster to speak about their son, the letter, and his final moments.\n“My son fought hard to get where he got,” Alex said on the TV network. “He completed his course with the highest honors, and it was very, very important to him to be the best wherever he could.”\n“I think that everyone who went out to face this horror knew that they may not come back,” he added. “I think with all the energy and passion and compassion that Yoav and the officers and soldiers had in those 20 minutes… Trying with all their strength to fight to protect us, was for him the fulfillment of everything he’d been raised on, everything he’d learned, everything he’d gathered and absorbed — I think the message to us is that ‘I didn’t die in vain. I fought.'”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Tamar Samet, 20, of Pardes Hanna, was killed by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nSamet attended the Supernova festival with Laor Abramov, the son of DJ “Darwish” David Abramov. Both Tamar and Laor were murdered while hiding in a concrete bunker outside the festival.\nTamar was considered missing for days after the attack, until her remains were found and she was buried on October 15 at the Ein Iron cemetery in Pardes Hannah.\nIn the months since October 7, Tamar has reached a certain level of fame in Israel, after a song she recorded with her best friend was released after her death.\nMusician Ben Ronen posted the song “How I Burned a Bridge” in December, while serving as a combat medic in Gaza. In an interview with Haaretz, he described how he climbed atop a hill in Gaza to get better reception and sent his Spotify username and password to a friend with instructions to post the song. After the song went live it started to get radio play and became a viral hit in Israel.\nIn the description on the YouTube video for the song, Ben Ronen said that he wrote the melody back when he was 17 years old but only played it for one person: Tamar. She was the one he trusted, the one whose opinion he valued more than any other. She told him it was the most beautiful melody that he had ever written and that it needed lyrics.\nTwo years later, he wrote, Ben decided to write the lyrics to the song and the next afternoon Tamar came to his house and started singing the lyrics. They looked at each other and both saw a spark in each other’s eyes and decided to record the track. “And that’s the souvenir I have from my best friend, with the most beautiful eyes and the biggest heart and the voice of an angel that I will miss the most. A tremendous loss for the world.”\nThe song is barely two and a half minutes long. The melody is gentle, a warm embrace upon sparse lyrics: “It happened again, I made a mistake and there is no way back. Again, I said things that I didn’t mean — they aren’t true. And how I burned a bridge, how I burned.”\nTamar’s voice shines through, angelic and captivating, burning at a low flame and driving the listener to play the song on a loop.\nIn the Haaretz interview, Ben said that he and Tamar would sit in the fields near his house at the edge of Pardes Hanna and listen to music for hours and hours. He said her favorite band was Black Sabbath but she also loved the Grateful Dead and both of them shared a deep love of Radiohead.\nHer sister Noy told Haaretz, “She really was special. She knew that and she didn’t totally accept it. She had a special style all her own, in the temperature of her mood, and in the things that she loved to do. She did things only if her heart was in it. I can’t grasp it. I still see things in the street and take a picture to send to her.”\nA former teacher of Tamar’s, Hamutal Tsur Marom, wrote on Facebook in mid-October, “Beautiful Tamar Samet, my beloved student. A singer, cello player, a musician with every bit of her soul. She was entirely light, freedom, and music. She went to dance and never returned.”\nTamar did her national service at a charity called “HaGal Sheli” (My Wave), which teaches surfing to at-risk youths and helps treat people affected by trauma.\nIn a Facebook post on October 27, Yaron Waksman of HaGal Sheli wrote that Tamar “was a dedicated educator fulfilling her national volunteer service at HaGal Sheli. She was present at the party in Reim on that ill-fated Saturday, celebrating peace and love, but she never returned. May her memory be a blessing.”\nOn a rainy day in late January, Tamar’s mother Adi posted a clip of her sitting in her car listening to Galgalatz as “How I Burned a Bridge” came from the speakers and rain fell on the windshield.\n“Our beloved Tamar you are missed, even though you’re on every radio station. Thank you so much for leaving us with a warm, embracing voice to take comfort in.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Sgt. Osher Simha Barzilay, 19, a soldier in the Gaza Division, from Mazkeret Batya, was killed on October 7 when Hamas overran the Nahal Oz IDF outpost.\nHer sister, Yarden Carmeli, told At magazine that she last heard from her sister, who was holed up in the IDF war room, at 10:23 a.m., when she texted her: “Pray for me.” A week later, they were informed that she had been killed and her remains identified.\nShe is survived by her parents, Lior and Tikva, her five siblings, Sapir, Eden, Yarin, Yarden and Chen, and her boyfriend Ori Asaf. She was buried in her hometown on October 15.\nShe was remembered for being a talented guitar and piano player and excelling in all of her studies, particularly science subjects, and that she dreamed of one day becoming a brain surgeon.\nShe took part in the very selective national neuroscience program at the Davidson Institute of Science Education, where motivated students study the brain: “Even among this very unique group of talented students, Osher stood out as one of the most impressive pupils,” her 12th grade teacher, Noa Pinsker-Zeharia, told Ynet. “She charmed us not only with her curiosity, intelligence and original thinking, but first and foremost with her empathy and kindness which she spread to all those around her — students and teachers alike.”\nBarzilay was also a volunteer with the Magen David Adom ambulance service in the Rehovot station, which she started at 2019 when she was just 15, rising up through the ranks and taking many courses to add further skills.\n“She is as her name suggests – Osher was filled with joy, always happy and with a smile, would be the first to help and assist when required, and made certain to join a shift every week and volunteer on the ambulance or MICU,” said Hila Pilosof, an MDA paramedic and youth volunteer manager at the Rehovot station. “She was a wonderful volunteer with an enchanting personality, who dreamed that she would grow to be a doctor and continue to save lives. May her memory be blessed.”\nHer father, Lior, told the Kan public broadcaster that Osher was born to him and his wife in their second marriage, after they each came with two children from their first marriages, “and she was what brought all of us together… we called her Osher [happiness], because she brought happiness.” She was an exceptional student, he said, and amid all of her many activities she also tutored many of her fellow students.\n“She used her time to the max,” he said. “When I look at this girl [who was killed] at just 19 and four months, I see that she crammed 50 years into it.”\nHer sister Yarden said that “my little sister, my whole world, I have a hole in my heart in the shape of you.”\n“You were the most beautiful, the most well-groomed, the most glamorous… when I was in my darkest place, we spent five days together Greece and you didn’t let me down for a moment. On that Sunday [October 8], at noon, I wrote to my friends that if something happens to Osher, I don’t want to stay alive.”\nOn what would have been their fourth anniversary, her boyfriend, Ori Asaf, wrote on Instagram that “life stopped at that one black moment where I finished fighting and after a week that I was disconnected, they took me aside to tell me the news. That moment that my life stopped forever, that moment the skies fell on me, my heart shattered to pieces and every organ in my body crashed.”\n“I got to be in a relationship with my soulmate, my best friend, my other half, for years our souls were intertwined and become one big soul,” he wrote. “You taught me to love, you taught me to be a person, you made me who I am today… all the time you told me that you wanted to get married young, that you wanted a cool wedding with young people, and me? I wanted to marry you so much, I kept praying that this week would end and I would return to your loving arms and I would get on one knee and propose.”\nOri wrote that “we had planned already our lives 80 years ahead, because it was clear to us that it wasn’t going anywhere, that we weren’t able to be apart… I’ll always remain your little Or [light], with a broken heart, but full of pride.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He attended the rave with his friend Ziv Shapira, who was also slain.\nHe is survived by his parents, Meirav and Ronen, and his three younger siblings.\nArad was slated to begin his fourth and final year as a student at Kinneret College studying water industry engineering.\nThe head of the water industry engineering department, Dr. Ran Suckeveriene, told Ynet that “Nevo was my research assistant in an innovative and ground-breaking research project, and I got to know a hard-working, initiative-taking and brilliant student, who was a joy to work with.”\nSuckeveriene noted that Arad was an active student who also tutored teenagers in the area, and “unfortunately he never got the news that he had been awarded the ‘presidential prize’ for his achievements in the previous academic year.”\nIn late January, his family picked up the honor in his memory.\nHis close friend, Rebecca Corcos, wrote on Instagram about “my friend, our partner in crime, how privileged I was, how privileged we all were — you were the perfect partner for all experiences. And lucky me, we experienced so much together.”\nCorcos wrote that Arad was “an inspiration to me and to everyone who knew you I am sure. You were so considerate but also the most free that could be, you did things in such a perfect way that it was annoying… I don’t really know how we keep going from here, how do we pick up the pieces amid everything and after everything. Every breathe is suffocating and comes with a million tiny daggers to every cell in the body, the heart can barely hold on anymore.”\nHis cousin, Nofar Edri, wrote about going down to the site of the massacre a few months later, noting that ZAKA told the family that “you were alone, the only person in this whole area, and somehow it was you they found. At the shiva [mourning period], I told my sisters that you were for sure murdered because you stopped to help someone who needed you, and only recently we understood that when you fled the terrorists you helped a stranger who was wounded. You saved his life, Nevo. He’s alive and he knows it’s because of you.”\nHis sister, Adva Arad, wrote on Instagram that Nevo was “the best person most of us ever met in life.”\n“Nevo is a guy whose only desire was to do good for others, and not in a cliche way, it was really his motivation,” she wrote. “Words are not enough to describe our beloved, a person who lived his life to the fullest, traveled, celebrated, studied and saw the world. A man with emotional intelligence and wisdom.”\nShe continued: “A man of values, humble and modest, invested a great deal of effort in the environment and a very ecological guy with a great awareness of his surroundings. Before he passed he said: ‘I want to leave a mark on the world’ — and he did leave an enormous mark in every one of us.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

They sprayed his car with bullets, killing him instantly. The event was filmed by the cameras at the kibbutz guard house as well as the Hamas terrorists’ body cameras.\nHis funeral was held in Rishon Lezion on October 17 and he was buried in Avshalom. Erez was a company commander in the Nahal Brigade during his military service and later served as a member of Kibbutz Sufa’s security team. He was a tour guide with a vast knowledge of Israel’s flora and fauna.\nHis nephew, Shahar Erez, wrote on Facebook that it was strange to eulogize him “when just a few weeks ago we sat at Rotem’s and ate and laughed. So many memories are rising up, from ‘climb on the tall uncle’ as a toddler, excitement to meet you on our school trip and being excited in front of the whole class that my uncle is the tour guide, to our final conversations as adults who never really grew up.”\nShahar wrote, “I hope you continue telling jokes and riddles in heaven, I’m sure everyone there will love you, they couldn’t not. You loved and knew every stone and plant in this land, and you were murdered just for living here.”\nOn what would have been his 58th birthday, his son, Dan, wrote on Facebook, “Because of who you are, I thought to myself you’d prefer to receive a happy blessing instead of a sad eulogy.”\nDan noted that he has heard from so many of his father’s friends since he was killed. “They told me what kind of person you were, and of course, I knew it all, but to get to hear it from so many people is refreshing. Between you and me, you always told me that 120 is a really extreme age to live to, and you wanted to ‘cut out early.’ I’ll admit it was a bit of an extreme way, but I accept it all for the best… You were there for so many people, you were a sponge of feelings, you took care of, helped, hugged and enveloped but now is the time to center on your own happiness — wherever you go, just be happy.”\n“Ofir was an incredibly funny man,” his wife Yael told Kan in a November 4 interview. “His humor was idiotic sometimes, but everyone loved it. He acted in the community theater. He loved to do impressions, he loved to act — it was part of his personality.”\n“We’re still together,” Yael said of her late husband. “He’s with me in my heart.” She told Kan that she still sends him WhatsApp messages nearly every day.\nMotioning to the gold pendant around her neck, Yael said, “I carry him here. Just last year, this is what he gave me for my birthday. A heart, with our faces engraved on it.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Rajan Phulara, 23, who hailed from the Shikhar municipality in the Doti district of Nepal, was murdered by Hamas terrorists on Kibbutz Alumim on October 7.\nPhulara had arrived in Israel not long before he was killed as part of the “learn and earn” yearlong internship, where he and other participants would study agriculture on the kibbutz while earning money to send back to their loved ones. Hamas terrorists killed 10 Nepali nationals during the murderous onslaught.\nHis body was sent back to Nepal for burial on November 5. Survivors said Phulara and several other Nepali interns sought safety in a bomb shelter when the rocket sirens sounded, and Hamas murdered several of them inside the shelter.\nSurvivor Dhanbahadur Chaudhari told the Guardian that the terrorists threw grenades inside the bunker and fired volleys of bullets: “When I woke up I was covered in blood and I could see my friends dead and injured around me. One friend didn’t have legs, another didn’t have hands. There were dead bodies of my friends in the door of the bunker.”\nAccording to the Nepali Times, Phulara had a BSc in agriculture from Sudur Paschim University and had hoped to return home after his studies and get a job with the civil service.\nHe was an only son to his parents, his cousin, Hemraj, told Al Jazeera, and they took his death extremely hard. Hemraj said the couple wanted to jump into a nearby river and drown after they heard the news.\n“The villagers spotted them and forcefully brought them back home,” said Hemraj.\nHis uncle, Rajendra Phulara, told Nepali Times that he had spoken to his nephew about a week before he was slain. His nephew said, “I’m going to learn new things here but I will implement them in my country, after my civil service exam,” he recounted.\nRajendra said that during their video call, Rajan turned the camera and showed his uncle how close Gaza was to the kibbutz, telling him: “That right there is Gaza… There can be an attack any time, we have been told to seek shelter in a bunker if there is one.”\nOn Facebook, his friend Talak Jung wrote: “Dear brother, your memory\nwill never fade — rest in peace.”\nThe high school he attended in Kathmandu, LRI School, wrote that it was “deeply saddened” by his death, which has “left behind an irreparable loss.”\nHis family members noted that his father had gone into heavy debt to finance his son’s studies and travels, hoping that he would return home and get a high-paying job to ease their financial troubles.\nHis cousin, Hemraj, said that “before he left for Israel, he told me all their problems would be over soon.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Livia Dickman, 24, was murdered in a terrorist attack claimed by Hamas in Jerusalem on November 30.\nThe terrorists who carried out the attack at the entrance to the capital in solidarity with the ongoing war in Gaza, were named as brothers Murad and Ibrahim Nemer, residents of East Jerusalem, who according to the Shin Bet were Hamas members and previously jailed for terror activity.\nDickman, a native of the Haredi Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof, was declared dead at the scene. She was a teacher at the Derech Emunah school in Ramat Beit Shemesh, and was on her way to work when the attack occurred. As she stood at the bus stop, she was saying her morning prayers with a siddur, or Jewish prayerbook, in her hand, according to witnesses.\nZAKA volunteers later returned the siddur to her family after it was recovered from the scene.\nShe was buried in Jerusalem on November 30 at the Har Hamenuchot cemetery.\nDickman had gotten married eight months before she was killed, and was pregnant with her first child.\nAt her funeral, her father, Yehuda, said that she “was a woman who knew what she wanted to do in life. She had a heart, intelligence and emotion and thanks to them she knew exactly what to do. She leaves behind her only good memories of a gentle smile.”\nHer father told mourners that he was comforted by the fact that she died instantly and didn’t suffer: “When I had to identify her body, I saw purity and holiness, a woman who wanted to build a Jewish home. She had such a good husband, they were a happy couple, she was dedicated to him.”\n“I thanked her for the 24 years she gave me. Such a good girl, I never had one argument with her ever,” he added. “She was a true righteous woman.”\nHer husband, Meir, noted that “I met you only a year ago. You were so righteous and so pure and wanted to do only good. All of your aspirations were to become stronger [in religious practice] and to do good.

Photos circulated showing him applying a tourniquet at the station to a wounded woman to help stop her bleeding. At 8:46 am, he texted his brother that he was wounded and needed help. It was the last time his family heard from Liam, and on October 10 they were informed that his body had been found.\nOn October 10, Noa Schechter, a fellow student from a massage course at Reidman College in Tel Aviv, wrote of the man whom she had only met three months earlier, but who had already found a place in her heart.\n“Your smile, your approach, you wanted so much to help and treat people. You only wanted to learn about the body and soul so that you could spread goodness and healing to the world!” she wrote. “And you did that up until the final moments of your life when you could be seen treating someone and stopping her bleeding — our champion.”\nLiam grew up in Dimona, where he was buried in a funeral on October 10.\nDimona Mayor Beni Biton wrote on Instagram that Liam’s friends, family members, and loved ones spoke of “a young man with a giant heart, one who was always smiling and loved people.”\nBiton described Liam, who attended Lehman High School in Dimona, as a bright, happy student who was always surrounded by friends. Biton said that “during the accursed terror attack, he helped and treated wounded people and helped evacuate other people until his last moments. A real hero.”\nIn January, more than three months after Liam was found, his brother Elay wrote on Facebook that Liam “was my entire world.” He spoke of a brother who held the keys to his soul, the one who would listen to him and calm his every worry.\nLiam was “my wall, the password that locks all the notes that I don’t want anyone to see. The person I spoke to who understood the depths of the abyss of my soul, the one who made me certain that I hadn’t lost my mind, that I’m okay, that what I said was okay.”\nHe wrote of a longing for his brother that is no longer constantly burning but rather is felt from time to time, in pleasing, soothing and harmonious notes. He also wrote of the rain pouring outside and how he no longer has his “umbrella,” Liam.\nTwo days later, on the evening of January 14, a memorial event was held for Liam at the Collabo coworking space in Tel Aviv. The event included a memorial service followed by a musical performance, a fire-and-light show, and finally, a party from 10 pm to 1 am in honor of Liam.\nOrganizers said the event would feature “some of the worlds that Liam loved, from the world of therapy to poi (performance art), anime, tattoos, and more.”\nThey added that “Liam would have wanted us to come together, to be there for one another, to get to know the people who were part of his life journey. That is why at 10 pm the Collabo will turn into a dance party, joined by our one and only angel, Liami.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

We were a duo called DNA,” wrote Conri. “And now, after he got murdered just because he wanted to help a friend to sell jewellery in a music festival and have fun, I decided that he deserves this song to be published, so everyone could hear Dor through his words and vibes.”\nHis brother, Ron, wrote on Facebook to mark “100 days, 2,400 hours, 144,000 minutes that you are not here.”\n“100 days of pain that I can’t explain in words, 2,400 hours of feeling empty and lacking that I never imagined I would feel,” he added. “My brother, I want you to know that forever we will all remember and memorialize you exactly as you were, the most beautiful boy in nursery school with pure blue eyes, the kind of kid every mom wants, always happy with a huge smile, from ear to ear, always playing and singing with enormous talent, a talent which only we and God know about because you didn’t manage to realize it the way you had dreamed.”\nDor’s mother, Vicky, told a local news outlet, “Dor was the happy kid of the family, wherever he would go he would bring light. Funny, happy, sometimes annoying, very unique. Just special,” she said. “He wrote songs, he was a talented musician, he was talented in almost everything… Music was almost his entire life.”\n“His biggest dream was to be on stage, on the biggest stages, and to perform, he was a rock star,” she added. “He just loved life in a crazy way — he took life by storm.

So instead of exploding your grave with bouquets, your funeral had seedlings of your favorite flower that people can put in the ground and allow you to continue to spread beauty, so you’ll stay connected to the land you loved all of your life.”\nMoshe Itzhaki recalled in a Facebook post getting to know Livne during his time on the kibbutz, and standing at his funeral remembering “conversations with Haim whose love for the land, his commitment and investment to developing and perfecting cultivation methods were evident in every corner of his body and soul.”\n“It was impossible to miss his human warmth and his humor mixed with his ideological fervor in an Argentinian accent,” Itzhaki added. “I remember how proud and happy he was of his pioneering way in growing seedless watermelons — how proud he was that the watermelons of Nahal Oz became a household name around Israel.”\nAt the end of the funeral, Itzhaki said, mourners were handed begonia seedlings, his favorite flower, “so that something in his memory will bloom and blossom in the hearts of those accompanying him on his final journey.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Shalev Dagan, 20, a Golani soldier from Kiryat Yam, was killed battling Hamas terrorists on October 7.\nHe is survived by his parents, Flor and Joel, his twin brother Omer and step-sisters Ofri and Carmel. He was buried on October 16 in the military cemetery in Nahariya.\nAt 5:30 a.m. on October 7, Dagan and three other Golani soldiers, Cpt. Omer Wolf, Staff Sgt. Maru Alem, and Itay Zarbib, piled into a “David” armored vehicle to do a routine patrol along the Gaza border fence.\nThey were the first to encounter the invasion of Hamas terrorists into southern Israel that morning, engaging in battle with a group of them astride motorcycles and pickup trucks. They fought for more than an hour at five different locations, preventing eight terrorists from entering Kibbutz Nirim and succeeded in delaying the invasion by two hours.\nZarbib, the driver of the David and the lone survivor of the four, told Channel 13 that the group saw a terrorist carrying an RPG launcher and tried to dodge the attack. Dagan and Alem were in the back seat; Alem jumped first and was shot dead by the terrorists, Dagan jumped second and returned fire and was hit and killed by the RPG.\nZarbib and Wolf, seated in the front, exited the vehicle to fight the terrorists; Zarbib was shot and wounded and later rescued, while Wolf was shot and killed.\nDagan’s father, who also served in Golani, said Shalev followed in his footsteps and enlisted to the brigade because of him. His family and friends described him as a fan of music and soccer — especially his devotion to Maccabi Haifa — as well as having a love of brain puzzles and riddles.\nHis mother, Flor Dagan-Reiner, told a local Haifa news outlet that Shalev “had a smile which could conquer the world, he could wipe away all sadness with one little smile. He very much loved this country. He was prepared to sacrifice everything for it.”\nFlor said that her son was “a hard-working, charismatic and captivating boy. His friends said that he was the glue of every event. Every time he came home, it was a party for all of his friends. He was the type who would enter a room and fill it with light.”\nShe said she last spoke to Shalev on Friday evening, the night before he was killed, “as always he made sure to call me and keep me calm. To wish me a Shabbat shalom. He always knew how to raise my mood — even in our last conversation he laughed and made fun of me. Any time I was in hard times he knew how to lift my mood and make me happy.”\nHis father, Joel, told Haaretz that Shalev was “a very charismatic and talented kid from a very young age. He was successful in school, a gifted athlete, and very beloved socially. Every goal he set for himself he achieved.”\nShalev would have turned 21 on November 15, 2023.\nMarking that day, his twin brother, Omer, wrote on social media: “Mazel tov my twin brother, today we are 21.”\n“Know that I love you endlessly and beyond. My beloved hero, I am proud of you my brother, you showed me the worth of the last name Dagan,” he continued. “Thank you for always being there for me, for always putting a smile on my face. I always searched for you with my eyes, it did me good to see you happy, and I hope that you are happy now and are celebrating the way only you know how.”\nOmer added: “I don’t know how to celebrate without you, this day feels empty. I miss you, my brother, in our nonsense, in everything — since the preemie ward I never left you, and you never left me — 21 years full of you. I promise that I will walk with you forever.

Her boyfriend, Ariel Biton, was also killed that day.\nEden was buried on October 11 in Rishon Lezion. She is survived by her parents, Meirav and Uzi and her younger brother, Roei.\nShe was born in Thessaloniki and would spend summers as a child at a camp in Greece while growing up in Israel.

The girl who was always looking for action. Who always loved to go out and enjoy and take life by storm.\n“You were simply one big heart.

So many of my dreams were with you as a duo… We had so many plans and those plans were supposed to happen only with you. Because you were my best friend in the world.”\nHer friend Stav Nurieli told a Greek news site that Eden “loved music, painting, tattoos. She was funny and full of love for the world.

We were team leaders, we slept together… ‘Love and peace,’ that’s what Eden would say today if she was here.”\nHer uncle, Lior Shikva Assia, wrote on social media that Eden was his niece but he always thought of her as “my little sister. My soulmate and my keeper of secrets. My Edena. You’ve left me with a shattered heart that already misses you.”\nLater, Lior wrote, “When I think about the fact that my children will hear so many stories about Eden (because there is so much to tell), it kills me that they won’t know her… With all the pain, the sadness, the thoughts, the longing and God knows what else we’re carrying with us day to day, I am sure and I know that Eden would want us to have fun.”\nHer younger brother, Roei, said on the Kan public broadcaster that Eden “was the heart of our home, truly, now it’s so hard… Eden was a girl who lived life, every moment in her life, she knew how to live it. She didn’t care what people said about her, she was just herself.”\nHer mother Meirav noted on social media that, “from a young age Eden was discovered to be very talented at drawing… Eden painted on canvases in varied sizes, and developed a line of products with drawings on different objects related to the ocean and nature, on surfboards, on matkot [paddle ball], planters and more.” Her mother noted that she also did face painting and drew tattoos.\n“Eden’s driving force was to experience the world, to be surrounded by family and friends,” she added. “She loved to travel in Israel and even more loved to fly and see the world.

He was buried on October 19 in Kibbutz Revivim. His former father-in-law, Raffi Mordo, was also murdered in the Hamas onslaught, and buried the same day.\nHis childhood friend, Tsvika Yechilzuke, recalled growing up with him in Givatayim, and visiting him a number of years ago in Be’eri, “where he established his family and lived most of his life until that cursed Saturday.” Learning of his death, he wrote, “slowly brings back memories of from being dumb teenagers, amid the sadness.”\nThe kibbutz eulogy described Mor as being very active in his life, bike riding, playing tennis, and working out at the gym, but also as a film buff and a big reader, who cherished his set of encyclopedias. He was a huge lover of animals, collecting a large number of cats and dogs along the years.\nOver the years he worked at a variety of jobs in the kibbutz, the eulogy noted, including as a tennis coach, at the print house, in gardening and later washing cars at the auto shop. Even when he wasn’t officially working as a gardener, he would always take care of the kibbutz greenery and his own yard and gardens with great care.\nHe met his wife, Tamira, when he was 16 during a visit to Kibbutz Be’eri, and years later they married and settled on the kibbutz, where she had grown up, and they raised their own family.\nDuring the First Lebanon War in 1982, the eulogy recounted, he was called up to the reserves, stationed at Beaufort in south Lebanon. He returned, the kibbutz wrote, “with scars on his soul. From reserves he came home a different person.” He and Tamira ultimately got divorced.\nHis son, Tomer, was cited as still recalling happy memories among his father’s many struggles, noting their “trips in nature, kumzitz [bonfire] with sweet hot tea they made together, sleeping in a tent, going bowling, traveling to Eilat… playing matkot [paddle ball] on the Tel Aviv beach and making huge sand castles, which he would always send photos of to Yael.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Her partner, Gadi Mozes was also kidnapped and was freed from Gaza in January 2025. Doron’s half-brother, Ravid Katz, was killed on October 7 and his body taken hostage and retrieved by the IDF in July 2024.\nEfrat was originally kidnapped with them, seen in video on the back of a truck with her daughter and granddaughters being taken by Hamas from the kibbutz, but at some point she was killed in the crossfire and the terrorists dumped her body, which was later recovered. On April 6, an IDF investigation revealed that she was likely killed by Israel Air Force helicopter fire while being kidnapped.\nShe was buried on October 25 in Kibbutz Revadim. She is also survived by another daughter, Leeor Katz-Natanzon, and two additional grandchildren, Sahar and Ziv.\nHer childhood friend, columnist Benny Avni, recalled in The New York Sun being in the same class as Efrat: “Our age group was named Shahaf, or Seagull. Efrat was a kind, gentle girl and, unlike some of us, I can’t remember her ever picking a fight with any classmate.”\nA eulogy posted by the kibbutz noted that Efrat hailed from the southern Israeli kibbutz of Kfar Menahem, and that in the year before her death both her mother and sister died, but she found comfort amid the loss in her daughters and grandchildren.\n“Efrat very much loved the fields of Nir Oz and Alumim and worked in pest control for many years,” the eulogy noted, adding that “the field with its colors and smells and plants were the substance of her life.” She also worked as a kibbutz secretary and in human resources “with thoroughness, commitment, order and organization.”\nHer daughter, Leeor, wrote on Facebook that each morning she asks herself, “How can it be that the sun is shining and you are not here… Mom, how can I even say goodbye?”\nShe noted that she was always very close to her mother, finding it hard to part even during overnight school trips, “and even in recent years when you would travel to tour with Gadi, the longing would throb.”\nShe was “the ultimate, perfect, most indulgent grandmother,” Leeor wrote. “You always knew what they wanted before they opened their mouths. I can’t even imagine how we will live without you. You are their air to breathe — and they yours.”\n“Not a day goes by that I can comprehend that you are not here with us,” she added. “Not a day goes by that I don’t miss you, a million times. Not a day goes by that I don’t scream until you can hear me that I love you.”\nMarking 100 days since she was killed, Doron — who was not at her mother’s funeral — wrote on social media about the somber and challenging period since.\n“100 days,” she wrote. “100 days ago is the last time I saw you, Mom. 100 days ago is the last time you hugged my girls, your granddaughters whom you loved more than anything and who you protected with your body.”\nDoron continued that “100 days ago, I held you, in your final breaths, and I told you for the last time that I loved you. 100 days ago you left me, too early! It’s been 100 days that Raz and Avivi don’t stop talking about you and are just waiting for you to come through the door with a box of croissants.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

At one point they heard gunshots outside, which they later discovered were the shots that killed Chen and her friends.\n“They were so close,” Noam told Ynet. “But just two minutes before they got home, the terrorists killed them.”\nPer an Army Radio tweet, Chen was looking forward to her upcoming trip to South America before she was killed.\nNoam and Chen were, he said, “like cat and mouse” in their sibling relationship. “She would annoy me and I, with my short fuse, would get angry. We loved each other,” said Noam.\nAfter his sister’s death, it became particularly important to Noam to fight for his country, and Ynet reported that he enlisted in the IDF in early December to join the Combat Engineering Corps. “With all the concerns and fears,” he said, “you have to stand up and protect your home.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

On July 24, 2024, his body was recovered by the IDF in Gaza and returned to Israel.\nHis brothers told Kan public radio that he and two other IDF soldiers arrived at Nirim and entered into a gun battle with dozens of Hamas terrorists. When the Brigade chief, Col. Asaf Hamami, was wounded, “Tomer sort of took control and led the battle against an unimaginable amount of terrorists, while he tried to care for the brigade chief and radio for help several times.”\nThey said that residents of Nirim told them that were it not for the bravery of Ahimas, Hamami and Sgt. Kiril Brodski, “The kibbutz would have absorbed an even greater tragedy than it did that Saturday.”\nA funeral was held for him in Lehavim on November 29, 54 days after he was killed. He is survived by his parents, Moshe and Anat, and his siblings Maya, Gil, Eyal, and his twin brother Amir, as well as his girlfriend Shay-li Hen.\nAt his funeral, his older brother Eyal noted, “You never once needed me to protect you, you were always able to manage on your own. I am sorry Tomer, that the one time in your life that you needed, I wasn’t there to protect you.”\n“I was privileged that you rejoiced with me at my wedding, but you won’t get to meet your nephew,” he added. “I promise that he will know who his Uncle Tomer was. I got to see you grow up to be the smartest, most sensitive and kind troublemaker… you will always remain Tomer the smart, the handsome, with the captivating smile. I miss you endlessly.”\nSister Maya noted at the funeral that Tomer and his twin Amir “were inseparable, always together. This is the first time that you were really parted, each one in his own way, each one into combat. The fear that something would happen to you accompanied me always, the fear that you wouldn’t stay together anymore.”\nHis girlfriend, Shay-li, said at his funeral, “I thought we would be together forever, but I didn’t think that forever was so close. You are a ray of light on a dark day, the most loving embrace, my morning, afternoon and night… every ‘good morning’ from you made my morning truly better.\n“You always said that I taught you how to love, but you taught me what true love is,” she added. “We were together for nine months, and each day was better than the last… I fell in love with your laugh, your cynicism, the way you saw things. The fact that you had an answer for every one of my questions, that you stood for what you believed in, your persistence in wearing soccer t-shirts everywhere.\n“You are my hero, you changed me, you supported me, you made me a better person,” she said.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Yossi is survived by four of his children, Efrat, Dorit, Segev and Maayan, and many grandchildren. His son, Maoz, was killed in a tragic accident in June 2023.\nYossi’s ex-wife, Shifra Noy, was also murdered in Nir Oz on October 7.\nAmid the destruction of the kibbutz, their families had to wait several weeks before their bodies were located and their deaths confirmed. Rivka was buried in Nir Oz on October 27. Yossi was buried on October 22 in Petah Tikva.\nA post on the kibbutz Facebook page about Rivka noted that they would miss her “mobility scooter decorated with colorful children’s toys, which was used by both you and Yossi, as you called him during your beautiful days together in Nir Oz.” The kibbutz noted that she had arrived there as a young woman with a youth group, and over more than 50 years living there, worked in the local shop as well as the kibbutz laundromat, “taking care of our clothes with dedication: folding, ironing and repairs.”\nThe kibbutz noted that Rivka loved to create things with her hands, including “colorful stained-glass windows, mobiles out of different materials, unique patchwork which you created with great patience… The quilts which survived will cover babies yet to be born.”\nA eulogy read at her funeral in the name of her son-in-law, Jehan Berman, stated, “Rivka, the waves you left behind you are wide and powerful, more than a mother-in-law, you were like a mother to me and a grandmother, with a big heart like the entire Jewish people.”\n“I was the new lone soldier on the scene in Nir Oz, and you accepted me with a big and loving heart,” he said. “And the rest is a unique family story, full of emotion, drama, celebrations, love and compassion… You will stay forever in our hearts, and your legacy is eternal.”\nA post from Nir Oz noted that Yossi came to the kibbutz as a young man, and returned in his later years to settle there again: “His image still appears before our eyes, walking back and forth, restless, across the dining room floor, a cigarette in the corner of his mouth — and he is ready to drive, to help, to provide service to someone. He is fully committed to one goal — to give personal service, sensitive and caring service to each and every person, through the love of his life — the steering wheel.”\nAt his funeral, his daughter, Dorit, recalled that her father had given each of their siblings unique nicknames, “which described us perfectly. You always told us that there were three most important things: don’t steal; don’t do drugs; and that we must always take care of each other as siblings.”\n“Dad, I believe that we will continue in your path, to be good people, to believe in the State of Israel, to fall, to get up and to keep moving,” she said. “We are sure that you are raising a glass of chocolate liquor to our future.

At 6:37 a.m., he posted on Facebook one word: “khalas” — Hebrew-Arabic slang for stop, or enough.\nShortly afterward he called his mother and told her that he had been shot.\n“He told me he loved me, and then he said, ‘Sorry, sorry, sorry’… He said he would always protect us, he said the [foundational prayer] Shema Yisrael,” his mother, Livnat Regev-Levi recounted in an interview. She stayed on the phone with him for 38 minutes before she disconnected to call the police, who didn’t answer. When she called Naor back, he didn’t answer either.\nSix days later, his body was found and his family was informed that he had been killed. He is survived by his parents, Livnat and Avi, and his two older siblings, Stav and Adar. He was buried on October 13 in Petah Tikva.\nHe was remembered by his family and friends as living and breathing music and as a huge fan of the Hapoel Tel Aviv soccer club.\n“Naor really loved his music and his freedom — it was the most important thing to him in life,” Livnat told a local news outlet. “He was a very funny guy, a wise prankster, with eyes that feel and see everything.” She recounted that he didn’t fit in well in traditional schooling before he was diagnosed with ADHD and found a new school that paid attention to his needs.\n“Together they understood that he was drawn to music, which also gave him a rhythm,” Livat said. During and after his army service, she said, he began to explore music more seriously, and “slowly, Naor became a professional in the art of recording and built a name for himself. He specialized in trance music in the 80s style, which appeals to an older audience… and he had made a name for himself around the world, recording in Portugal and Spain.”\nHis friend Daniela Gandi, who fled the party with him and was seriously wounded, wrote on his Facebook wall a month after he was killed: “I’m sure that you can hear me talking to you all the time. I miss our silly conversations, messages about music and new tracks that you found me or that I found. Sometimes I see you signed on and I immediately start to cry. Have a good week, my heroic friend. Cheers to the laughs I had with you. Thank you for life. It’s all because of you.”\n“My beloved little brother,” his brother Adar wrote on Facebook. “Naori, I never even imagined how much I would miss you.”\nHis mother noted that his funeral was full of music, as well as red Hapoel t-shirts, and “I put candy on his grave, like he loved, instead of stones… We sang by his grave and we played trance music.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Apparently, the money he got on base he would give to lone soldiers so they would have food and whatever else they needed.”\nAt a ceremony marking 30 days since his funeral, his family and friends donned shirts with what they said was his motto: “Smile, because a smile is joy, and joy is the strength to go on.”\nAs a teenager, he played soccer with the Ironi Ashdod team until he started his army service.\nHis cousin, Almog Shalev, wrote on Facebook that “we are cousins but practically brothers, our connection was as close as possible.” He noted that Ilay had a keen love of soccer, and from now “you’ll watch anyway from the best seats there are.” Almog wrote that Ilay was about to turn 21 and was slated to complete his mandatory army service in 8 months: “You told me, ‘Almog, don’t worry, I’ll be released and I’ll travel like you.'”\nOn his birthday, two weeks after he was killed, his father Shmuel wrote on Facebook, “I don’t know what to write to you today, it’s your birthday and I’m looking for you in your room to wish you mazel tov, and you’re not there.

    "story": "Ori Tchernichovsky, 29, from Petah Tikva, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nTchernichovsky, who was studying electrical engineering at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, was working at the party as a bartender to help finance his fourth and final year of studies. He arrived at the festival around 2 a.m. that Saturday, while his family thought he was safe and at home.\nAt the event, he met up with his long-time friend Noa Argamani, 26, who was attending with her boyfriend, Avinatan Or, 30, and other of their university friends to dance into the night. Argamani and her partner Or were later taken hostage by the attackers – a video of their abduction was one of the first to be published online by the terrorists.\nAt 7:18 a.m., Noa sent Ori her location, and at 8:12 she asked him if there was a hiding place near him or if she should stay in the car. The last phone call between them was at 8:33, according to Ori’s cellphone, which was found near the festival stage and handed over to his mother, Sigalit Hillel, three days after the massacre.\n“God willing, when [Noa] will be released I will ask her what they spoke about in those last calls of his life,” Sigalit told Ynet.\nHis mother said that on the day of the attack, she assumed he was home in Beersheba, and he messaged her around 7 a.m. saying that he was fine and sheltering. She tried to call him later but he never picked up. His family only learned from Instagram that he had been at the festival.\nHis mother said they later found out that he had been shot dead while in a car around 9 a.m: “They didn’t let me see the body,” she told Ynet. “I understand he had been shot in the head while he was in the car. Even if he was covered [with a sheet] I caressed, hugged, and kissed him,” she said. “I felt his beard. I saw his shoes that were still on him.”\nA yeshiva graduate, Ori served in the Israeli Air Force Intelligence Unit and after his army service traveled to Australia and New Zealand, returning to Israel for his university studies.\nOri, who was buried in Petah Tikva, is survived by his parents, Sigalit and Shai, his brother Hadi, sister Hila and brother-in-law Snir.\n“I’m sorry I didn’t give you a last hug Ori,” his elder sister Hila said at the funeral, according to a local news site. “Sorry I wasn’t there with you during the horrible moments you went through at the party. You and I were a winning team, we always got through everything together hand in hand. You always made sure I wouldn’t be alone.\n“I’m sorry that you were there alone and that I wasn’t with you to think together about where to go and how to escape, that I didn’t hold your hand and direct you to a hiding place that would take care of you for me,” she continued. “I’m sorry I didn’t take care of you the way you always took care of me. That this time I was not able to make sure you returned home.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Ofir Shoshani, 20, a commander at the Mifrasit Base in the Intelligence Corps, was slain inside her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7 by Hamas terrorists.\nShe is survived by her parents, Mira and Shai, and her brothers Omri and Amit. She was buried on October 15 in the Beersheba military cemetery.\nHer brother Omri told Ynet that Ofir was in her apartment in the kibbutz’s youth section when Hamas terrorists invaded. He said she was on the phone with her parents “when they heard terrorists enter her apartment and shoot her.” She told them she had been shot in the arm and her father got his weapon and drove toward her apartment, as terrorists repeatedly opened fire on him as he drove.\nOmri said that his father continued to dodge gunfire, and as he approached he saw many members of the kibbutz’s local security team dead on the ground, and took one of their weapons. He tried again to head to her apartment but was shot in the arm, and forced to crawl away and hide for hours until he was rescued. By the time he got to Ofir’s apartment, it was too late, and they found her dead in her bed.\n“My sister was the most beautiful girl in the world,” Omri said. “She always smiled and affected everyone around her. We were friends, but not the way I wanted.”\nShoshani was close friends with Yam Goldstein, who was slain alongside her father on October 7 while the rest of her family was taken hostage. Their friends from high school got tattoos of two fairies to immortalize the two young women, who dressed up together as Tinkerbell on Purim in 10th grade.\nTheir friend Gaya told Ynet that “Yam and Ofir were the heart of our class, two girls with common sense. If I needed to know what to do, how to do it, where to go, they directed me. Ofir would always laugh that she could never get rid of Yam, they were the best of friends… Now Ofir is probably telling Yam: ‘What, you followed me here too?'”\nLiat Eti Peretz wrote on Instagram that Ofir was a “beautiful and perfect girl with a captivating smile who I was privileged to know. At every meeting with Ofir, I was blown away by her intelligence. I always said that we would be hearing much more about this girl.”\nHer grandmother, Jenny Hampel, wrote on Facebook that this “horrendous war took from me my oldest and most dear granddaughter. I have no idea how to be comforted. A 20-year-old bud that never had the time to develop into a flower. I love you so much, my heart is burning.”\nOmri noted that he too got a tattoo in memory of his sister — a dancing woman that she had tattooed on her as well — to which he added wings and a halo: “It was clear to me that I would get this tattoo, that something of her would stay with me,” he said. “If she heard that, she would laugh at me and say I was copying her.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

On October 9, when Zlata and Itai were still considered missing, her sister Bela described speaking to the police and ZAKA in an effort to get information on Zlata. Bela said none of the first responders she spoke to knew about the party, which was much smaller than the nearby Supernova Festival in Re’im and was held without permits or police knowledge.\n“They don’t realize that there was another party [in the western Negev] they are in shock every time we tell them. They can’t understand that there was another place, another party,” she said.\nOnline, friends and loved ones described Zlata as a constant source of joy and comfort to all those around her. They recalled a talented, generous young woman who loved art and working with children and giving of herself. On her Facebook page, her love of rescue dogs — especially pit bulls — is clear as day.\nIn a Twitter thread sharing memories sent by loved ones, reporter Josh Breiner of Haaretz wrote that from a young age Zlata worked in education and always found ways to volunteer. She trained children in martial arts and worked as an educator in the army. At her most recent job she also helped negotiate better working conditions for her and her colleagues.\nLoved ones told Breiner that Zlata was the type of person who all of her friends considered their best friend.\nZlata was a graduate of the Kibbutzim College of Education, Technology and the Arts, where she earned a degree in business management.\nOn an online memorial page, a close friend and coworker named Nitzan wrote, “Every shift with you was so much better. Your amazing smile, the hugs and the laughter. Thank you for being there for me when I needed it. I just don’t have the words to describe what an amazing person you were.”\nOn Facebook, Zlata’s mother Galina Kosovsky posted a picture of her daughter as a young child looking into the camera.\nIn the caption she wrote: “‘Mom, I woke up, come give me a kiss.’ This is how little Zlata would begin every day. I want to talk about her to no end. Where can I find the colors that would capture her beautiful green eyes? How can I describe her charming and beautiful smile? What music could convey your magical laugh? How can I convey the power of your hugs, which gave me the energy to live? I cry for her, I cry for myself and I cry for all of the world that lost one of its most fantastic colors. Rest my girl, rest my joy.

He was born in France and in 1992 made aliya as a child with his family.\nOn the morning of October 7, when thousands of Hamas terrorists streamed into Israel from Gaza and massacred some 1,200 Israelis and took a further 253 captive, Chicheportiche was in his home in the small southern Israeli town of Shlomit.\nAs rockets rained down overhead, the members of Shlomit’s security team quickly became aware that a group of around 10 terrorists had entered the neighboring town of Pri Gan and the local security team was severely overpowered.\nAccording to his fellow security team members, who spoke to Israel’s Channel 13 in a November 1 interview, Chicheportiche was in the second group of Shlomit security officers to join the fray in Pri Gan.\nAt that point, the Hamas terrorists had already broken into four homes with the intent to murder those living inside.\n“We got to Pri-Gan, and at a certain point we realized they had opened fire on us,” Yehuda Rabinovich, who arrived in the same group as Chicheportiche, told Channel 13. “We realized the situation was dire.”\nSoon, two more members of the Shlomit security team arrived. They joined the fierce battle, against terrorists armed with Kalashnikovs and grenades, and quickly overpowered Chicheportiche’s crew.\n“Aviad and I got close [to the battle], and we see Reouven right away,” Shlomit security team member Oz Glick told Channel 13. “‘Come!’ he roared at us, ‘There are terrorists here, we have wounded, run!’ Screaming, roaring. And you understand, if he’s roaring, you need to run.”\nSoon after, Reouven and his close friend Aviad were both fatally shot by Hamas terrorists. The few members of the team who were not killed or wounded continued fighting, calling desperately for IDF military support that never came.\nAfter some time, the terrorists fled the scene, realizing that it would not be a simple operation to overtake Pri Gan. Only once they had left did IDF soldiers arrive.\nThe team successfully saved Pri Gan from being the site of another October 7 massacre, but they lost four of their members including Chicheportiche, and another four were wounded.\nChicheportiche is remembered as a hero by his family and community, who told Channel 13 that it brought them a measure of comfort to know that Reouven’s sacrifice saved the entire town of Pri Gan as well as the surrounding towns, as the terrorists did not continue their rampage after fleeing.\nOz Shoshan, a fellow member of the Shlomit security team, said that Chicheportiche “was a person that, at any given time you could call him up and say, ‘Reouven, I’m stuck on something…’ and he would answer, ‘Okay, I’m on my way.'”\n“Reouven is [all] heart ” Benny Meshulem, IDF security coordinator for Shlomit security team, told Channel 13. “He was the heart of the yishuv. He would always talk about the State of Israel, how much he loved the land, how much he loved everything here.”\n“It was obvious that if something happened, he couldn’t possibly stay behind. That’s not Reouven,” said Meshulem.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Tami Suchman, 76, was murdered on October 7 by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Be’eri.\nOn the morning of October 7, Suchman went into her safe room and started calling family members. Her son Ben told her to hold the door handle closed so that no one could get in. She held the door handle with all of her might but eventually had to sit down to rest. When the Hamas terrorists finally entered the safe room, Ben was on the phone and heard the gunmen take his mother away. Initially, the family thought she was kidnapped and held out hope. She was found dead 10 days later.\nSuchman was born on Kibbutz Kedma in 1947, the eldest child of Abba and Leah Barmak. Her parents were among the founders of Kedma, which was part of the 11 points in the Negev campaign in 1946.\nA eulogy written on the Kibbutz Be’eri website stated that after her mother died when she was five years old, Tami raised her brother Udi “like a mother.” Their father later remarried and had three more children, and after Kibbutz Kedma was abandoned in 1962, the blended family moved to Be’eri.\nWhen she was 20 years old, Tami married Tzvi Suchman in a joint wedding with another couple at Kibbutz Be’eri. The Suchmans would eventually have four children, including Ben, today the head of the famed Be’eri printing house.\nThe kibbutz wrote that Suchman was known for her keen fashion sense, and for always being able to spot the next hot thing. Her neighbors on Be’eri were used to seeing Suchman return from Tel Aviv with new jewelry and clothes and in no time, whatever she was wearing would catch on across the kibbutz.\nHer fashion sense was in keeping with her artistic spirit. She studied at the Shenkar College of Engineering, Design and Art in Ramat Gan in her younger days before returning to the kibbutz to teach all types of crafts from sewing to carpentry. She also made her own gold and silver jewelry and studied alternative medicine. She provided shiatsu, acupuncture and Tui na treatments with great care and kindness.\nThe kibbutz wrote that in 1986 Suchman was appointed manager of the Be’eri sewing workshop and through her hard work and boundless energy, turned it into a full-fledged factory. She ran the factory for almost 30 years, including after she retired and became a pensioner.\nSuchman had 12 grandchildren. Her house — full of artwork and flowers — was always the spot for family meetups. During the pandemic, she turned the house into a cafe of sorts for locals thirsty for a place to unwind.\nThe kibbutz wrote that she was also close to a Gazan man named Khaled who used to work as a builder on Be’eri before the First intifada, and raised money from her neighbors to send to Khaled and his family after his work permit was rescinded.\nHer daughter, Ela Beirav wrote on Facebook of the helplessness of her mother on October 7 and her regret at not being able to help her.\n“Mom, today we were supposed to celebrate your birthday, but instead we are eulogizing you, again. It has already been more than 100 days since the inhuman Hamas-ISIS took you from your house and murdered you, more than 100 days since the state and the government and the person who leads it abandoned you,” she wrote.\nShe added: “Mom, I’m sorry that I couldn’t save you or at least find a hero that could.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Gunmen in a passing car opened fire on the vehicle and as Naama and her friends in the backseat ducked down to dodge the gunfire, a single bullet pierced the trunk and the backseat, hitting Naama in the back, her mother said.\nYnet reported that less than a year ago, Mualem was certified as an attorney and opened her very own practice in Rishon Lezion. That shouldn’t have come as a surprise to anyone — at her funeral, her mother said that Naama “grew up in a family of attorneys and it was natural for her to continue on that path. She loved it and she had a talent for it.”\nRachel added that “she was a girl with a well-developed sense of humor. She loved life and was surrounded by friends. I spoke to her for the last time on Friday evening, and my husband spoke to her at 6:46 in the morning [on October 7]. She said, ‘Dad, they’re shooting at us, we’re leaving for Rishon.’ And he told her, ‘Drive safely.’”\nRachel said that in her bedroom, Naama had pasted inspirational quotes on the walls, including “Devour life in big bites, because life is now.”\nA high school teacher of hers wrote online: “Naama the beautiful and brilliant. My beloved student. Even with all of your assertiveness and intelligence, you were so humble. You were loved by all of your friends and you always fought for justice for all. It was obvious that you would study law. You were destined for a glorious career in the halls of justice.”\nHer friend Gal spoke of a nightly ritual at Naama’s apartment, where they would sit in the living room “talking about life, watching movies with tons of popcorn, arranging socks and wondering where all the other socks in the drawer disappear to.”\nShe added that “you were an illuminating light. You always knew to say exactly the right words, to hug, to counsel, to strengthen me and support me in every step I took. You always knew how to adapt yourself to every person and situation and you caused every person to love you.”\nHer bother Raz said that while Naama did not leave behind a will, “what we must do now is to continue to spread the light that she cast all around her, for her family, her friends, and everyone who needs that light during these days.”\nIn an Instagram post dedicated to Naama’s memory, she can be seen with her friend Tzlil, dancing at parties, drinking wine at a picnic, and goofing off with a rolling suitcase at the airport in that way people do on the way to a departing flight to parts unknown.\nHer friend wrote of the hours and hours they spent talking on the phone, and how Naama was always — always — there for her.\n“We have so many stories and in all of them — we took care of one another. How could it be that I wasn’t there to protect you at the party? Probably there’s a better party somewhere up there and you… are doing what’s best for you.

He was buried October 12 in Kfar Tavor.\nDor was related to Labor MK Naama Lazimi, who shared on X the story of his bravery that day: “The moment that the terrorists arrived, Dor shouted loudly so that everyone would hear, and fought against [Hamas] along with his comrades at the entrance to the base with all his might, allowing around 20 soldiers to get quickly to the shelter, saving their lives.”\nThe Knesset member said that “Dor and those who were with him succeeded in killing many terrorists in a heroic battle,” noting that his family received details of his final moments from a soldier who was saved due to his warnings, and visited the shiva mourning house to tell them.\nFamily and friends noted his love for music, including playing the guitar. Dor was an former volunteer counselor with the “Krembo Wings” organization, which assists children with special needs; the organization described him as a “well-loved and handsome boy, who formed friendships and shared responsibility with others, and was an important part of the local chapter.”\nHis cousin Karen Lazimi described him as a “a boy, a man, a fighter, and now an angel. How did we lose you? How?! This pain is unbearable. We know that you fought heroically until your final moments against indescribable evil. Dor, now we can only promise you that we will continue to watch over what you fought for, watch over your family, watch over the State of Israel and continue in your path always.”\nHis close friend, Yarin Arzuan, wrote that “calling you my best friend would not be right, because we were brothers… I’ll miss our conversations, chilling, the inside jokes we had that made us pee our pants, the sleepless nights because of your snoring, sitting with you with a cigarette and talking about life.\n“With all the sadness and the pain I mostly wanted to tell you thanks,” he added. “Thanks for all the good times and the less good times we experienced; thanks for giving me a different perspective on life; thanks for knowing how to listen to me on everything and how to lift me up from any situation we were in.”\nDor’s father, David Lazimi, wrote on Facebook as he marked his own birthday that “every year Dor would surprise me with a message that would always make me cry, about our friendship and about life in general. He would look forward so much to this day just to send me a [birthday] blessing.\n“So my Dor, even without your message — which I am so much waiting for but will not come — I know that you are up above blessing me now and watching over me,” he added. “I miss you so much, it will never be the same again Dori.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He is survived by his daughter Ori and sons Nitzan and Avner, as well as several grandchildren.\nOrgad was a volunteer with the Road to Recovery organization, through which he picked up Palestinian patients at border crossings with Gaza and drove them to and from Israeli hospitals for treatments.\nRivka Neria-Ben Shahar, a professor at Sapir College in Sderot, wrote in Ynet that Orgad used to audit her classes there despite not being a student.\n“An unusually curious person, he came regularly to my classes on the Haredi community in Israel, and shared his opinions and knowledge with the students,” she wrote. Neria-Ben Shahar said she didn’t know his name at the time, and thought of him simply as “the old man,” who “accompanied me always outside after class… speaking to me next to the cold water cooler, walking me to my next class. He had suggestions on how to improve the situation, insights on how to recruit Haredim to the IDF, or how better to divide the state budget.”\nAriel Picard wrote on Facebook that he taught Orgad more than 20 years ago, and would regularly spot him at conferences and gatherings over the decades: “Eli was a true intellectual who looked for a path his whole life. I met him from time to time at Hartman Institute lectures and different conferences throughout the country. Eli was always there with youthful enthusiasm, grace and unusual wisdom.”\nEducator Shmulik Faust said he would always encounter Orgad at gatherings he led of joint secular-religious study groups around Israel: “There wasn’t one meeting or lecture over decades at which I did not see the face of Eli — always with a thin smile. A quiet presence, smiling, eternal, a phenomenon.”\nEli’s son, Avner, wrote on Facebook that “our father had an incredible thirst for knowledge and endless curiousity.”\n“In recent years, he was very interested in Judaism and took part in joint learning intiatives,” Avner added. “He believed in our common denominator, and always said that despite the disagreements, we have a shared destiny here. He was prepared to travel anywhere to meet people who thought differently than him, and he always returned to Kibbutz Kfar Aza, the place he loved so much, the best place in the world.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She called her friend who was also fleeing and told her to avoid that area, saving her life, he said.\nEldad said Gili kept texting the family until around 9:15 a.m., telling them that she was hiding near the partygrounds, as gunshots closed in around them. Not long after, she stopped answering.\nHe said he immediately headed south toward the Gaza border to search for her, bypassing police barricades and even embedding with army convoys but was unable to find her. Three days later, the family was informed that her body had been found.\nShe was buried on October 11 near Modiin. She is survived by her parents, Orna and Eldad, and her older sister, Adi.\nHer parents told La’Isha magazine that Gili, a longtime scout leader, spent a year volunteering for national service, working during the day with children with special needs, and in the evening meeting with young American Jews to instill them with Zionist pride.\nShe served in the IDF as an artillery instructor, and after her release she set off on a big trip to South America, returning in May 2023. She started working through the scouts as an aide to lone soldiers coming from abroad to ease them through the enlistment process.\nHer parents described her to La’Isha as “a girl of happiness and laughter, joy for life incarnate! Someone eulogized her and said, ‘She wasn’t a ray of light, she was the sun!'”\nhttps://twitter.com/AdamAlbilya/status/1712417915851379095\nFor years she worked and volunteered with the scouts, including leading their delegations overseas. Gili spent a summer in 2017 working as a counselor at Camp Ben Frankel, a sleepaway Jewish summer camp in Makanda, Illinois, as a delegate from the scouts’ movement and also worked in 2019 and 2022 at Camp Tel Yehudah, a Jewish summer camp in New York.\nThe director of Camp Ben Frankel, Aaron Hadley, told a local news site that “she was there with messages of peace and happiness and was a real ray of light.”\n“She was a source of joy and humor, clever, and she cared. She was someone who wanted to make the world a better place by volunteering and working with kids, and that’s about as noble as it comes in my book,” Hadley said.\nHer friend Shira Samorai, who attended the rave with Gili and managed to escape, wrote on Facebook that “anyone who ever met Gili knows what we’re talking about, and those who did not — wow you missed out, oh how you missed out.”\n“Many words can be said about this beautiful sunshine, but you can’t really understand what an incredible girl she was, the most beautiful soul, the rarest breed, a well of endless energy, a smile monster, an evil genius and somehow a role model of such values.”\nHer father told La’Isha, “We always knew Gili was what people call ‘the salt of the earth.’ But during the shiva [mourning period] for her, we learned more and more. It’s so sad that the enormous potential of a perfect girl like her went down the drain. It’s a huge loss for the family, for Israeli society and for humanity.”\nHer mother Orna told the Kan public radio station that since her death, “We have received from all around the world [news of] all sorts of initiatives and memorials to Gili and evenings held in her memory.”\n“People really love happy people, and people who are fun to be with, and who lift you up — Gili was a truly, truly happy person,” Orna recounted. “She was always happy and always merry and always uplifting, always with her contagious laughter — a loved and loving person.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

They later found out that she had run from the shelter to her room on base, encountering and killing a terrorist along the way, and then was killed near her room by another terrorist who had infiltrated the outpost.\nShe is survived by her parents, Ori and Asaf, and her siblings Liad and Aviya. She was buried in Ashdod on October 12.\nA dedicated volunteer with the Magen David Adom emergency service, her family said that she dreamed of studying to become a doctor after she completed her mandatory army service. Shir’s parents chose to memorialize her by purchasing an MDA ambulance in her honor.\n“Shir was a MDA volunteer for five years, even before she was a paramedic in the army, she contributed so much at MDA, even on weekends when she would come home [from the army] she would first set a MDA shift, to save lives, and only afterward prioritize anything else,” her mother, Ori told Army Radio.\n“We chose to commemorate her and continue her path and her spirit by buying an ambulance which will continue to save lives, and will continue to be for others, and to try just a little bit to continue what she dreamed of,” Ori added.\nOri told a local Ashdod news site that Shir was very happy with the path of her army service: “In all the photos of her you can see a really joyous girl, who is happy and enjoying herself, she was very happy.”\n“Shir was a girl of home and family, always helpful, supportive, a gentle girl, very pleasant and never angry,” Ori added. “She was very sociable, she had many circles of friends, from school, the army, the gym, and of course MDA.”\nHer brother Liad told the news site that his sister “wanted to dedicate her life to helping and caring for others, that was her love.” He noted that she also loved to work out at the gym as well as to dance, which she regularly studied.\n“She had a lot of dualities,” Liad said. “On the one hand she was very smart and gentle, and on the other hand she was very social, accepted, and no small fighter.”\nHer father Asaf told the news site that Shir was committed to becoming a doctor despite the challenging path of doing so in Israel.\n“We talked about it a lot, that being a doctor in Israel is not the rosiest future, but she was single-minded about it and directed everything toward it — her endless devotion to her studies with high grades and successful matriculation exams,” he said.\nShir “was very quiet, modest and she had very high expectations from herself,” her father added. “That was evident in every area of life she applied herself to: She was no sucker, she knew to stand up for herself, and never gave up.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

My beautiful souls, I miss you.”\n“I am thirsty for your touch, for the sounds of your voices, for your beautiful smiles,” he added later. “My heart has an enormous hole forever.

    "story": "Chief Warrant Officer Ido “Crido” Rosenthal, 45, from Ben Shemen, was killed in a battle against Hamas terrorists in the area between Kibbutz Be’eri and Kibbutz Alumim on October 7.\nHe is survived by his wife and three children along with his parents and his two sisters.\nRosenthal was a member of the Air Force’s elite Shaldag Unit, where he served as a non-commissioned officer while taking periodic breaks to study, travel, and raise a family.\nOn the morning of October 7, when he heard about the massacre occurring on the Gaza border, Rosenthal grabbed his gun and rushed to meet up with his unit. They boarded a helicopter headed south toward Kibbutz Be’eri.\nThe helicopter dropped them off a short distance away from the epicenters of battle, and they approached Be’eri in a military vehicle. It was during this approach, according to a Globes report, that Rosenthal’s unit encountered a large group of Hamas terrorists headed toward nearby Kibbutz Alumim and decided to engage them. They killed at least ten of the terrorists but took heavy losses themselves.\nDuring battle, one of his fellow soldiers was shot in the hand and the chest. Rosenthal checked out the soldier’s wounds and sent him away from the front lines to hide in their vehicle. The soldier said he then heard another volley of bullets and turned to see Rosenthal killed on the spot, shot through the neck.\nThe team retreated after that, and the battle continued with the help of IDF drones and a combat helicopter, eventually killing all of the terrorists. This battle, according to Globes, saved Kibbutz Alumim from an even worse fate than the one that ultimately befell it — 19 foreign workers were killed and five were abducted. \nFile: Security forces seen next to burnt cars near the entrance to Kibbutz Alumim, near the Israeli-Gaza border, southern Israel, October 9, 2023. (Yossi Zamir/Flash90)\nRosenthal’s friends called him “Crido,” according to Globes. This name came from his grandmother, who called him “Querido” in Spanish, meaning “dear,” and morphed into an army nickname that was short for “Crazy Ido.”\nHis peers explained that Rosenthal’s final battle was not the first time he had saved lives. One of them told Globes about a day when, on the way back from a tough training session, Rosenthal and his crew were stopped at an intersection when they saw a van full of people drive directly into a wall at full speed.\nRosenthal jumped into action, tearing off the door of the van “like one of the heroes in X-Men” so the soldiers could access the passengers.  Some had been killed instantly, but the team was able to save several people who were trapped in the vehicle, with “Crido” leading the charge.\nIn his civilian life, Rosenthal was a skilled photographer, his wife Noga Friedman told culture magazine Portfolio in early January.\n“We met when we were students in Jerusalem,” Friedman, currently a sociology doctoral student at Ben-Gurion University, said. “Around age 30, he decided to take his love for photography, which he developed while traveling the world, and study [it].”\nHe enrolled in the Hadassah Academic College for a degree in Photographic Communications. “Everyone who studied with him admired him,” said Friedman. “Even from other departments. He didn’t talk much, but his words carried weight.”\nWhen he finished his studies, Rosenthal returned to Shaldag, but kept his camera with him.\n“Through his photography… you could see his perspective, full of love and humanity within his multifacetedness,” said Friedman. “He allowed the viewer to be tender, to be interested in the [subject], to look at them with compassion. I think most of his photographs came from a place of wanting to show [humanity], even in military service.”\n“Maybe,” she added, “he wanted to emphasize that he himself was a well-rounded person.”\nOn a private Facebook post which Friedman agreed to have translated and shared on the Israel Story podcast in early November, the widow mourned the loss of her most intimate and loving relationship. “It’s impossibly hard that everything that was private, everything that belonged just to the two of us, is now something I need to bear by myself.”\nThe deputy commander of his unit, who was with Rosenthal during his last battle, told Globes: “This man took untold military secrets with him to the grave. There is no way to describe his contribution to the security of the State of Israel.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Samar Fouad Talalka, 24, was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists from Kibbutz Nir Am on October 7 and taken hostage in Gaza.\nOn December 15, IDF troops operating in Gaza mistook him and two other hostages for terrorists and opened fire, killing all three.\nTalalka, who was working the weekend shift at the kibbutz’s hatchery at the time of the Hamas onslaught, hailed from the Bedouin town of Hura. He is survived by his father, Fouad, who also worked on the kibbutz, and his mother, Leila, who is a teacher, as well as his nine younger siblings.\nHe was described as a motorcyle lover who was slated to get married and build his own family soon.\n“I’m devastated to receive him lifeless,” his father Fouad told Ynet. “We were waiting for him to fulfill all his dreams. His death broke me… We sat for days in fear and waited to hear his voice until the day we were informed that he had been killed.”\nHis father told The New York Times that Samar was “beloved by everyone,” adding: “He wasn’t just my son, he was my friend. He didn’t hide things from me, and any problems he had, he would come to me for us to talk about them.”\nWahid Ahoziil, a local organizer from the Bedouin city of Rahat, said after the kidnapping that Samar is “a great guy… he wants to make an honest living.”\nHis cousin, Alaa Talalka, told Channel 14 news that Samar was a “nice guy, sociable, with a sense of humor — a guy who was always fun to sit with, to hang out with, just to be around.”\nAlaa said they heard from freed hostages that Samar “served as a translator between the kidnappers and the Israeli hostages, and this really characterized him, because he always tried to help others, always tried to share affection and spread friendliness… He was so close to freedom. He was so close to getting out of there.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was buried on October 11 in the military section of the Kfar Etzion cemetery.\nSaadon spent time as a camper and counselor at Camp Moshava IO in Pennsylvania, as his grandfather was the camp’s longtime assistant director and his parents regularly worked there.\nThe camp’s director, Alan Silverman, told a local news outlet that “Hallel was in a bunker guarding along the fence in the south where the terrorists broke through,” adding that “three of the soldiers including Hallel were killed as they tried to prevent them from crossing in, but there was a huge number of them.”\nAt a ceremony held at a horse ranch in Israel, which staged a competition in his honor, his mother Devora said, “Hallel was a guy with a heart of gold. He would help everyone without making a thing of it and without expecting anything in return.”\n“Also during battle on Simhat Torah [on October 7], he fell as he was protecting his comrades,” she said. “He was a cowboy in his heart, deeply connected to horses, to animals and to nature,” she said, noting how much he loved the ranch and taking part in its competitions, including overseas.\n“We feel that even though he’s not physically with us, his life has remained here and our job is to spread his light, along with the light that exists in each one of us,” she said. “Like Hallel, you should take advantage of your time, achieve your dreams, and invest in the things you love.”\nAt a memorial marking 30 days since his death, his great-grandmother Chana said, “I asked him, ‘Isn’t the [army] training difficult?’ and he said, ‘It’s not hard, it’s all good.’ That was this boy.”\nDescribing their conversations, Chana said that they would speak about “the fact that we’re an ancient nation, we started with Avraham our forefather, and we’re continuing forever. ‘The glory of Israel does not lie!’ We always spoke about the importance of every part [of the nation] being strong. That everyone will be connected to what came before and what came after. It was very important to Hallel,” she said.\n“Hallel, in his own way, all of the time, until the end, always was perfect, always with emotion, always with dedication, to take upon himself a huge task — he protected the people, he protected the land,” Chana continued. “We remember him and we are proud of him.

He planned to meet his friend, Noa Yifrach, when he got there, but the two didn’t connect before Hamas began its brutal attack on the partygoers.\nYifrach called Abergel in the early morning, as soon as she heard shooting.\n“He answered me straight away and calmed me down,” Yifrach said to Channel 12 news. “He’s from the south and I’m from the north, and I reacted to the incident differently from him.”\n“He was very practical. He told me, ‘Noa, the party is shutting down. Go calmly to pack up your things,'” she said.\nThe pair continued to text throughout the attack, keeping track of each other’s whereabouts until Abergel stopped responding while he hid under the music festival stage.\n“I made dozens of calls to Oded that remained unanswered,” Yifrach said. “At the same time, a van was already picking us up, along with dozens of other survivors, towards Patish, to the community center where I collapsed. I saw all the wounded arrive there, full of blood, and I understand the magnitude of the event — and Oded still wasn’t answering.”\nThe next person to come across Abergel found him lifeless under the stage. May Hayat, 30, who sought cover in the same hiding place, saw his body. Next to him was his phone, ringing with a call from Yifrach.\nHayat took some of the blood from his body and smeared it across her face, playing dead. She lay there for two hours as his phone continued to ring.\n“I was terribly afraid. But the whole time I looked at Oded, who had a small smile, which gave me a lot of hope and strength,” Hayat recalled.\nUntil Yifrach stumbled upon Hayat’s testimony of October 7 on social media, she and the Abergel family clung to the hope that Oded might still be alive.\n“I sent her [Hayat] pictures of Oded, and she identified him unequivocally and left no room for doubt,” said Yifrach. “‘That’s him, I’ll never forget his face,’ she told me.”\nThe Shafir Regional Council website’s tribute to Abergel describes him as “a special person with endless giving, who loved life and knew how to live it.”\nBorn to Yisca and Asher Abergel, Oded grew up in Merkaz Shapira under the Shafir Regional Council. He was the youngest of seven siblings: Itamar, Nadav, Neta, Naama, Nitai and Liel.\n“Even at the time [of the massacre] we know that he guided his friends to save them from hell. Even in his death, he helped a girl he didn’t know. Oded died a hero,” wrote his sister Naama Cohen.\nAbergel’s funeral was held in Masu’ot Yitzhak on October 15.\n“We will always remember you for your amazing smile and happy heart,” wrote Oded’s brother Nadav on Facebook.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Kama was related to former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir; Shayna Korngold, Meir’s older sister, was Kama’s great-great-grandmother.\nOn the morning of October 7, Kama was in Tel Aviv, staying with friends from his unit, when he was rushed down to the Gaza border to fend off the onslaught of Hamas terrorists. He fought in battle alongside his peers and was one of four members of his unit to die in Kfar Aza on the first day of the war.\nRaised in Givat Shapira, Kama was a member of the “Five Fingers” youth movement, known for fostering leadership through physical activity and producing graduates who become IDF commanders. He drafted directly into Sayeret Matkal and was in his final year of army service when he was killed.\nKama’s death was not confirmed until October 9, and he was buried on October 11 in Moshav Herut.\nIn a eulogy posted to Facebook, his uncle, David Yasinski-Aloni, described Kama as a “noble boy.” Not in the aristocratic sense, he clarified, but a “barefoot noble boy, or with Naot shoes and perhaps a tank top.”\nKama was a loving son and brother, from helping his father build a gazebo in their yard, to assembling an ice bath for his sisters and planting a mango tree in front of it.\n“A humble noble boy, which is the rarest [combination]… It is so [natural] that you would run between whistling bullets and explosions to save people crying out for help in their houses,” his uncle said.\n“Hadari, you loved life,” Kama’s mother Gila Yasinski-Kama wrote in her eulogy which she also posted on Facebook. “You ended it with all your strength and courage.”\n“You said goodbye to me with words I did not often hear you say.

Brother Nadav Popplewell, 51, was killed while in Hamas captivity, according to a June 3, 2024, statement by the IDF. His body was recovered by the military on August 20, 2024.\nAll three siblings were born and raised in Nirim and hold dual British-Israeli citizenship from their late father, Rafi Popplewell.\nNadav and Channah were taken hostage on October 7 from their adjacent homes on the kibbutz. While Channah was released on November 24 as part of a temporary ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel, Nadav remained in captivity. The two were together throughout the length of Channah’s captivity, held in a tunnel under Gaza. Nadav was seen in a Hamas propaganda video released in May, apparently weeks after his death, according to the IDF.\nHaving only heard of Roi’s death upon her release, one of the first things Channah did after her return to Israel was visit her son’s grave.\nSister Svatitzky, who was the only living member of her immediate family to avoid the Hamas attacks on October 7, has chosen not to learn about the minute details of her brother’s death.\n“I only know that they found him shot,” she told Haaretz in late October, a few days before the funeral, “and I didn’t ask for more details. It’s not relevant to me. I don’t need pictures in my head, nor do I watch all the Hamas video clips [of the massacre] that are being posted now. I can’t let anything in that might cause me to go into shock, to affect my functioning. I’m on a mission at the moment. I can’t do anything about my slain brother… At least I know – that’s more than others have. Not knowing is worse than my situation.”\nPopplewell was buried on Kibbutz Yagur, where his sister lives, on October 27. The family intends to re-bury him beside his father in Kibbutz Nirim once it is safe to do so.\nAffectionately called “Pepe” by close friends, Popplewell was “a real kibbutznik” and a dedicated farmer who had a special connection with animals.\n“He’d sit in the evening with his Goldstar beer, relaxed, in a cowboy hat,” his sister told Haaretz.\n“There was always a puppy or five who adopted Pepe,” his friend Yochai Bashan wrote on Facebook after the funeral. “It just works differently with him.” He added that the two would spend time riding horses, and Popplewell often stopped Bashan mid-ride because he knew the horse was uncomfortable and needed the equipment adjusted. “I never understood how he knew. Pepe would understand their hearts and their needs without speaking.”\n“He was an amazing athlete, with tremendous physical strength,” Bashan wrote. Popplewell was also a highly talented artist who was much more interested in the process of creating art than receiving recognition or praise once it was completed. “He had a beautiful painting… that he kept behind his barn shoes full of cow dung.”\n“He was a tall, muscular, handsome guy with laughter in his eyes,” Bashan said of his late friend. “The girls tried to tame him and failed. Only the animals could get answers from him.”\nAt his funeral, Svatitzky promised her brother that she would not stop fighting for the return of their kidnapped family members.\nShe also told him that she was “comforted by the fact that you’re with Dad now… The murderers have taken you but they will never take our love and they will never be able to erase your memory from my heart and the hearts of all those who love you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

His grandfather, retired Col. Gideon Abbas, is among the first Druze soldiers to attain the rank of brigade commander in the IDF.\nJamal’s father, Col.

He raised his children with the army, taking them to military training and occasionally the Lebanese border during his service.\n“I raised them this way, that they should be fighters and officers… I always believed in their abilities and believed that they should serve the country like everyone else,” he said.\nDuring interviews about his son, Jamal Abbas’s father, Anan, noted the many Druze soldiers killed in the ongoing war and urged the Israeli government to change the Nation-State Law to define “Druze as an inseparable part of the State of Israel.”\nJamal Abbas died in the same battle as Staff. Sgt. Shachar Fridman — and the two soldiers’ fathers met in the wake of their deaths.\n“Shachar and Jamal, in life and in death they were not separated.

Take care, come back safely, and I’ll see you soon,” said Anan to his son over the phone.\n“Thank you very much Dad, and congratulations on the new rank,” Jamal replied.\n“Jamal was a playful person who loved to live and laugh.

    "story": "Sgt. Bar Yankilov, 19, a soldier in the Paratroopers Brigade, was killed on October 7 battling Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Kissufim.\nHe was buried on October 12 in his hometown of Karmiel. He is survived by his parents, Batya and Rambam, and his two sisters, Maya and Gal, as well as his girlfriend, Eliya Yanay.\nEliya told Ynet that on Saturday morning, he told his loved ones that his brigade was heading to the front lines to repel the Hamas invasion.\n“They didn’t know what they were getting into, they didn’t know the scale of the [attack],” she said. Midday they arrived at Kissufim, she said, to rescue the kibbutz residents: “Bar filled three buses full of civilians and then they started to shoot at them. They said it was intense fire, hundreds of terrorists, firing from 180 degrees. Bar and another three fighters were killed.”\nHis family said that though he was killed that day, they were not informed of his death until three days later, amid the chaos of the battles along the Gaza border.\nEliya told Channel 14 news that Bar “was special. His love of the nation was his priority, it’s something that his wonderful family always made sure to instill ever since he was a kid… He was planning a military career, he planned to advance to high places, he wanted to defend this country.”\n“Bar always said that we would get married, I knew that he was my future,” she added. “We planned to travel around the world, he really loved to travel, loved the country, we traveled a lot around Israel… He was a strong guy, he was Hercules, it’s hard to explain because he really was special, it’s not just another cliche.”\nHis sister, Gal, wrote on Facebook that she was wondering in the wake of his death “how I can bring the pure soul of my brother into every home.” Then she thought of the fact that “my brother loved to eat challah with spicy matbucha every Friday, he never passed it up every single Friday,” so she decided to make matbucha and challah each weekend in his memory and distribute it to families in the area.\n“Bar, you are a hero of an entire nation like so many other heroes,” Gal wrote. “But you are the best because you are my brother. I am a proud sister who still refuses to believe that I won’t see you again. Watch over us from above and I promise to do what I can so that everyone knows what a brave and strong warrior you were.”\nHis mother, Batya, told a local radio station, “Bar was my youngest, a wonderful kid who from a young age was interested in the heritage of Israel and loved the land and loved traveling around it.”\n“He wanted a military career,” she said, and when he was placed in the Paratroopers Brigade, “he was very satisfied and he said, ‘I made it to my place’… I want people to remember Bar and his bravery on behalf of the citizens, and the dreams he had that he did not get to achieve.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Army lookouts who spotted the terrorist invasion told soldiers at the base, including Nagar, to enter shelters. Nagar refused the instruction, insisting on staying at his post, alone, so that he could provide covering fire for other soldiers, according to multiple eyewitnesses and fellow servicemen.\nHe was eventually killed when his ammunition ran out after he had fired 675 bullets and killed dozens of terrorists.\nNagar’s brother Eden told The Times of Israel that soldiers who were at the base on the day of the attack all told the family the same thing: “Were Tomer not there, we would all be dead.”\nHis father told Channel 14 that before he enlisted in the army he volunteered in three different locations with at-risk youth, many of whom came to the shiva mourning house and told his family of the impact he had on their lives.\n“He really loved Israel and he loved to put others ahead of himself,” his brother, Eden, said in an interview with Channel 13 news.\nHis aunt, Ketty Dahary, described him at his funeral “as a hero with a soft and huge heart… I watched with love as you grew up, blossomed, matured, and became a charming young man, who took responsibility — at first for himself and then for everyone… I knew that wherever you would go you would succeed, you would captivate everyone immediately, and that’s how it was.”\nA noted lover of beer, his family decided to produce a beer in his name to memorialize him.\nHis family told Channel 13 that anytime Tomer had a break from the army he would go visit his grandmother “to speak with her a lot, to drink a cup of tea and to eat the tasty food she would make for him.” His grandmother said that “two days before he was killed he called her to tell her that he succeeded in convincing his commander to have her come and prepare couscous for the entire platoon.” They shared her recipe in his memory.\n“He was very introverted and very quiet, all his friends would say he was a quiet leader. He did a year of national service and impacted so many people, convinced them to enlist to meaningful combat service, and to do meaningful things on behalf of the nation, and all quietly and modestly — we found out about it only at his shiva,” his sister Gal told Channel 13 news.\n“I think he would want us to remember him with a smile — and ideally with a ‘cheers,'” Gal added. “He’d want us to bring a six-pack to the cemetery and to laugh with him.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Tal Levy, 21, squad commander in the Nahal Brigade’s 50th Battalion, was killed fighting terrorists in southern Israel on October 7.\nHe was buried on October 12 in the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem. He is survived by his parents, Zehava and Abraham Levy, and his siblings, Shiran, Michal and his twin, Noam.\nLevy served as a soldier for two years and seven months, and was a week and a half away from his discharge date, with a ticket to South America, when Hamas terrorists attacked the Gaza border communities on October 7.\nOn that Shabbat morning, Levy was with 11 of his soldiers at 6:30 in the morning at the Sufa outpost when the barrage of rocket fire began. He told them not to worry, reassuring them that it was similar to the other rockets they’d experienced in the previous month and a half.\nAs the barrage worsened, he put his soldiers in a bunker as 60 terrorists began invading the IDF outpost, followed by another wave of Hamas gunmen.\nLevy’s soldiers ran to get more ammunition as he attempted to hold off the terrorists’ fire for half an hour, not yet understanding the magnitude of the attack. The terrorists closed in on Levy and his soldiers and fired an RPG, targeting Levy and his soldiers, and killing four of them.\n“Even in your final moments, you were one of the first to make contact, you did everything you could to stop the terrorists and to protect your soldiers and the outpost,” said Levy’s platoon commander Ben Buklan and Major Daniel Lifshitz, in their eulogy for him.\nLevy was known to his friends, fellow soldiers and peers as someone with motivation and pride in his IDF service.\n“You were someone who could always be relied upon,” said Buklan. “You never asked ‘why me’ when given a task. You were a leading commander, with values and a caring attitude who loved his men, and was an amazing friend as well.”\nLevy was born and raised in the Ramot neighborhood of Jerusalem, where he attended the Or Torah High School in Ramot and was a dedicated fan of Beitar and Real Madrid soccer teams.\nHe was looking forward to his post-army trip, with a ticket purchased for December 4, 2023. Levy had already purchased all his equipment and on his last Shabbat at home, had tried it all on and said, “I’m ready for the big trip.”\nAs part of a series of projects to commemorate Levy, friends and family are collecting donations for a Torah scroll in his name, the restoration of Kibbutz Sufa next to where Levy served for the last month and a half of his service, and to purchase necessary equipment for the IDF soldiers.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

I love you and I will remember you forever with your captivating smile and your kind eyes.”\nAt her gravesite, her mother, Graza, described her as “our personal ray of sunshine who shone on us every day, the meaning in our lives.”\n“I am proud that you are my daughter.

It was his impressive service record that landed him the role of deputy commander of Maglan at the relatively young age of 26.\n“We would joke that if only it would work out some time that I would be his commander,” Shlomo said. “He never understood that I was prepared for him to be my commander.”\n“He had a different kind of humility, a reverence for every human being he touched,” he said. “He would always be at the point of most friction, learn the most complex things, always go to the most demanding units, but pleasantly, quietly, without a fuss. It seems like opposites, but with him, it was in perfect harmony.”\nHe described his brother as making “an incredible impact” on the people he met during his life.\n“Chen always did great things without a fuss and without stories, so I know that… his presence in the world will be strong because of the way he touched people and because of the way he was and who he was,” he said.\nChen was in Ashdod when the Hamas attack began with a massive barrage of rockets that set off sirens across Israel. He immediately made his way to his base, and from there headed south to the combat zone. Shlomo likewise traveled south with some other officers.\nThe two brothers stayed in contact during the morning, updating each other on the fighting, until Chen said he was heading to Kibbutz Nahal Oz.

    "story": "Rajesh Kumar Swarnakar, 25, a student from the village of Madhuwan in the Sunsari district of Nepal, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Alumim on October 7.\nHe was one of 10 Nepali agricultural students living and working on the kibbutz who were slain that day in the Hamas onslaught. When the air raid sirens began Saturday morning, the students ran toward the shelter as they had been told. But Hamas threw grenades inside the bomb shelter and shot at them, killing most.\n“We started shouting ‘We are Nepali, we are Nepali’ but they didn’t listen to anyone, they just kept firing and threw two grenades into the bunker,” one of the survivors, KC Pramod, told the Guardian. “After that, the bunker was completely covered in blood.”\nIn early November, Rajesh’s body was returned to his family in Nepal for burial.\nHis friend, Vivek Mahato, wrote on Facebook: “My friend Rajesh Kumar Swarnakar has lost his life due to Palestinian attack in Israel’s Gaza area. I pray for the departed soul to rest in peace in this tragic moment and pray to God to give strength to the family.”\nHis family told Al Jazeera that Rajesh was planning to join the Nepalese civil service after he returned from his training in Israel.\nHis brother, Mukesh Swarnakar, told the news outlet that he had texted Rajesh on Friday and they’d made plans for a video call on Saturday, but “I never heard from him again.”\nMukesh said his brother was very smart, and “the only bad decision he made was going to Israel. He should have known it’s not safe, there were bunkers and there was conflict.”\nMukesh told The Guardian that his family did not receive word of his death for several days and that their mother had not stopped crying since she got the news.\n“I am angry. Why was my brother sent to an area of conflict where he was not safe?” he said. “Nepali lives are seen as so cheap. For us he was the one who could earn money – he was the hope of the family.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

When the rocket fire started, they split up and headed in different directions, with Hoshen taking refuge in a roadside bomb shelter. Only three of the five friends returned home alive; Hoshen and her friend Livnat Levi were both murdered.\nHoshen was considered missing for 10 days after the massacre until her body was finally discovered. She was buried on October 17 in Petah Tikva.\nShe is survived by her mother, Galia, and four siblings. She was predeceased by her father, Avtalyon, who died eight years ago while she was completing a year of national service at a Jewish school in Los Angeles.\nAt the time of her murder, Hoshen had just started a job as a SOC analyst at the high-tech firm CloudEdge and was also involved in a travel startup. She loved to see the world and had only recently returned from a six-month trip to South America when she was murdered.\nShe loved to document her travels and her visits to festivals on her Instagram page: In her final post, shared on October 6, 2023, she wrote alongside a black-and-white photo of herself, simply: “I believe I can fly.” The bio on her page read: “Live your life to the fullest and cherish every day as if it were your last.”\nAt her funeral, her brother, Dor, tearfully eulogized her: “What a rose you were. Beautiful on the inside and out… I love you Hadar my sister. I miss you so much. I can’t breathe.”\n“As a child, Hadar was as sweet as a doll,” her mother, Galia, told La’Isha magazine. “Warm and loving, with a smile that never left her face. She was also a little stubborn, and when she grew up, that trait became assertiveness. She would set herself goals and achieve them one by one. She also had the widest heart… there was an energy that was out of this world. Anywhere she went she would lift everyone’s spirits with her laughter and joy for life.”\nHer cousin, Tchiya Zinnar, wrote on Instagram about Hadar’s “shining personality, joy, the craziest in the family, crazy in the way you can’t miss her when she enters a room, and things immediately start to move and come to life… Crazy in the way you dance and are really happy as if nobody is watching, with your radiant personality and a huge smile on your face.”\n“Thank you for who you were for me, for the many experiences we had together, for the laughter and the fun and the TikToks and the photos,” Zinnar wrote. “Thank you for teaching me what bravery is and how to grow from difficulties. How to be true to yourself, how to set a goal and go after it with all your strength until you achieve it… to fight for who you are and what you love. To be happy, to smile, and to laugh endlessly, from your whole heart.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

After more than 24 hours, Yisrael was rescued by IDF soldiers only to find out that his wife had been burned alive in her home. His daughter told the Walla news site that he left with a suitcase full of both of their medication that was riddled with shrapnel.\n“He told [the soldiers] he had to go to mom,” said their daughter Einat. “They wouldn’t let him. He started to go and he saw her. What did he see? It’s better not to say.”\nAfter her body was eventually evacuated and identified, she was buried on October 18 in Givat Brenner. She is survived by her husband, Yisrael, two children, Yuval and Einat, and four grandchildren.\nShe was recalled as a lifelong educator, devoted to her pupils, and a wonderful mother and grandmother.\nHer former student, Liat Levi, wrote on Facebook that Chulati was “the reason that I finished school! Always supported, helped, embraced — there are people in this world who leave a mark on you for your whole life, Menuha was one of them… you will always stay in my heart, but now my heart is broken and shattered.”\nHer granddaughter, Ilona Chulati, who was rescued from the nearby Nahal Oz after 18 hours, told Haaretz that she was in touch with both her grandparents that Saturday morning until the connection was cut midday. “I was very close to them,” she said. “When I was born they were 49, so I experienced them also at a relatively young age for grandparents.”\nAt a memorial ceremony for the kibbutz movement in mid-November, Yisrael recounted how they settled as a family in Kissufim in 1976 and became integral members of the small kibbutz.\n“She was a beloved and appreciated teacher by hundreds of students,” he said, noting that she also served for a period as kibbutz community manager “with the sensitivity, empathy and pleasantness that characterized her.” She was also, he said, “an incredible wife, mother and grandmother.”\nYisrael recounted that one of their granddaughters said that “when they were little, you would hold them by the hand on trips around the kibbutz.” In later years, he said, “You asked them to hold on to your hand because it was hard for you to walk… That’s how it was supposed to be. We were supposed to hold onto your hand until you were ready to let go of us, but they tore you away from us and they didn’t give us a chance to look into your eyes again and realize how much you loved us.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

They never heard from him again. After almost 24 hours without any word, members of the family drove to where he was last seen to search for him, and found his body and those of his four friends, riddled with bullets, lying on the side of the road.\nHe was buried on October 15 in Moshav Tzohar. He is survived by his parents, Yonit and Meir, and four younger siblings: Ofir, Roi, Guy and Nitzan.\nHe grew up in Moshav Sde Nitzan near southern Gaza, where his family runs the Turgeman Farm.\nHis mother, Yonit, described her son on Facebook: “My Dudi loved life, he lived for parties and friends, long weekends of 24/7 parties, he breathed motorcycle trips and nature, he built and assembled projects in the garden and all this he combined with work that he loved so much. My Dudi didn’t waste a minute or even a second of life, he partied for hours and days without sleep, few could keep up with him which is why he had different groups of friends for different activities.”\nOn the day of his funeral, Yonit wrote: “You are the one who gave meaning to my life and made me a mother for my whole life. Thank you for 26 years that you gave me the honor of being a proud mother until your last moment. I want to believe that you always knew that being your mom is forever, in good and bad and in life and also afterward. I want to believe that my heart is shattered into a thousand pieces because one special piece that will always be missing went along with you to surround you in heaven.”\nDudi’s lifelong friend, Yarin Almasi, wrote on Facebook that he was “taken from us at such a young age. You were so beautiful and smiley and happy and joyous and energetic.”\nDudi, Almasi asked, “Do you remember all of our experiences together? All the nonsense we did together? You were the king of nonsense. And forever you will remain the king of nonsense. Tell me, do you remember all of our trips? Thailand, Greece, Eilat, the north, Tel Aviv? Because I, I simply can’t forget them… You are one of a kind like no other. One who was always surrounded by others. Why? Because you were simply everything. You were the light of all of us. The laughter, the joy, the energy.”\nHis sister, Ofir, wrote on Facebook about the experience of having a brother like Dudi: “It’s to know that no matter what’s happening Dudi will find a solution to everything. It’s to know that even if he doesn’t tell you anything you can tell him everything because he’ll never tell anyone and always keep your secrets. It’s to know that even if he laughs and seems not serious he can focus in three seconds if something is wrong and he will always make you smile even if you’re crying.”\nOfir described her brother as generous, caring, making friends in a heartbeat, and always there for them: “He would travel even to the end of the world and back to help you.” Since his murder, she said, the family has been surrounded by mourners and friends who have come to tell stories and how they “get photos and videos every day from friends where it is written underneath: ‘I’m not responsible for what you’ll see,’ because he was always doing nonsense.”\nShe wrote that now when she hears “sirens or gunfire I don’t even move from my mattress because I have nothing left to lose in this world… I miss you Dudi.

Yehonatan was an extremely strong man. He could kill someone with one hand, but he was a soft man, sensitive and wise.”\nYehonatan grew up in the West Bank settlement of Yitzhar and then settled in Kedumim to raise his family.\nWhen Hamas struck on October 7 he was immediately alerted and, as the commander of a specialized frontline unit, was directed to head south and take part in battles against the invading terrorists. The exact circumstances of his death were not immediately clear.\nIn a notification of his passing, the local Kedumim council described him as someone who “grew up loving the people and the country and saw in his role as a commander [in the army] a national mission to strengthen the Jewish people in its land.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was very smart, you could seek his advice on anything. He was a huge light.”\nReuth wrote online that Ben “had the biggest smile on his face, the kind that wasn’t fitting to the situation, that would cause you to smile so big even if everything inside is broken.

But since she was a child she was a brilliant girl, always surrounded by many friends, a true leader, very social, everyone always wanted to spend time with her.”\nShaked said that, while the family was waiting for news of her fate, as soon as he heard that at least one of the soldiers who was with Shir in the Nahal Oz war room that Saturday morning was killed, “I knew that the situation with Shir is definitely not good, because I know that if someone in the war room was killed, nobody made it out alive, and Shir hadn’t made it out alive because she would never leave one of her soldiers behind.”\nFrom others, Shaked said, they learned that Shir “stayed calm, worried about everyone, protected them, and calmed them down… She put herself aside and worried about them.”\nHer sister, Nir, wrote on social media that “my heart will never again return to being whole.”\n“Your smile melted every chamber of my heart, and certainly everyone else’s,” Nir wrote. “As the days go by, I go about my day with the feeling that you are in the army and you will come back soon. I feel you living and I can’t fathom that you are no longer.”\n“Your laugh plays in my head nonstop, our moments together, our experiences from a young age, our strong connection and the enormous love between us — we would speak to each other with our eyes,” she added. “Now what is left is for me to speak with the heavens and to hope that you hear me.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

There, with a gun in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other, he fired at invaders until he was shot and killed.\n“He did what he had to do, he was a father and a grandfather,” his son, Yohai told the Kan public broadcaster. “He would do it again, without thinking twice, take the gun and go to protect his daughter and grandchildren.”\nHis body was not discovered until more than a week later. He was buried in late October after his children who were abroad arrived in Israel.\nA lifelong kibbutz resident, Bar-Sinai was a talented architect who was deeply involved in growing and shaping the kibbutz as well as surrounding towns and communities.\nHe served as a reservist in the Yom Kippur War and then studied architecture at the Technion, during which time he met and married Nili, according to a kibbutz eulogy.\nAccording to Ynet, he worked for more than 40 years with the AlefBet Planners architecture firm, spearheading its efforts in the south, and designing notable buildings, including the Be’eri printing press and Sapir College in Sderot.\nFellow architect Danny Bar-Kama told Ynet that the late architect’s “design of the Be’eri printing press emphasizes Bar-Sinai’s relationship to the kibbutz in which he grew up and his desire to combine existing architecture with innovative design,” adding that he had “an aspiration to maintain” parts of the original building to match the rest of the kibbutz.\nIn later years he took his expertise around the world, in particular with community planning in Africa, including projects in Angola, South Africa and elsewhere.\n“Yoram was passionate about Africa and about creating and bringing innovative solutions to rural development, specifically, housing,” wrote Zeevik Halber, who worked with him on such projects. “Yoram was a people’s man and was able to make contact with everyone on site. It was amazing to see how people reacted to him… always calm, always looking at things in a way that none others would. Gentle person with so much experience and knowledge, yet so humble.”\nHis son, Yohai, told the Kan public broadcaster that his father “lived the kibbutz and its fields and spaces in every limb of his being, in recent years he planted hundreds of trees around the kibbutz… to add greenery to the areas, and he would go around on a tractor he bought specially to water them.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Naor Hasidim, 23, and his longtime girlfriend Sivan Elkabets, 23, were murdered by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7.\nThe couple, who both grew up in Ashdod, were together since they were 16, when they met in high school. They were killed inside Sivan’s apartment in the youth wing in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, where her family moved a few years ago.\nNeighbors said the couple were likely pulled out by terrorists from their secure room and murdered on the couch in their living room.\nThey were buried side-by-side in Ashdod several days apart, as their bodies were discovered separately. The Hebrew phrase “in life and in death, they did not part” is written across their double headstone.\nSivan is survived by her parents, Shimon and Anat, and her siblings Nadav, Guy and Noa. Naor is survived by his parents, Avi and Galit, and three siblings, Mor, Noa and Eliya.\nNaor had recently started a new job in sales at the Cal credit card company in Ashdod. Sivan was studying computer science at the Sapir College in Sderot.\nSivan’s father, former Galatz director Shimon Elkabets, wrote in Ma’ariv about his daughter.\n“You had such gentleness in you, but also stubborness and persistence and extraordinary diligence,” he wrote. “You were also independent, trusting, knowledgable. And when you weren’t, you always knew how to ask, you knew how to lighten up any challenging moment and make every task possible.”\nShimon wrote that Sivan was an excellent student, impressing all of her teachers, and also shone during her army service as a fitness instructor in the Air Force. “My little girl, my Sivani, the terrorists murdered you, but not who you were to all of us. You cannot murder beauty and morals. You cannot destroy kindness and true love. You cannot burn knowledge and wisdom. You can’t shoot and erase a smile and embracing arms.”\nSivan’s sister, Noa Elkabets, wrote on Facebook about her “‘little sister,’ who was always ‘bigger’ than me — taller, more noble, more gentle, more beautiful, more intelligent and thoughtful, more upright, more diligent, more convincing, because the way you spoke to the world was a more welcoming, correct way that gave a good feeling — you brought everyone toward you, without even trying.”\nNaor’s sister, Mor Ben Hemo, wrote on Facebook that her brother was “the best and the warment. Thank you for 23 years where you made me laugh endlessly, watched over me and made sure that I would always have a smile on my face. During hard times you had my back. Speaking about you in the past tense burns my heart, but the way I felt on that Saturday is how I continue to feel — that you are with me in every step.”\nMor described him as “a boy who gives the world to those around him, a boy who makes everyone laugh when he makes fun of us with that mischievous smile that cracks us up, a boy who always put a smile on your face, and if there sometimes wasn’t he would turn the world upside down just to make you smile.”\nOn what would have been Naor’s 24th birthday, his mother, Galit, wrote on Facebook: “January 3 arrived and you are not with us. Everything has become unimportant, meaningless, too sad, empty. You were a child full of light, joy, smiles and goals, full of love… I miss our days together, we had everything we needed, and now I feel that there is nothing. I love you Naor and Sivan, thank you for all the good you brought us, you were so special, and only those who knew you would understand.”\nAlso on his birthday, his father, Avi, visited the apartment in Kfar Aza where he was murdered: “Today is his birthday. I came here to spend some time sitting in communion with him, to pray,” Avi told Reuters, while wearing a T-shirt with a photo of Naor and Sivan on the front. “There is a hole in my heart. I don’t know if it will close. It is opening wider and wider and wider.”\nAvi said that he was only managing to cope with his grief through happy memories of the couple, including their joy at his daughter Mor’s wedding just a few months earlier: “How he danced, how she danced. How they hugged and kissed. How much they loved everyone and everyone loved them. These are the most beautiful memories in the world.”\nReuters contributed to this report.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He is survived by his wife, Adar, their four children, Eshhar, Arbel, Ido and Omer, his parents Rafi and Edna and his sisters Tzipi, Hamutal and Anat. He was predeceased by another sister, Sivan.\nAt the time of his death, Ben Basat was the most senior IDF officer to have been killed in the ground offensive against Hamas.\nAt his funeral, his wife Adar said she had found it impossible to pen his eulogy: “All night I tried to write, I couldn’t get to it and my heart is dying over saying goodbye,” she said. “This morning I woke up and we cried, the kids and I. Five broken hearts that love you and are connected to you.”\n“Over the past few years you invested so much in your relationship with each one of them,” Adar added. “You built a true and moving connection. Thank you for choosing me, for choosing us, thank you for our joint journey and for everything. Thank you for the trip that was supposed to celebrate your release from the army in the US and Mexico, which was the achievement of all of our dreams. Thank you for giving me the sense that you were really coming back, and we would make up for all of the other vacations [we didn’t take]. I embroidered dreams for both of us and some of them I will have to accomplish without you.”\nHis mother, Edna, said in her eulogy: “In my eyes, you were invincible. I was sure that you had special protection. There are many things I want to say about you, you are my child, unique and special. You devoted your life to protecting the land… you were a leader and an initiator. Golani was  your home. You served always on the edge, and when you decided in the summer to complete your service, we were so happy that you made it out healthy and whole.”\nThe head of the IDF Personnel Directorate Maj. Gen. Yaniv Asor recalled that Ben Basat was at home on vacation ahead of his slated retirement from the IDF when the October 7 massacre happened. He raced to the front lines, jumped into a jeep to help rescue residents under fire near the Gaza border, and decided to remain in the military once the war broke out.\n“From the moment you fell, I started running through our first meeting in my head. A short meeting was enough for us, you stood out with quiet leadership, strived for contact, set norms, and joined the group that every battalion commander dreamed of,” he said. “Together we grew, and I learned a chapter in responsible leadership from you. We will continue in your spirit until victory.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

At 7:20 a.m., she told her parents that she was leaving due to the rocket fire and asked them to pick her up from Tel Aviv. They never heard from her again.\n“We were sure that she was on her way home, we were so sure,” her mother, Dganit, told Channel 13 news. “At 10 a.m. when she wasn’t reachable, and we saw the news on TV, we started to worry.”\nAfter a week, her body was found and she was buried on October 15 in Tel Aviv. She was shot dead alongside her friend, Dorin Atias, while a third friend with them, Eden Yerushalmi, was kidnapped to Gaza and later murdered in captivity.\nLior is survived by her parents, Dganit and Yariv, and her younger siblings Agam and Yaheli.\nHer cousin, Shahar Maimon, told Channel 13 news that she was also at the Supernova rave that day, and didn’t know Lior was there until she passed by her as everyone was running from rocket fire.\n“I called out to her, and she was on the phone to [her mother] at the time, and as soon as she saw me the first thing she wanted to do was to call my mother and tell her that I was OK,” recounted Shahar. “I gave her one final hug.”\n“She was a wonderful person, she had so many friends, and she was murdered at such a young age, but if there’s something you can say about Lior, it’s that she lived her life as you should,” said Shahar. “She loved to have fun, to go out, she loved people. She was an angel — and now she’s really an angel.”\nThe singer David Carmel, whose mother was close friends with Lior’s mother, released a song, titled “And Maybe,” dedicated to Maimon, featuring video footage of her as a child and young woman, and lyrics including: “There aren’t enough words in the world/ To fill the hole that you left behind here/ There aren’t enough prayers in the world/ To drown out the pain of longing.”\nHer mother, Dganit, wrote on Facebook, that her daughter was “a girl with a heart of gold full of endless generosity. Beautiful on the inside and the outside. They say that God takes the best, and now I know that it’s true — there is no doubt.\n“Liori, we are asking forgiveness from you, for all the times we bothered you, we made comments, we worried too much — it was all for you,” she added. “And despite it all, we didn’t succeed in saving you and protecting you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was an involved member of the community, managing the pub and helping to manage the basketball team.\nIn recent years he had taken up carpentry, and worked with an initiative helping elderly people in the kibbutz aged-care facility make wooden toys.\nOn the morning of October 7, Naveh was at his home on the kibbutz, fielding messages from neighbors on WhatsApp about how to secure their safe room doors against the terrorists who had infiltrated the Gaza border community.\nWhen he learned that Fricker was having trouble locking the door of her safe room he left his house to try to save her immediately, but was injured on the way. He was spotted and evacuated by two members of the local security team and was killed when terrorists destroyed the building where he was hidden.\n“The kibbutz he built with his own hands was hit hard, but the roots he planted in it remained strong. The houses will be rebuilt. The flowers will bloom again,” read his eulogy on the Kibbutz Be’eri website.\nHis son, Dotan, wrote on Facebook, “Everyone says I look like Mom, but I naturally always felt closer to Dad in a number of ways. His love of creating with his hands, of being exact, of planning. All of his technical abilities I aspired to have as well… Of course there were also many differences and disagreements but I knew that I could always go to him for help and he would come anywhere for me.”\nFricker was born in Tel Aviv, to two Holocaust survivors. After a difficult childhood, she settled in Kibbutz Be’eri as a lone soldier in 1972, where she married her first husband and gave birth to her first child, Aviva. They divorced two years later.\nShe had two more daughters, Sigal and Stav, with her second husband, Albert Miles, who was also killed in Be’eri on October 7.\nAmong various roles on the kibbutz, Fricker most enjoyed working as a seamstress. She spent many years in this career, even after she reached retirement age. She loved wearing colorful, flowery dresses and fancy shoes, and was always well-groomed despite the casual environment of the kibbutz. She also loved to paint, especially oil on canvas.\nHer neighbors remember her as softly-spoken, always wearing a smile.\nHer son-in-law, Andrey Elgort, wrote on Facebook that Fricker was “the best mother, grandmother and mother-in-law in the world, and we will never forget you, we will always remind your beloved granddaughters how much you were there for them and how much you loved them.”\nThree days before October 7, during Sukkot, the extended family had gathered to celebrate at Fricker’s house. According to their friends and neighbors, the couple had a happy blended family, taking care of each other’s children as their own and enjoying family meals together.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Sgt. First Class (res.) Joseph Gitarts, 25, a Russian-Israeli from Tel Aviv, was killed on December 25 while battling Hamas in southern Gaza.\nHe was buried on December 27 in the Kiryat Shaul military cemetery in Tel Aviv. He is survived by his parents, Larissa and Ya’akov, and four half-siblings from his parents’ previous marriages.\nGitarts was killed after an anti-tank missile hit the tank he was driving in south Gaza. He died on the scene, and the three other soldiers who were with him in the tank were unharmed. He was slated to be released from IDF reserve duty just five days later, on December 30, to continue his studies at the Reichman University in Herzliya since the delayed academic year was finally to begin.\nJoseph and his parents immigrated to Israel from Russia when he was 12, and he attended the International American School in Tel Aviv. He was first drafted to the army for non-combat duty, but insisted on becoming a combat soldier in the Armored Corps. After finishing his active duty in 2021, he started his BA studies in the Computer Sciences faculty at Reichman, where he was an honors student and a class representative. He was interested in biotechnology: “My mission is to contribute to the fight against aging and disease through technology,” he wrote on Linkedin.\nCalled up for reserve duty on October 8, Gitarts spent about six weeks on a training base. Speaking with his mom on the phone from the base, he said: “It’s the first time in my life that I feel that I am part of something bigger than me. You can’t imagine the atmosphere here… There are all kinds of people, with different views, but we sing together all the time, and there is a feeling of love and unity.”\nWhen the soldiers were informed that their battalion would soon enter Gaza to battle Hamas in the south, Gitarts wrote a letter to his parents to be delivered to them in case he did not return alive. He sent half of the link to the Google doc to his girlfriend in Russia and the second half of the link to his brother in Israel, instructing both to send the information they had to his mother in case he died.\n“Dear Mom and Dad,” he wrote in Russian, “I love you very much. Everything is as it is supposed to be. I have chosen this. I had a good and interesting life. And yet, I was never afraid of death. I could have skipped reserve duty and hid. But this would contradict everything I believe in and appreciate, and who I consider myself to be. So I didn’t really have a choice, and I would do the same if I could choose again. I came to this decision by myself and stuck with it until the end. I fell proudly for the sake of my people. I have no regrets.\n“I love you very much and I am proud that you are my parents. You gave me a lot. I had a very interesting, happy, unique life. My death only highlights it,” he continued. “Undoubtedly, you are in deep pain. But you will manage it. I would like it a lot. It is the main thing that I want. Both of you have many close people who will support you. Please, find something positive in all of this. Spend time with your grandchildren. Help Israel. I am OK.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

His funeral was held on December 3 at the Segula Cemetery in Petah Tikva.\nAccording to his friends, Sama, who went by the nickname Assi, was “the heart of the company,” Haaretz reported. Days before his death, he told his battalion commander: “I’m your flack jacket.”\n“I’m willing to take a bullet so that you can lead the battalion to victory,” he said.\nAccording to Maariv, Sama was critically injured after warning fellow soldiers to step away from a tunnel they had just discovered.\n“Move away from here, it’s dangerous here,” officers recounted him saying before the explosion occurred.\nSama was remembered by his loved ones for his dimpled smile which never faded — seen in a photo of him circulating in the media following his death.\nSama, who moved to Israel in 2007 with his family, had previously appeared in an Israeli newspaper — back in 2009, amid coverage of Israeli schools that balked at admitting recent Ethiopian immigrants.\n“Many of my friends don’t know where they’ll go to school,” Sama, then 6 years old, told the Haaretz daily. “I want to learn, I am ashamed a little that I still haven’t begun to learn. But I’d really to to be like everyone else.”\nSama was eventually accepted into Mosenson Youth Village, an agricultural boarding school in Hod Hasharon geared towards new immigrants.\nSama had “a very big heart, who always had a smile on his face… If he saw someone in a bad mood, he would always perk his friend up.

Assi was determined to be recruited for a meaningful combat service. He dreamed of being a fighter. He loved humanity and loved the country.”\nHe was “a mischievous boy with two dimples, full of joy for life and love of his country,” she said, adding, “In his yearbook, he wrote a sentence that he would always say: ‘Conquer your fears.'”\nIn a post eulogizing him, Sama’s school friends said he was a “beloved student and friend among the buddies and teaching staff.”\n“He always helped and supported his friends.

    "story": "Gil Buyum, 55, and his son Inbar “Buri” Buyum, 22, were both killed on October 7 trying to repel a Hamas invasion of Kibbutz Be’eri.\nAfter a long wait, their bodies were finally recovered and they were buried in Savyon on October 17.\nThey are survived by their wife/mother, Ayelet, and children/siblings Omer, 20, Anog, 18 and Adi, 16. Gil’s sister, Shiri Weiss, was kidnapped to Gaza with her daughter Noga; they were released on November 25. Shiri’s husband, Ilan, was missing for close to three months and declared dead on January 1. Gil is also survived by his mother, Tamar, and his brothers Yaron and Lior.\nAs a member of the kibbutz’s local security team, Gil was retroactively recognized as a fallen soldier with the rank of warrant officer in the reserves.\nGil was at home when the attack began and he left the house to fight the terrorist invasion. His brother-in-law, Ofer Revivo, told The New York Times that Gil “fought with them and managed to kill a few, but then ran out of ammunition.” He was shot twice in the legs and died shortly afterward in a kibbutz clinic.\nInbar was at his girlfriend Yuval’s house in the nearby town of Mabu’im, following a 12-hour shift as a security guard in Ashkelon. When he heard what was going on, he decided to go pick up his weapon from his workplace and try and protect his home of Be’eri. He was ambushed and killed along the way. The family believes they both died within minutes of each other, in two different locations.\nGil, who worked at the Be’eri printing house, was remembered as a loving and devoted father, who loved to travel in Israel and abroad, and was a big fan of music. Inbar, who was contemplating starting medical studies after he was released in mid-2023 from his military service — where he was a paramedic in the Golani Brigade — was recalled as a loving big brother, who also was a big music fan, and loved to add to his already extensive collection of tattoos.\n“All my body is shouting ‘why them’ because they were like angels,” Ayelet told The New York Times. “Both of them have good faith and pure hearts.” While her husband was a member of the kibbutz security team, her son didn’t have to head to the frontline, she noted, “but he’s not that type of person… he always wanted to keep his friends and his family safe.”\nIn an interview with Channel 13 news, Ayelet said “I want to scream out my grief so that people know who Gil was and who Inbar was… every night he would tell me ‘I love you,’ until his last night,” she said of her husband.\n“Everything we wanted, he would do for us,” Gil’s daughter Anog told Channel 13. “The smallest thing, even in the middle of the night, if something didn’t work, he would immediately come to help. He was a perfect father.”\nInbar’s girlfriend, Yuval Tal, told the TV network that “he was wonderful, he was a little shy, so he approached me in a shy manner. We started talking right away about our tattoos, and we discovered we had the same tattoo.”\nHis mother said “[Inbar] was a kid who was always in the center of things. He had this kind of backbone, he was always the listener — the friend who listened, the friend who supported.” His brother, Adi, said he was not surprised Inbar had set out to protect the kibbutz: “These are the values that my Mom and Dad raised us with, all of the siblings — to go, to help, as much as we can, the family, everyone — to put others first.”\nIn a post on Facebook, Omer wrote to his father and brother: “Gil and Inbar, the beloved and the lovely, in life and death did not part. You both went out to protect and you were both taken from us at 7:30 a.m. — at different locations but together.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Maj. Adir Meir Abudi, 23, the commander of the Tavor Company in the Home Front Command, from Modiin, was killed on October 7 battling Hamas terrorists trying to infiltrate the IDF Zikim base.\nHe was buried on October 10 in Modiin. He is survived by his parents, Anat and Yehezkel, his siblings, Yossi, Liel and Natan, and his girlfriend, Alexa Baluev.\nAbudi was one of the most senior commanders on duty at the Zikim training base when it was attacked by Hamas. Abudi took charge and went to fight the invasion and told all the young trainees on base to seek shelter, saving their lives. Six of the commanders, including Abudi, were killed in the battle, and all but one trainee emerged alive, and the base was ultimately not overrun.\n“Adir decided to bring all the trainees out of their guard posts and replace them with commanders,” recounted one female commander who took part in the battle, in a conversation with Channel 13 news. Hours later, after a number of soldiers on the front had already been killed, “Adir tried to run in a zig-zag toward the terrorists, and he was shot in the heart.”\nCpt. Or Moses and Cpl. Neria Aharon Nagiri — the only new recruit killed in Zikim — tried to rescue Abudi, and were also shot dead.\nHis girlfriend, Alexa Baluev — who met Adir during her army service — recounted to the TV network that “I wrote to him to look after himself, not to be a hero — I didn’t want him to be a hero. I’m the most proud of him in the world. But I didn’t want him to be a hero… but that was Adir. He always told me that he was waiting for this moment, to be at the front, to take charge, to protect the country.”\nAbudi was a devoted soccer fan, regularly participating in games as well as watching the sport, and his family is arranging a tournament in his honor in his hometown of Modiin.\nHis brother, Yossi, told Channel 13 that “he was a king. He was my brother and my best friend. Adir, to me, was almost everything.”\nHis mother, Anat, told a local Modiin news site that her son was the kind of person “who knew what friendship was, who knew how to identify hardship of a friend and lift his spirits… Adir was a person who entered the hearts of people. He wasn’t someone who passed by, but burrowed in and remained within you, a boy with endless generosity.”\nShe recounted that while their family has no connection to the Holocaust, Adir would give generously to charities that helped Holocaust survivors, and was always deeply concerned when he had IDF trainees who struggled to have enough food.\n“He bought food vouchers for them with his own money and told them that it was from the army and not from him, so they wouldn’t feel uncomfortable,” she said.\nAnat told Israel Hayom that her son was “a quiet boy, introverted, but when we saw his behavior as a commander we got to know a different Adir, one of those people who leave a mark. As a commander, he was modest with a very high work ethic, who fought until the end and didn’t lose his fighting spirit — until a bullet hit him in the heart.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Four members of the same extended family were murdered in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7: Pessi Cohen, 68, who lived in the kibbutz, and her guests — her sister Hanna “Hani” Sitton, 73, brother-in-law Yitzhak “Zizi” Sitton, 76, of Hod Hasharon, and her nephew Tal Sitton, 49, from Rehovot.\nHamas terrorists who infiltrated the kibbutz gathered a number of captives from around Be’eri and forced them into Cohen’s home. In total 40 Hamas gunmen and 14 hostages were holed up inside. Hamas had already killed several of them when a gunfight broke out between the terrorists and the IDF, as Hamas stationed themselves behind the hostages amid the crossfire. All those remaining inside were killed, except one Israeli who survived.\nThe bodies of Pessi, Hani, Zizi and Tal were only identified 11 days later, and they were buried together on October 19 in Hod Hasharon.\nFamily members noted that Hani, Zizi and Tal had gone to Be’eri to be with Pessi as she marked the Hebrew anniversary of the death of her husband, Rafi, who died suddenly in 2016 in an accident, as well as to celebrate the Simhat Torah holiday together.\nHani and Zizi are survived by their other three children, Lior, Noa and Ron, and nine grandchildren. Pessi is survived by her four children: Shai, Hila, Keren and Guy, and 10 grandchildren. Tal is survived by his two daughters.\nTal Sitton was a veteran of a number of high-tech startups, and a few years ago started Softale, his own consulting firm for startups. His former employer, EyeClick, said that “Tal was an integral part of the EyeClick team from 2021 to 2022, leaving a lasting impact with his exceptional dedication and kindness. Tal was a remarkable person, and his absence will be deeply felt by all who had the privilege of knowing him.”\nZizi Siton was earlier in the textile business, later changing direction to manage a diamond factory in South Africa, splitting his time between there and Israel, where Hani remained with their kids.\nPessi’s daughter-in-law, Sharon Tzuella Cohen, wrote on Facebook about the heartbreak of the quadruple loss: “How can we understand and accept that you left us alone? Aunt Hanna, Zizi, Tal, I can’t describe how much we will miss you, and how much your winning recipes will be missed — the tastiest brownies in the universe, that no matter how much we tried never came out like yours Aunt Hanna.”\nSharon wrote that she had seen Tal a number of times in the past year “and we were blessed with many hours together, many conversations… Zizi you stood there like a hero and protected them with your body in the safe room, you held the door with all your strength but unfortunately they came prepared with incredible amounts of weapons and people.”\n“Taltul and Hanna, you were there with Pessi and the feeling that she was not alone in that moment provides a tiny bit of comfort to a broken heart. Our savtushit, Pessi, beautiful with eyes the color of the sea and the biggest heart in the world. In the past seven years, you chose to live at full power along with the grief over Rafi and the tragedy… you went out, you traveled, you enjoyed.”\nAt their quadruple funeral, their cousin, Pasi Cohen (named after the same grandmother as Pessi), described how their families were reunited more than 15 years after the Holocaust, when she was 8 years old and her father discovered that his sister had survived and was also living in Israel.\n“Finally I had family, we grew up together, we spent every vacation together, our children loved each other — we loved each other so much,” she said. “They raised children wonderfully, and I was sure that it would be forever. And then, again, a holocaust, murder, they murdered them in cold blood. Our whole family is in pain.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Itay Shlomo Moreno, 24, from Aderet, a soldier in the Maglan commando unit, was killed battling Hamas terrorists along the Zikim beach on October 11.\nHe was buried on October 12 in the Mount Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem. He was killed alongside his best friend, Master Sgt. Daniel Kastiel.\nHe is survived by his wife, Gal, his parents Tamar and Moshe and his siblings Adi, Eitan and Noa.\nHis uncle, Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno, a special forces commando, was killed fighting in Lebanon in 2006 at age 35. To this day the IDF has never published a photo of the legendary combat soldier, due to the sensitivity of the operations in which he took part.\nAnother uncle, Rabbi Shmuel Moreno, told Channel 14 news that his nephew was “a charming young man, a person who was fully modest, humble. He charged ahead, with great dedication to the people of Israel… a pleasant guy, modest, sheepish, very smart, very handsome — he was, as his wife Gal said, ‘perfection.'”\nHis younger sister, Noa, 9, told the Kan public broadcaster that “he was always smiling — he had the most beautiful smile in the world. He always loved me, called me his baby, doll, princess. He taught me how to do the thing I love to do most in the world, to sing. I sang with him at his wedding — he would play and I would just sing.” Noa said her brother “taught me how to do so many things, and I’m scared to forget them.”\nHis father, Moshe Moreno, penned an article in Ynet with the headline: “Where will I stand now on Mount Herzl, next to my son or next to my brother?”\n“I gave this country my heroic brother Emmanuel in 2006 and I have now given my son Itay… I have nothing left to give, but I want what I already gave to not be in vain,” he wrote.\n“In his life Itay succeeded in everything he did,” wrote his father. “There was nothing he was not good at: he was a talented athlete, the best ‘Negevist’ there was in the army, afterward he joined the Shin Bet, married the wonderful Gal, built a home, was accepted to engineering studies.”\n“My perfect child was also my best friend,” he continued. “Sought my advice on everything, it was always important to him what I thought, he always made sure I would be satisfied. Every year [on Memorial Day] he would give me strength on Mount Herzl — and now what? Who will hold me and who will strengthen me? Where will I stand, next to Itay or next to Emmanuel? I love you Itay, and I have no choice but to be strong for you.”\nHis wife, Gal, wrote on Facebook that she saw a notice in the newspaper of his death, “they noted that you were the nephew of an Israeli hero! But you were that too. It’s important for me that the whole world will know that you were Itay Shlomo Moreno!! You are the most modest and humble person there was, a hero of Israel. You never agreed to use the title ‘nephew of’ because you were a straightforward, justice-seeking person, and you always told me that you wanted to succeed by merit and not by favor.”\n“My Itay, my heart, my first and only love,” she wrote. “You spread light everywhere you entered. How am I eulogizing you and speaking about you in the past tense? I was privileged to be by your side from age 17 until your last day… your dream was a family and children, a little kingdom of our own.”\nGal wrote that “I am the wife of the funniest and most kind-hearted person in existence. The world lost such a great light. We dreamed about Thailand, Argentina, we dreamed to finish our studies together, we dreamed of a home and children and everything was taken away.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Dorin “Dora” Atias, 23, from Ganei Tikva, was murdered by Hamas terrorists after fleeing the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nShe was slated to begin a bartending shift at the rave at 7 a.m., but arrived early to enjoy and dance with her friends before she started working. When rocket sirens started sounding, she fled in her car seeking safety, but was shot dead alongside her friend Lior Maimon, while their other friend, Eden Yerushalmi, was taken captive and murdered in Gaza.\nHer body was discovered on October 11 and she was buried on October 12 in Savyon. She is survived by her parents, Tali and Meir, and her brother Niv.\nDorin was slated to receive her certification as a pilates instructor on October 8, her family said, and had already gone looking for studio space. She served in the IDF as an observation soldier in the Border Defense Corps along the Gaza border, and after she was released and saved up money she spent eight months traveling in South America, returning about a year before she was killed.\n“She had a lot of dreams,” her mother, Tali Hadad Atias, told the Davar news outlet. “To open a pilates studio, to travel around the world, to be in the ocean, to play footvolley, to live life to the end.”\nShe said her daughter was “a perfect child… a girl of light and love with a huge heart. She couldn’t walk past a homeless person without giving him something. She was a child of the outdoors, a scout instructor, a talented footvolley player who loved the sea. Every Friday she would spend the entire day from morning to night at the beach — but she would still show up to Friday night dinner with flowers.”\nTali said Dorin moved to Tel Aviv and worked as a bartender, “and as far as she was concerned she was living the dream. Living near the sea, working in a bar, wandering around the city, she knew everyone. She was happy. I would walk around with her and it felt like I was going around with the prime minister. She had so many friends.”\nHer friend Inbar Saban told the Guardian that Atias “was like my little sister that I chose myself at the age of 12,” adding that she was beloved by her family and friends and her death had “emptied so many hearts.”\nHer friends set up a fundraising campaign in her name to help those in need: “We have to show humans chose peace and love, we must be the power of light in times of darkness. It keeps people together. This is the legacy of Dorin, all the light she brought to so many people,” said Saban.\nHer friend Dor Krimhant wrote on Instagram that he had “so many things to say about Dorini — the way she eats from the side of her mouth or how she walks in any space like she owned it, or how she answers the phone in a unique way to everyone, or the way she drives with her leg up, or how she sleeps curled up like a little fetus — but what will it help? Nobody can know her, nobody can be privileged to meet Doron Atias. No words will succeed in describing Dorin.”\n“Dorin is a color that doesn’t exist on the color spectrum, she is a human who is like no other, she is tough on the outside but inside she is all feeling, she has the biggest heart I’ve ever met and she taught me what it was to love unconditionally,” he wrote.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

The burial took place under heavy security and cover of darkness since the kibbutz was evacuated amid the war.\nYuval, who worked in real estate, was remembered as a huge animal lover, a big fan of Hapoel Tel Aviv with a joy for life and cynical sense of humor.\nHis father, Shabtay, wrote on Facebook that “a heavy loss has fallen on me and my beloved family with the death of my firstborn son, Yuval, on Saturday when he was called to reserves.”\nShabtay wrote that “the heavens have fallen upon us and on the family, both close and extended. Yuval was our beloved son, respectful, moral, an athlete, a fan, a special person whose great qualities cannot be described in words.”\n“Our Yuval is here no longer, and his death has numbed my two hands, if only I could have gone instead of him,” his father continued. “I will be strong only for those close to me… our lives will never be the same.”\nHis cousin, Cochi Mizrachi, recalled on Facebook visiting Yuval and his family on the kibbutz during their childhood, which was “like the Garden of Eden.”\n“Since the news that you were killed, we, the entire extended Gabay family are in shock, in a nightmare. Your parents Milka and Shabtay are shattered, and Tair your girlfriend of 15 years, is destroyed. Your sister Yael and your brother Alon cannot find any peace,” she wrote. “I will never forget you. Never.”\nAt his funeral, his brother, Alon Gabay, said, “I loved being your younger brother, so close in age, different from you and similar to you. I enjoyed our constant competition: Who was better at sports, who looked better, who was physically stronger.”\n“Here at your funeral, I am ready to admit — you were definitely the stronger one,” he said. “But don’t get too excited — over the past week, I have been called Yuval a number of times. Quite a few people told me that I laugh, move and act like you. I was so happy to hear that, because perhaps it means that something of you has remained with us, with me.”\nYuval’s girlfriend, Tair Dinur, wrote on Facebook that he “was everything to me, the light and the joy in my life. I don’t have the words to describe the enormity of the loss. I can’t live without you, I can’t breathe without you. How can I continue living without my other half? Your love was the source of my life.”\nAfter their 15 years together, she wrote, “I can’t find the words to part from you because I do not want to part from you, I am not ready to part from you. There’s so much more that I want to say to you, please come back. Just tell me it was all a mistake. I’m not whole without you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Amir and Mati Weiss, both 69, were murdered by Hamas terrorists inside their home in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7.\nAmir’s brother, sister-in-law and niece, Ilan, Shira and Noga, went missing from Be’eri the same day; Shira and Noga were taken captive by Hamas freed on November 25, while Ilan was declared dead on January 1, after close to three months.\nThey are survived by their four children, Ran, Michal, Yuval and Oren, and 10 grandchildren — who all lived in Be’eri. The couple was laid to rest on October 20 in Kibbutz Revivim. Ten days later, the family decided to go ahead with Oren’s wedding to his wife, Mirit, mixing the family’s pain with joy.\nTheir son, Ran, told Ynet that during the last conversation he had with his mother, she said that his father had been shot and there were terrorists in the house throwing grenades against the door of their safe room. “I worried that it was my last conversation with her,” he said. Shortly afterward she sent two voice messages shouting for help.\nIn a separate conversation with their son Yuval, Mati said she was wounded and Yuval tried to reassure her that she would survive: “I don’t think so, I think we are parting ways… My dear, tell everyone I loved them very much.”\nIn one of Mati’s final Facebook posts, ahead of Rosh Hashana, just a few weeks before she was killed, Mati wrote that in the spirit of the new year, “I am asking to remind us that we only live twice: The second time is when we understand that we only live once. I wish for all of us to enjoy, to live, to love, to be present in the beautiful moments and to internalize them.”\nAccording to a eulogy posted on the kibbutz website, the couple met when Mati was working in the Eilat airport and Amir was working as a security agent for the Arkia airline in Eilat. They married in 1977 and settled in the kibbutz in 1985, and never left.\nMati was a lifelong educator, who taught and later served as a principal in the local school and also helped develop national curricula and later worked as an adviser to other principals: “Mati was a natural leader and everywhere she went she became a leader, an initiator and a meaningful figure,” the kibbutz eulogy reads.\nHer former coworker Alon Gayer wrote on Facebook that Mati had a “magnificent public career” in education, and they formed a friendship because it “was impossible not to be Mati’s friend. She had bright and smart eyes, a management approach of partnership, a humanity that was not afraid of assertiveness and above all a wisdom and a deep and well-rounded perception of life.”\nHer friend Yael Weis described Mati as “fire and ice, energetic, purposeful, ambitious, full of life, embracing and warm — the phrase which most defines her in my eyes is ‘the head of the tribe.’ She had the ability to connect people and to cause them to feel connected and a sense of belonging. She did so with her family, with the people she worked with, and also with us, her oldest friends.”\nAmir and Mati Weiss on a trip to Japan in 2019. (Facebook)\nAmir worked for many years in agriculture, and later in the local Be’eri printing house. He was also known for his musical talents, the kibbutz said. “Though they were different from each other — he was quiet and introverted, she was energetic and active — they completed each other and did everything together… They both loved nature, views and the wide open spaces of the Negev,” the eulogy reads.\n“He had an incredible voice, he would sing at all the ceremonies on the kibbutz,” their son, Ran Weiss, told Channel 12 news. “He was always singing.”\nAt an event marking 50 years since the Yom Kippur war — during which he served — just two weeks before he was murdered, Amir sang in a ceremony at the kibbutz, performing “Wheat Grows Again,” a song written in the aftermath of the war and popularized by Chava Alberstein.\nJust a month later, their children Ran and Michal sang the song together at a memorial ceremony, with the lyrics taking on new meaning: “This is not the same valley/ This is not the same house/ You are all gone and you cannot return.”\nTheir daughter, Michal Weiss Pinyan, told Channel 12 news that her father was “not a big talker. He didn’t share a lot of his thoughts, his feelings… but when he got on stage, people opened up, he had such a pleasant voice.”\nTheir son-in-law, Lotan Pinyan, wrote on Facebook that Amir had a “connection to the land and the place, with no filters and no allusions, straight and to the point yet gentle, calm and peaceful, instilled with warmth and pleasantness.”\nHe was “a man of the land and the printing house, and Mati was an educator and a woman of the community, true Zionists, grandparents at 150% capacity, people with good, generous hearts. I miss them so much.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Around 30 minutes later, he called her again and said, “‘Mom, there is a lot of gunfire, rockets sirens, we evacuated two really wounded people, I made a tourniquet,’ and he hung up.

As he later ran for his car, “I saw Dvir in the area of the party running with a stretcher evacuating a friend of his.” Sahar tried to convince him to get in his car, and he replied “I can’t, I have another friend in there.”\nAt 8:42 a.m., he wrote his final text message in the family WhatsApp group: “If I don’t make it out of this alive, know that I love you to no end.

He always loved to help. He spread love and accepted everything with joy and goodheartedness.”\nHis mother Hagit told Ynet that her son wanted to study psychology “so he could help others. ‘Be the light you want to see in others,’ was the sentence that accompanied him,” she said. “He said it to us, to his friends, to his little brothers. His hugs were the strongest and warmest in the world. He always showered others with love. Every time he entered a room, he created light around him.”\nHagit said Dvir “was not only my oldest son, but my closest friend. We told each other everything… We used to do everything together as a family. Since that day we feel like one huge rift. I feel like my heart has been uprooted.

You believed that people are naturally good — the truth is that the world smiled at you and you smiled back.”\n“At the base of your beliefs about the world was the knowledge that it was OK to want, to hope, it was OK to wish — the cynicism of life these days did not stop you from believing in the power of hope.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He is survived by his mother, Chava, and eight of his siblings: Shira, Netanel, Yehoshua, Miriam, Orit, Tehilla, Rinat and Esther.\nIn 2016, when he was 15, he witnessed his father, Rabbi Miki Mark, be murdered in a drive-by terror shooting in the southern West Bank. He was lightly wounded and his mother and sister were seriously wounded but survived.\nHis older brother, Shlomi, was killed in a motorcyle accident in 2019. Pedayah’s cousin, Capt. Elhanan Kalmanson, was killed on October 8 fighting Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Be’eri.\n“It’s inexplicable pain,” his sister, Orit Mark-Ettinger, told Ynet. “We couldn’t believe that this happened to us again. That we were in the same situation again… I now don’t have three people from my closest and most personal family. I don’t have my father and he won’t come back. I don’t have my eldest brother and he won’t come back. And I don’t have my younger brother and he won’t come back.”\n“He ws a good and loving brother,” she told the news site. “He was my little brother, but he made us feel safe. He would hug us and give us this feeling that, Pedushka is here, you can calm down.”\nDespite the family’s heavy losses, she said, there was no question he would enlist in a combat unit when the time came: “Pedayah always thought about the army, his dream was to enlist, to command, to lead. All of his life Pedayah was a leader. That’s who he was.”\nHis brother, Yehoshua Mark, told Walla that he remembered Pedayah doing situps in the living room when he was 7 years old to prepare for enlisting in the military: “This shows what kind of hero and military guy he was. But there was also a lot of sweetness under the scary warrior, or on top of it, there was an indescribable ball of heart and sweetness. It’s important to remember that every soldier, every hero, is ultimately a brother and a little boy who has a lot of people who loved him and he is important to them and is an inseparable part of them.”\nHis sister, Shira Mark, said she saw her little brother as a hero long before he fell in battle: “He was a hero because he succeeded in living a life full of meaning, full of resilience, full of strength and full of choices. I feel that despite the third death in our family, we didn’t lose, there is a victory, because Pedayah fought out of love not out of hate… I feel like what I learned from Pedayah wasn’t on the battlefield but in the day-to-day. Every day he lived his silence and his strength.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Daniel Asher Cohen, 32, from Tel Aviv, was murdered at the Psyduck music festival near Nirim on October 7.\nCohen, a DJ who went by the stage name Nisha, was playing on stage at the small festival shortly before the Hamas onslaught began early Saturday morning.\nHis close friend, Shira Mor, told an independent news site that Cohen and another friend fled the festival in their car when the rockets began, and were shot at by terrorists on the road. They were both wounded, and the friend stopped the car and fled as the terrorists approached, escaping alive. Cohen was never heard from again.\nHe was buried on October 10 at the Yarkon Cemetery in Petah Tikva.\nHe is survived by his mother Orna and sister Talya. He was predeceased by his father, Tsion.\nAfter 52 days of searching, his family was finally able to track down video footage of his final ever DJ set at the party, recovered from the phone of a partygoer who was also murdered that day.\nRoy Zinger, a festival and music producer who worked with Cohen, told Ynet that he was a “trance music creator who combined the modern and old school worlds. He had an incredible passion for it, his music was very joyous. Every time I listened to his music there would be a smile on my face.”\nHis friend Aviv Cohen told Haaretz that the two of them “sat for many hours in the studio together, jamming. We played music we wrote for each other, and our progress went hand in hand. He was in a good period of growth and creativity. He was really happy to start recording, to play original music in an open place, and happy to be with people he loved. He was really excited about the festival. You could say that he was fulfilled until his very last moment.”\nDaniel’s uncle, Rafi Cohen, memorialized his nephew on Facebook, as “the quiet boy, the beautiful boy, the boy who was an officer in the army. The boy who traveled in the forests of South America, the boy who toured for months in villages in India. The boy who did only good. The boy who went to make people happy at a party. This boy — monsters murdered in cold blood.”\nMother Orna told Haaretz that her son always had a love for music, but in high school, he also “learned computers and biology, and wanted to become a biologist.”\nShe said he served in the army as a “battalion liaison officer and did a lot of reserve duty. I never understood why he liked doing reserve duty so much, but his friends who came to the shiva [mourning period] told me how much he loved it and about the music he would bring.”\nOrna told Haaretz that his family wasn’t super enthusiastic about his chosen field, but supported him when he started studying music: “In recent years, what interested him were friends, music and the Florentin neighborhood in Tel Aviv where he lived. A lot of friends who play music came to the shiva. Even when he was a student, I would always go and hear him play – but now my heart aches that I wasn’t prouder of him and more vocal about it at the time.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Marina Losev, 60, and her husband Igor Losev, 58, were murdered by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Beeri on October 7.\nThe couple, natives of Ukraine, were married for 35 years, and lived for almost three decades in the kibbutz.\nThey are survived by their only daughter Katya, son-in-law Dima and granddaughter Kira.\nKatya said she spoke to them on that Saturday morning, and Marina whispered that terrorists had entered their home. But at 10 a.m., the connection was lost. A week later, she was informed of their deaths.\nAn internment ceremony was held on November 9 at a hotel near the Dead Sea where kibbutz residents were evacuated.\nAccording to a eulogy on the kibbutz website, Marina and Igor were both born in Zaporizhzhia, on the banks of the Dnieper River in Ukraine. They married in April 1988 and Katya was born a year later. When the USSR started falling apart, Igor and Marina decided to immigrate to Israel, inspired by the possibility of living in the secular and socialist environment of a kibbutz.\nLeaving their families and friends behind, the three immigrated to Israel in October 1994, moving into a caravan that was waiting for them at Kibbutz Be’eri. Marina worked at the printing press of the kibbutz, loved reading — especially detective novels — and loved looking after the plants at her home, her cats and stray cats. Igor started as a dishwasher at the kibbutz and then moved on to work at the printing house. He carefully tended the mango and citrus trees he planted in the yard of their home, the eulogy read.\nIn a statement shared by the kibbutz, Katya said that because she was an only child, Marina tended to be overly protective.\n“At every stage of my life she helped me, and I could trust her,” she said. “There is no one who did not receive her discreet and devoted care. Everyone knew she could be trusted.”\nHer father, Katya said, was an introvert, a quiet man who made good friends with his co-workers. He loved life in the kibbutz, but he also missed Russian culture. He and Katya used to watch Russian-dubbed cartoons together. He loved to work with his hands and repair things. Both her parents instilled in her a love for studies and a will to succeed, she said.\n“We were a small family, and now we are even a smaller one,” Katya said. “Now the kibbutz will be my family, and that of Kira and Dima.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Itay Saadon, 21, was killed in combat in the northern Gaza Strip on November 2, 2023.\nA tank commander in the 401st Armored Brigade’s 52nd Battalion, Saadon was slated for discharge this year on November 15. He had already bought plane tickets for a vacation with his friends in Berlin before Hamas’s devastating attack on October 7 upended his plans to go abroad.\nAgainst his parents’ wishes, Saadon canceled his flight to Europe and instead volunteered to stay at his base that Saturday.\n“How many times have I told him, ‘We don’t volunteer on Shabbat for the army,’” tweeted Itay’s father Eyal when his son went into battle on October 7. “I thought, at least he’s in the north, far from all the chaos.”\nEyal Saadon continued to tweet about his son as the war continued into its first month, trying to envision a future where they would reunite as a family.\n“I save every picture and video of a tank published by an IDF spokesperson,” he tweeted on October 31. “I’m waiting for him to come back, for us to sit together and for him to tell us that here is his tank and here is their shell. In the meantime, I keep everything inside and keep myself as strong as possible.”\nTwo days later, Itay fell in combat in the northern Gaza Strip.\nEyal tweeted the day of his son’s death: “I’m sitting next to my ex-wife with our daughter who returned from a vacation. A knock on the door, I tense up, my ex-wife goes to the door, she glances and says, ‘No, it’s a mistake.’ A few moments and we realize the tension is killing us and we both cry together. We calm down, assure ourselves that he will return and his plan abroad will still play out.”\nAlthough his family moved to Tel Aviv three years ago, the slain soldier was laid to rest in Misgav, the regional council for Har Halutz, a small village in the Galilee where Saadon grew up. The funeral took place on November 5.\n“His biggest dream was to be a pilot,” his mother Liat said at her son’s funeral. “He was due to be released on November 15, he was planning to go to Canada to learn to fly. He was busy fulfilling his dream from the age of five. I can’t stop thinking that he is in heaven. From age five he had a dream, and he was not able to fulfill it.”\nHis mother recalled the last conversation she had with her son in Kiryat Gat, a week before his death.\n“He was a tank commander like his grandfather, who fought in the Yom Kippur War. We laughed that he would be like grandfather. That he would continue his legacy and take us to the places where he served and fought,” she said.\n“Itay said that he wanted to continue to live there and raise his children there [in Har Halutz],” his father said in his eulogy.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Her sister told Channel 12 news that her father went down to the front lines to look for her when the IDF was still battling terrorists: “He pushed his way through, he said ‘shoot me, I don’t care, I’m looking for my daughter.'”\nAfter two weeks, the news came — her body had been found.\nShe was buried on October 22 in Rishon Lezion. She is survived by her parents, Tatiana and Gocha, a sister, Mary, two nieces and her boyfriend, Lior.\nHer sister, Mary Lobaton, described her on Facebook as “always living in the moment. You didn’t care about anything materialistic, you never gave things like that any value… You did what you wanted and what felt right. You didn’t think too much, you just did — shopping, singing, dancing, going out, drinking, smoking, getting high, wasting money on nonsense.”\nLobaton said she and her sister were always very different: “You were the crazy one, I was the calm one; you were late, I was on time; you loved sunrises, I sunsets; you were warm, I’m cold; you were spiritual, I’m realistic; you were a rebel, I am obedient. You were you and I was me. And now I feel like there is a lot of you in me.”\nHer boyfriend, Lior Somantia, wrote that during their 6.5 years together, “We had our ups and downs but we always found ourselves together again laughing about everything. You are the most unique person I’ve ever met in this world… Your smile is now spread around heaven.”\nHe wrote that everything now reminds him of Tamar, “Every song, every laugh, every TV show, every item of clothing, every item, every photo — even if you’re not really in it,” he wrote. “Six and a half years and there wasn’t anything we didn’t do together, there was nothing we didn’t experience together, you always laughed that we were together more than a quarter of your life.”\n“I was sure and I believed that I could protect and defend you all my life, I was sure that we would get married. I can’t believe that now you will watch over me from there,” he wrote. “My love for you was endless and it will be endless forever.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Daniel Kastiel, 24, a Maglan soldier from Beit Shemesh, was killed battling Hamas terrorists on the Zikim Beach on October 11.\nHe was buried on October 13 in the military section of the Beit Shemesh cemetery. He is survived by his parents, Vivian and Yehuda, and four brothers, Yehonatan, David, Michael and Raziel, as well as his girlfriend, Maya.\nHis family told Israel Hayom that “Daniel was a great person. He always sought the success of his brothers, his family and his parents. He was very modest and always concerned with the success of everyone.”\nThe final voice notes and messages Kastiel sent to his loved ones in the days before his death have taken on new resonance after he was killed.\n“Razi, what’s up my man, listen, again I’m reminding you to stay focused,” Daniel said in a voice note to his brother, Raziel, who is also serving in an IDF combat unit, not long before his death. “Don’t tell people what’s going on, what the situation is, who’s dead. Whoever dies is dead, it’s over, and you move on. Raise the spirits of your friends, have high morale, be sharp. Eyes up high, no phone, no Instagram, no-nonsense. You’re focused, finger on the trigger, eyes up.”\n“Got it?” he continued. “Don’t focus on what was and what will be and don’t listen to stories, don’t watch videos, it’s not good for the soul. Look at my crew, everyone is locked down, everyone is happy, everyone is smiling, and nobody even turns their phones on at all. We’re ready, and you have to be ready too — you understand?… Take care of yourself.”\nHis brother, Michael, told Channel 14 that the last time he saw Daniel alive was on Simhat Torah morning, October 7, “when he got an aliyah during Torah reading when he was already in IDF uniform, his car was waiting outside, he wrapped himself in a tallit, read the [blessings] and went. That’s the last time we saw him.”\nThat memory is one of the reasons, Michael said, that the family is raising funds to dedicate a Torah scroll in his honor.\nKastiel’s cousin, Noa Tuizer, wrote on Instagram that “Daniel was a lover of people, who loved the land, a beautiful child, modest, respectful and incredibly funny. He always had a smile on his face and contagious joy for life. He had so many dreams and aspirations for the future. You will stay in our hearts forever Daniel.”\nHis girlfriend, Maya Elbaz, told Ma’ariv that when she received the news that he had been killed, she could not come to accept what had happened.\n“I said that it wasn’t logical, that there was no way it happened,” she recounted. “It was in Daniel’s nature to charge ahead, I knew that if something had happened he would be the first to attack. Every time he had reserve duty he couldn’t wait to go,” she said.\n“He had so many plans, aspirations, he worked for the water authority in Beit Shemesh, he wanted a family, he wanted kids, he wanted to get married,” she said. “He volunteered at a soup kitchen. All of his dreams, all of his aspirations, in one second, were gone.”\nShe publicized their final text messages, shortly before he was killed, and they were turned into a song titled “The Last Conversation” by singer Adir Getz.\n“Our nation is the most beautiful in the world,” he wrote to her. “So many good people, the salt of the earth, are dying in battle, it’s unbelievable… Pray for those wounded.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Amit Gabay, 17, from Kibbutz Re’im, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in his home on October 7.\nGabay was staying in the youth housing section of the kibbutz when the rocket air raid sirens began and residents quickly realized terrorists had also infiltrated the kibbutz. His family, who was in its own home nearby, told him to stay in his safe room and not leave. He last sent them a message at 8:10 a.m. and was last seen on WhatsApp at 8:17 a.m.\nThe next morning the family was informed that he had been killed.\nHe is survived by his parents, Adi and Noam, and younger siblings Ofri and Omer. His family said he loved rap music and traveling with his friends, and was excited to be living on his own in the kibbutz’s youth wing.\nHis close friend, Liam Or, was kidnapped that same day, and freed on November 29. After he was released, he found out that Gabay had been killed.\n“Gabay, my brother, we’ve been neighbors and best friends since age 0,” Or wrote on social media. “You accompanied me my entire life, from the baby house to kindergarten, school, high school, we were always brothers, there’s no other word. You were the perfect partner, for the first [cigarette] puff, for all of the trips in nature and the outdoor coffee brewing we would do all the time.”\nOr said he recalled that one day “at 6 p.m. I invited you to fly with me to a Hapoel game in Barcelona and at 1 a.m. we were already on the way to the airport.” He wrote that ever since he returned from captivity, “I think only about you. I know that you watched over me. I dreamed about you a lot and our memories gave me the strength to keep going and to believe. You are the angel who protected me and I know you will keep protecting me my entire life.”\nOn October 28, on what would have been his 18th birthday, his mother, Adi Gabay Rosenzweig, wrote on Facebook: “Today 18 years ago you turned us into parents, and thanks to you we received the title Mom and Dad. Today 18 years ago my heart learned what unconditional love was. Today 18 years ago you were born,” she recounted.\n“But today I don’t have anyone to arrange a plate of goodies for. Today I don’t have anyone to decorate the house with balloons for. Today my heart hurts, hurts deeply.”\nHis grandfather, Simcha Gabay, wrote on Facebook that Amit was “a delightful child, a loving and beloved boy. My friends on Kibbutz Re’im will no longer say to me ‘What a grandson you have, your Amit, says hi to everyone, asks about them,’ because Amit will no longer smile at anyone. We will no longer see Amit enter the cafeteria with his captivating smile, we won’t see Amit on the pathways of the kibbutz. Amit will no longer ask to borrow the electric scooter, he’ll no longer ask for me to drive him somewhere… Amit always said he would either be a farmer or an educator, but none of that will be any longer, his dreams and his travels abroad, the party for his 18th birthday in the commune with all his friends. No, Amit will forever stay 18 minus 22 days.”\nAmit’s father, Noam, wrote on Facebook a little over a month after his death that “as time passes it gets even harder. Can you call from wherever you are? Can you walk around there barefoot? Did you meet Yaron [Shahar who was also killed]? You forgot your coffee machine and your speaker, how will you manage?\n“Call me and we’ll talk about new songs by [rappers] Jimbo, Peled and others. Play me new things and I’ll introduce you to new and interesting beers. It’s not fair that you didn’t get to enjoy your room in the youth wing that you were so looking forward to. I only just finished building the pergola so you could invite all your friends to hang out,” his father continued.\n“Your smile and your wide heart are missing for me in the kibbutz. Your murder is a huge loss for the world. And maybe this screwed-up world is not worthy of you being here… I tried to call you and you didn’t answer. I’ll try again tomorrow.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Ayelet Godard, 63, and husband Manny Godard, 73, were murdered by Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists in their home in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7. Manny’s body was taken captive to Gaza.\nAyelet called one of their children that Saturday morning screaming that Manny had been killed and she was hiding in the bushes from the terrorists. She was never heard from again, and her body was found some time later.\nA funeral for the couple was held on October 29 in Palmahim. However, Kibbutz Be’eri announced on February 8, 2024, that Manny’s body was being held in Gaza.\nThe couple are survived by their children, Mor, Gal, Bar and Goni, a number of grandchildren and several siblings.\nA eulogy posted on the kibbutz website remembered Ayelet as a longtime educator, “a special teacher, one of days gone by, the kind who brought nature into the classroom and took the children outside,” and shaped so many of the youth who grew up in the kibbutz and nearby. She was an “incredible mother and a revered grandmother,” who also “believed with all her heart in the kibbutz and its members, and was an active part of the kibbutz life.”\nManny, the kibbutz eulogized, had “a love of sports, the ocean and people.” He was a professional soccer player in the 1970s before enlisting in the army and fighting in the Yom Kippur War. In the kibbutz, he worked in a variety of positions, including in the printing house, the local kibbutz store, the chief economist, and always where his heart lay — as a lifeguard.\nTheir son Goni wrote on Facebook that they were “people with a special heart of gold which entered inside everyone in the world. Everyone wanted to say thank you — thank you for all the years that you hugged us and loved us. Thank you for the endless support and help. Thank you for all the experiences we had with you… the list doesn’t end.”\n“These are the people you were — people who spread light in every direction, people of people, thank you for everything,” he wrote. “You will always, always no matter what be an inseparable part of us.”\nTheir daughter, Mor Godard, wrote on Facebook that she struggled to find the words for their eulogy, and could no longer call them to ask for help.\n“Now, there is nobody to ask, there is no flashlight illuminating the way, there is no way,” she wrote. “There is great darkness, there is fear and there is longing.”\nMor described her father as “the anchor in our lives, our guy, who was always there to rely on. The one who would pick us up from youth parties in the middle of the night, send us money to India because we spent too much, who was always the first in every kindergarten classroom and every class when the grandchildren had their birthdays.”\nHer mother, she wrote, “was always my first telephone call in the morning and my last at the end of the day — 20 times a day I want to call you and I can’t. You were everything to me, the one I always sought advice from on everything from big to small… You always listened, strengthened, defended and also offered solutions.”\nMor wrote, “I am sure that if there is a place up above, you are sitting together, laughing, talking, bringing up memories, and proud that we all survived. That you sacrificed your lives so that we would make it out of that horror alive. Mom and Dad, I want you to know that we are strong, we are together, we are taking care of each other, supporting, embracing, there for each other without limitation, just like you taught us, just like you raised us.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Matan ‘Kido’ Elmalem, 42, was killed at the Supernova festival at Kibbutz Re’im after playing what would be his last set on the DJ stage at the outdoor music festival on October 7, 2023.\nOriginally from the desert town of Dimona, Elmalem was a music-lover from an early age, blasting Guns N’ Roses and Metallica from his childhood bedroom, and later becoming a sought-after teen DJ at school events and high school parties in the small town.\nAs his music career grew, Elmalem adopted the professional name DJ Kido and traveled the world, playing at top music festivals and events in Europe, India, South America, and Japan, which he called home for about a year.\nHe was at the height of his career, a talented and beloved world-famous DJ and legend in the trance music scene in Israel and abroad, family and friends say.\nEarly Saturday morning on October 7, Elmalem was at the helm of one of several stages at the massive trance event, which drew an overall crowd of some 3,500 people. Terrorists killed about one out of every 10 people at the event during the massacre at Supernova and abducted some two dozen.\nElmalem was initially listed as missing before his body was found by friends who went looking for him at the festival.\n“Your friends didn’t stop the search, they went with the permission of the brigade commander, crawled on the floor for miles at night, and found your bag and your car, your personal equipment, but not your phone. The next day they came back and went over the whole area again — no army, no police, no ZAKA, only them. And they found your phone, your ring, and next to these, your body. My son, my love, watch over the family,” his father Shimon Elmalem said in his eulogy.\nElmalem’s sister, Lyn Elmalem, said that at his funeral, which drew hundreds, people would come up to the family and tell them of Elmalem’s heroics that devastating morning.\nOne man who was at the event told Lyn that there were partygoers who were under the influence of substances “and Matan brought them to a safe place, calmed them down and helped them leave the area.”\n“He returned to help more people. This is what typifies him best. He always said about people in distress, ‘And what if she were my little sister?’ And it caused him to be very sensitive,” she said.\nLyn described a loving, doting older brother for whom music was life and who became a powerhouse in the trance genre.\n“He fought for trance. I didn’t understand this music and didn’t understand what they enjoy about it, but he tried to explain to me that there’s meaning behind it and that it’s an entire world that needs to be studied,” she said.\nOmri Elmalem, his younger brother, also described the joy of being his sibling.\n“My Matani, ever since I can remember I know that I have an older brother who watches over me… There was always someone who said, ‘Are you Kido’s brother? Wow, you look alike.’ Then they start with the stories, about a party you were at together, or a production. They always mention how special a person you are, how much they love you, even if you haven’t spoken in a decade,” he said at the funeral.\nFriend and mentor Mikko Barak paid tribute to Elmalem in a Facebook post, recalling his first meeting with the young, ambitious DJ many years ago and their music journey together since.\n“My Kido, my child, I’ve been trying to find the words but I can’t, I don’t know how to say goodbye, I can’t find sense in the words I’m writing… My head refuses to grasp that you’re not here anymore, and my heart explodes with pain,” said Barak. “You left a mark on everyone you touched in the short time you had to live.”\nGal Amos, who goes by the stage name DJ Galapagos, was a long-time music partner of Elmalem’s. He told Channel 12: “Matan is one of the best people I have ever met in my life. A huge heart of giving and an entire scene got to experience this colorful human being who was an integral part of the DNA of global trance culture. He had a special charm.”\nAmos said Elmalem was that friend who always brought people together: “The Friday dinners at his house, he made sure to gather everyone and that everyone would take part… The new generation may not know, but Matan was a big name in the world.”\n“He always said: ‘I am trance,’” recalled Dan Label, the artistic director of the Forum Club in Beersheba, who worked closely with Elmalem over the past two years. “It was his life. A true professional, he treated every evening he managed as if it were an Independence Day celebration. He was punctilious about time and hospitality for the artists to the highest level. Trance artists from around the world knew it wasn’t just about coming and playing –- it was being a guest of Kido.”\nAs a DJ, Elmalem was “an encyclopedia of trance,” Label said. “He was the best.”\n“All of the life stories we wrote together, I will take with me forever. Rest in peace, my dear brother. See you at the big party in the sky,” Amos bid Elmalem in farewell.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

In our last conversation on that terrible Saturday, you were afraid and I didn’t succeed in calming you down. For that, I ask forgiveness, my beloved sister.”\nAdir’s brother, Yogev Tamam, described checking his phone every day “if by some chance you read my messages, but it still hasn’t happened. I want somebody to wake me up from this nightmare!!” While clearing out their apartment, Yogev wrote, “Every item that we pack is a reminder. The stories, the memories, everything in the past tense.”\nShiraz’s employer paid tribute to our “beloved receptionist who was an inseparable part of us for 12 years. Shiraz did everything, knew everything, but never wanted to take credit. Everything was done in a perfect way behind the scenes without her needing any applause. Shiraz was the stable and sane anchor of our office.”\nAdir’s brother, Shoval, wrote on Instagram that the couple “really loved the sea, loved taking trips with their girls… they loved love and they loved music festivals, they helped everyone with anything they could — they were people of love and peace.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She is survived by her parents, Zehava and Erez, and siblings Raz, Shahaf and Aviv — her twin.\nBen Simon was one of the senior commanders on duty at the Zikim training base when it was attacked by Hamas who went out to the front lines to fight the invasion and told all the young trainees on base to seek shelter, saving their lives. Six of the commanders, including Ben Simon, were killed in the battle, and all but one trainee emerged alive.\nAdar’s twin, Aviv, told Channel 12 news that initially on that Saturday morning “we were calm because she was in an IDF base. We didn’t know they would get to her as well.”\n“She wrote to us that she heard gunshots,” Aviv recounted. “Adar and the commanders made a decision to go out and fight, and sent all the trainees to the shelter. They didn’t get any such order from above, but they ordered the trainees to go to a protected place and went out to fight. She sacrificed her life like a hero and was a role model.”\nAviv told Channel 14 that his twin sister was “my best friend, we grew up together, we did everything together, she was my second half. She helped me with everything, nothing could separate us… She was the light of our family.”\nHer older brother, Raz, posted a video on Instagram describing her as “the backbone and the light of our family, your smile always radiated and lit up any darkness. We were four siblings whom others were always jealous of. We are a united, special and strong family, with perfect parents who raised children gloriously. We went through so much together, and we made sure to rack up magical and unforgettable experiences.

You were always the leader of everyone, the silly one who made everyone laugh, the first to help with anything that was needed. You always thought of everyone else before you thought of yourself… A hero of Israel, a hero of the family and my own personal hero.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Sahar was murdered in captivity, and the IDF confirmed his death on December 9; Hamas is still holding his body hostage.\nEdan and Sahar were survived by their parents, Tammy and Roni, and siblings Guy and Niv. Geula is survived by her husband, Yitzhak, five children — Yossi, Rivka, Tammy, Oved and Meirav — and 20 of her 22 grandchildren. Her daughter, Naomi, died in 1992 at age 22.\nEdan and Sahar were together at home when Hamas terrorists broke into their house, and threw grenades into their safe room, wounding Edan. The terrorists set their home on fire, and they climbed out the window to escape. Sahar went back to get an inhaler for Edan, who was asthmatic, and was captured, and Edan was shot dead.\nYitzhak, Geula’s husband and Edan and Sahar’s grandfather, told the Kan public radio that when the sirens first started, they went to their bomb shelter in their own home, but when they realized terrorists had infiltrated the kibbutz, they split up into different rooms to try and hide. When Yitzhak was eventually rescued, he discovered that Geula had been killed.\nEdan was an IDF soldier in the Education Corps who had only recently finished basic training. Sahar, who had recently returned from a long trip to South America, was slated to start studies in electrical engineering at Ben Gurion University in Beersheba.\nGeula and Yitzhak’s son, Maj. Gen. Yossi Bachar, who retired in 2018 after serving as the commander of the IDF’s General Staff Corps, told the Kan public broadcaster that he fought against the terrorists in Be’eri all day, killing at least 15 of them, before he went to find his family, and discovered his mother had been killed.\nA feeling of guilt that he couldn’t save her, “creeped in as I started to understand the situation. I wasn’t there for her in those moments.” But, added Bachar, who since October 7 has served as deputy commander of the Southern Command, “the intensity that I’m currently living in doesn’t allow me to take those thoughts to so many places — it’s an excellent escape mechanism.”\nAmid the war, he said, he managed to sit shiva for his mother for about half an hour total, “but it was important, because it gave me the oporutnity to tell those around me who that woman is, and what she did,” he said, declining to expand further, as he held back tears.\nMerav Barkai, Sahar’s aunt, described him to Ynet as “sharp, smart and realistic with a sense of humor, who was also an excellent chess player” and loved anime films and science fiction. The brothers, she said, were very close, and tried to protect each other on October 7.\nA memorial page set up for Edan said he was a member of the Noar HaOved youth group as a kid, and later became a youth leader in the group and was “devoted to education.” Before enlisting in the army, he spent a gap year doing national service at a therapeutic dog kennel.\nIlana Blumberg, whose daughter was serving with Edan in the IDF, said she told her that “Edan came back describ­ing ’Darom Adom,’ his plea­sure in the way the whole south turned to fields of red blos­soms in the sea­son of the anemone flow­ers. He told the group how much he loved his home on Kib­butz Be’eri, that it was where he want­ed to live always.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

During her funeral, mourners were informed that Shafir had also been found dead. He was buried the next day, on October 11 in Modiin.\nThe couple had been planning to get married next year, and to walk down the aisle to Kobi Aflalo’s “What the Heart Chooses.” Instead, Aflalo performed the song at Shafir’s funeral.\nShafir, a UK-Irish-Israeli citizen, is survived by his parents, Miryam and Itzik and three siblings. Kipper is survived by her parents Avi and Ricky and three siblings.\nShafir was a producer on the popular “Osim Historia” (Making History) network of podcasts until he left to continue such work independently. He fought in the reserves during Operation Protective Edge in 2014 and suffered from PTSD following his experiences. Shafir became an activist advocating for IDF veterans suffering from post-trauma.\nHis mother Miryam told Ynet that her son had a tattoo that read “Live the moment” in English: “Right now it’s hard for us, but we will choose to adopt this as a motto for life because that’s what Dor would have wanted.”\nDor Hanan Shafir (Courtesy)\nHis favorite food was the “Kariot” cereal with milk, which was in full supply for visitors during the shiva mourning week. Shafir’s tattoo, of a lion eating the popular Israeli cereal, was etched into the headstone of his grave. Several of his friends tattooed a bowl of cereal with “Dor” inscribed into the spoon on their ankles in tribute to him after his death.\nShafir’s sister, Ofek Shafir, wrote on Facebook that she wished “to be able to stop time for a moment, go back to the good and beautiful moments, to spend a little time there and give you tons of hugs. I hope that you know what a good person you were, and that you are Savyon are close together up above. You are the proof that despite the difficulties you can live the truth.”\nRan Levi, who worked with Shafir, reminisced about “long conversations with coffee and a cigarette on the wide balcony of the office, laughing in weekly staff meetings, joint moments in the studio, trying to debug annoying sound problems… Dor, you left and left behind a huge, gaping and bleeding hole. You were a professional above and beyond, and more than anything, you were a good friend, and a wonderful person.”\nSavyon Chen Kipper (Courtesy)\nKipper was an early education teacher in Tel Aviv who was studying visual communication at the Holon Institute of Technology, and was also a talented artist. Her final project was called “TELEKID,” and was an app to improve communication between parents and nursery teachers, and her classmates and family are hoping to complete it in her memory.\nHer friend Leoni Dahan wrote on Facebook reminiscing about their decade of friendship: “In all the important moments of my life you were there, you were always present.”\n“You were colorful, easygoing, always smiling, spontaneous and fun,” Dahan recalled. “You brought so much color and laughter into my life. You accompanied me through every meaningful moment, every turning point — you were there… I want everyone on earth to know that you were such a special person. Full of heart. Full of values.”\n“You took care of children for so many years with love and a sense of mission,” she added. “With an embrace and sensitivity… you were a child of nature, a wonderful and gentle soul, always smart, always willing to help anyone… you were a point of light, a ray of sunshine.”\nKipper’s friend Naama Regev wrote on LinkedIn about attending her funeral, which was interrupted several times by rocket sirens, and then by the news that Shafir had also been found dead: “Her sister shared the news over the loudspeaker, and we all fell apart even more. The couple who we thought we would dance at their wedding, are gone forever. And all I could think about was the very accurate timing — how the news came right before we buried Savion. Like she waited to hear what happened to him, to the love of her life.”\nStav Kipper, Savyon’s sister, said the couple met some years ago and then reconnected on a dating app a little more than a year ago. They “met for coffee, and were inseparable ever since. They had an overwhelming love and they felt very quickly that they had found their soulmate.

Everyone who met her described her mane of curls full of joy and good energy. She was a good daughter, a good sister, with a heart of gold and a strong affinity for education.”\nDor’s mother, Miryam, told Ynet that the couple “planned to get married and raise children together… at Dor’s funeral we felt that when he went up to heaven there was a huppa [wedding ceremony] taking place up above.

    "story": "Chief Superintendent Avi Amar, 54, from Otzem, a commander in the Israel Police Yoav Unit, was killed fighting Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7.\nHis loved ones said that when the air raid sirens began early Saturday morning, Amar headed straight to the front lines, fighting first in Sderot, then Kibbutz Kfar Aza, before heading to Be’eri, where he was slain.\nHis family said he kept them updated throughout the day, until he stopped answering around 2 p.m. A week later, his body was located and he was confirmed dead. He was buried on October 15 in Moshav Noga in the south.\nHe is survived by his wife Pazit and six children, ranging in age from 22 to 7, as well as his parents, Chana and Yisrael, and 10 siblings. His family described him as a dedicated family man, who loved nature and the outdoors and particularly horseback riding.\nThe final photo taken of Amar on October 7 showed him kneeling and embracing a distraught IDF soldier overwhelmed by the sights of the Hamas onslaught in Kibbutz Kfar Aza.\n“We don’t have any idea who took the photo, they just made sure it got to us,” Amar’s brother, Lior Amar, told Ynet. “The photo was taken about an hour before he was killed in Kibbutz Be’eri. The final photo of Avi encapsulates exactly who Avi was, a warrior who we lost.”\nChief Superintendent Avi Amar comforting a distraught IDF soldier near Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7, 2023, hours before he was killed. (Used in accordance with clause 27a of the copyright law)\nLior said that the photo shows “on the one hand, he is embracing and hugging strongly the IDF soldier who was experiencing shell shock, and on the other hand there is a lot of tenderness. I see in this photo my brother Avi who was full of heart, who provided a moment of calm to an IDF fighter, amid all the chaos and the gunfire of terrorists on that black Saturday.”\nA police official, identified only as M., told Ynet that he witnessed the photo being taken: “In the middle of the fighting, a soldier came to us from inside Kfar Aza and started crying, and Avi immediately got down on the road, hugged him and told him: ‘Don’t worry, we’ll get through this, I’m protecting you.'”\nAnother officer said that amidst the fighting that day when the officers were in desperate need of water, he entered an abandoned gas station, grabbed bottles of water and called the owner to ask him to charge him for six bottles: “This is what characterized Avi. He was determined to rescue officers and civilians and amid all of the horrors he did not give up and kept his cool and his humanity until he was killed.”\nAmar’s son, Magen David Adom paramedic Itay Amar, also headed out to save lives on that Saturday morning. He told a local Ashdod news outlet that he continued to work all week while his father was considered missing to treat those wounded in the attack and the fighting: “I know that Dad would be proud of me for the lives I saved on that terrible Saturday, and I am the most proud of him in the world for those he saved.”\nHis daughter, Stav Amar, told Ynet that during the shiva mourning period, “so many police officers came and told stories of his bravery, of the kind of guy he was.” When they received that final photo, “We stopped breathing because we know that hug so well, we know how it feels… I’ve been in that hug dozens of times, you’re not afraid of anything in that hug.”\nStav said the family feels lucky that he “left us six siblings strong. That was his life’s work, to ensure we were united and loving and together, so we are together in the good times and together in the difficult times.”\nShe said there are “so many stories of his bravery and his fighting but I want people to know, that in addition to that tough facade, he was an incredible and sensitive and loving father, and the first to help, and the first to give advice, and I will miss his hug forever.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Maxim Rizkov, 30, from Beersheba, a Border Police officer in the West Bank, was killed during a military operation in Tulkarem on October 19.\nHe was fatally wounded by an improvised explosive device that was hurled at Border Police forces carrying out an arrest raid.\nHe is survived by his mother, Olga, sister Alexandra (Sasha), his grandparents and his girlfriend, Yuval. His father, Konstantin, predeceased him.\nBorn in Russia, he moved to Israel with his family when he was 3 years old. He was buried on October 20 in the military cemetery in Beersheba.\nRazinkov was best known for his appearance on the reality TV show “Ninja Israel,” in both the second and fifth seasons of the series, which showcases the strength and gymnastic prowess of its competitors.\nHis sister, Sasha, told a local Beersheba news site that they managed to access his phone after his death, hoping to find a letter of goodbye: “I didn’t find anything, and then I understood that Max didn’t think about the worst that could happen. He was always sure of himself, his friends, his team, the skills of his elite unit.”\nEvery time Max went to reserve duty, she said, “It was like he was going to summer camp. He would iron all his clothes and pack his bag. We always knew he was taking care of himself, he always told us everything was fine, ‘What could happen to me?’ he would say. He was an athlete, strong, fast, skilled, smart, what are the chances?”\nShortly before he was killed, she said, he visited her during a brief break, “We sat, talked, laughed and he even told me ‘how beautiful you have become.’… he was the most beautiful angel, peaceful and calm.”\nSasha said that after her brother’s death, she decided to join the Border Police — where she served during her mandatory IDF service — and continue in his path: “Max was always proud of me and told me once that I was a copycat. Everything he did, I would do after him. Once he took me to a climbing wall in Beersheba and I didn’t know how I could climb because I had long fingernails, so I went and cut them. I could never tell him no. I feel empty today and don’t have thoughts about anything, just him. I will continue to memorialize him in every possible way all of my life.”\nHis girlfriend, Yuval Yeruham, wrote on Instagram about the moment that she received a knock on the door informing her “that the love of my life, the best, the strongest, the fastest” was killed. “Since then I’m trying to accept that my hero has become the hero of an entire nation.”\n“Thank you for teaching me to always be the strongest, that you believed in me that I could do anything and get through anything,” she wrote. “Thank you for being the best friend in the world, my anchor, my safe place… you should know that you left behind an entire fleet of people who loved you deeply and truly.”\nThe explosion that killed him “may have only wounded you, but it sent shrapnel into the hearts of everyone who ever looked you in the eyes. You left all of us without enough words to describe what kind of person you were, and how much light you spread in this crazy world.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He is also survived by his parents, Pnina and Amotz, and siblings Adi, Lihel, Dan and Sahar, as well as two step-siblings, Omri and Ayelet. A third step-sibling, Chen Even, who lived next door to the Avni family, was also murdered on October 7 along with his wife, Rinat and two of their children, Alon and Ido.\nAvni was retroactively recognized as a fallen soldier with the rank of sergeant major in the reserves.\nAn obituary on the kibbutz website said that Avni ran his own business, “Hagigi,” in which he worked as an event designer and planner, in particular with the use of plants and flowers. He was always “go-with-the-flow and spontaneous… a unique man, incredibly creative. He always volunteered first to help and fulfill any request.”\nHis wife, Adi, wrote on Facebook that: “Hagi, the longing for you is unbearable. As the days pass, I feel the loss and the understanding that you’re not coming back, that it wasn’t a dream, it’s a nightmare.”\n“My comfort is our wonderful children,” she added. “In each one of them you left a different piece of yourself, and when they are all with me, I feel you. A broken heart is a whole heart. I’m sorry I didn’t say it enough: I love you.”\nHis son, Reef, posted on Instagram more than two months after his father’s death, recalling their trip together to Iceland just a week before the Hamas onslaught that took his life.\n“Dad always told me that it’s more important to rejoice over what you manage to do in life, than to be sad about what you miss out on,” wrote Reef. “We never imagined that this would be our last journey together, and I am so happy that we managed to have this crazy experience.”\nIn Iceland, he wrote, “we saw the most beautiful places in the world. Volcanoes, icebergs, waterfalls and even the northern lights. On October 6, we celebrated Dad’s 50th birthday at home, it was one of the happiest days of his life — night and day from what happened the very next day.”\nReef, a budding photographer, said that his father was “someone who spoke about death, he wasn’t afraid of it, he just knew it would come sometime. That helped him have as much fun as possible, with things that did good for him and the family. He always wanted to take part in as many experiences as possible, to do the most good for those around him and to enjoy life.”\n“Dad taught me many things that I will take with me for the rest of my life,” he continued. “One of them is that we get one chance to live here, and you have to take advantage of the good things. So despite the pain, I know that what he would want most was that I would keep doing what I love.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

On December 1, the IDF announced that Margalit had been killed and his body was being held in Gaza.\nThe military said it made its declaration “based on findings that were collected, and intelligence.” His daughter, Nili Margalit, 40, was also kidnapped on October 7, and was released from Hamas captivity on November 30.\nHe is survived by his wife, Daphna, children Noa, Danny and Nili and three grandchildren.\nLoved ones reported that Eliyahu Margalit left his home early that Saturday morning to feed his beloved horses in the kibbutz stable and that his horses were also taken along with him.\nMargalit was responsible for many years for the kibbutz’s cattle. In 2019, the business publication The Marker spoke to him about the beef industry and the kibbutz’s decision to shut down that branch in 2018 — a decision “which broke Churchill’s heart.”\nSivan Klingbail, the editor-in-chief of The Marker, who grew up on Nir Oz, described Margalit as “always wearing work clothes and boots, pulling a feed cart, tending to a sick calf — seven days a week.”\nKlingbail wrote that Margalit arrived on the kibbutz in 1969 with a youth group, and ever since then raised cattle, overseeing the herd’s expansion from around 50 calves to 5,500 a year at its peak.\nGilad Sharon, the son of late prime minister Ariel Sharon, wrote in Ynet about his decades-long friendship with Margalit, built after he took over his father’s ranch in the south.\n“We met years ago. He was the most prominent cattle breeder in the country, and we got the calves to start our herd from him,” wrote Sharon. “There was an instant connection. Despite the gap in our ages, we became soulmates. He knew I would do anything for him, and I knew it was mutual.”\nSharon said that aside from Margalit’s wife, “everyone called him Churchill. He wouldn’t even turn around if you called him by any other name.” Margalit was “something like a western Negev version of Zorba the Greek. Everyone was beguiled by the man who was nothing but love for animals and the innocent heart of a child inside a large frame with an unkempt beard.”\nHe wrote that Churchill died doing one of the things he loved most, feeding his beloved horses: “The whole kibbutz was in flames, with terrorists everywhere, and Churchill went to the stables instead of staying with Daphna and his granddaughter Romi in the secure room in their home. There he was slaughtered by the barbarians, next to the horses he loved. He just couldn’t let them go hungry.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Yarden was released on November 29 as part of a Qatari-brokered cease-fire deal which saw the release of 105 civilian captives. Carmel was murdered by Hamas in captivity and her body retrieved in September 2024.\nKinneret’s son, Alon, and his three-year-old daughter, Geffen, were also seized by terrorists, but were able to escape their captors and remained free.\nFrom text messages in the family WhatsApp group that were pieced together after the attack, the family understood that Kinneret had motioned to Eshel to stay hidden in the bathroom, where he happened to be when the terrorists burst into their house just before 7 am on October 7. He survived despite terrorists spraying their house with bullets and trying to set it alight.\nAfter being dragged from the house, Kinneret was seen in videos that surfaced in the days after the attack with her hands tied, walking alongside elderly residents being led by Hamas fighters through the kibbutz before they were shot.\nHer death was confirmed on December 16, and her family held a memorial service for her in the Jordan Valley, “to accompany her on her final journey.”\nBorn on Kibbutz Degania Bet, Kinneret was a dedicated teacher and tour guide who loved to travel and reveled in sharing that love with the people around her.\nA fellow member of Kibbutz Be’eri, Adi Zohar, described Kinneret as “a woman of values and an out-of-the-box thinker.”\n“I could speak to her about anything and most of all I loved it when she told me stories about the ‘old days,’ when she’d just moved to Be’eri,” Zohar added in a post on Facebook. “Kinneret loved to travel, to find new places in Israel and abroad. Every time they’d get back from a trip I’d be in awe of how much she loved to travel.”\nOn November 7, on what would have been her 68th birthday, Kinneret’s grandson Gil Dickmann, who has been a vocal advocate in the effort to secure the release of the hostages held in Gaza, dedicated a song to her on Army Radio.\nIsraelis with family members held abducted by Hamas terrorists in Gaza since October 7 attend a Knesset National Security Committee hearing, November 20, 2023.

When she wasn’t traveling she loved to sing,” he said in the dedication. “On her 60th birthday, we got together with all of her friends, and she printed a list of 50 songs and asked me to learn to play all of them on my guitar, so everyone could sing along. Songs from the ’50s and ’60s, from her childhood.”\nDickmann said that at her memorial service, the friends and family sang songs of peace. “I want to believe that we can still believe in our fellow man, in human beings.

In late November, everyone but Tal was released as part of a truce deal.\nHis sister-in-law, Lilach Kipnis and her husband Eviatar Kipnis were also murdered on October 7.\nAvshalom was buried on October 18 in the town of Omer in the south, where he grew up. He is also survived by his children, Yuval and Shaked, his mother Ruth and his brother Ronen.\nUntil 2018, he served as the CEO of the Kibbutz Economies Group, which concentrates the purchasing power of the kibbutz movement, and was an active philanthropist. His wife founded the Fair Planet NGO, which said it was “heartbroken” by news of his death: “Avshel, you were an inspiration, mentor and our dear friend. Rest in peace.”\nRachel Gur, who works with his daughter, Shaked, wrote on X that “Avshalom was a noted economist and a pillar of the kibbutz. A man full kindness and giving. He was a devout father and grandfather.”\nFormer Likud MK Keren Barak said that “Avshal was one of a kind, smart, professional and talented, who led the kibbutz overall and the Be’eri printing house specifically, to incredible economic achievements. A charismatic, captivating family man and incredible friend. I loved him so much, he was always there when I needed him, always.”\nGali Hartman, his sister-in-law, described Haran as “someone who everyone knows. Not only because of his job as the kibbutz secretary and the CEO of Mishkei Hakibbutzim, but mostly because he helps and touches everyone’s lives. Avshal makes time, uses his contacts and abilities to help and do good. He is the spine of our family.”\nShmulik Dudai, who worked with Haran for several years and remained friends, said he last heard from him about six weeks before October 7, when he called to offer his help with Dudai’s campaign for local council chief: “At the end, he said in his direct manner, ‘I’m here for you, whatever you need, I’ll help’… What a noble man, a true mensch!”\nAt his funeral, his son Yuval said he was “such a good father, you loved us and we loved you. I wanted to call you all week, but I have nobody to call.” He recalled sitting with him a few days before the attack “and discussing the family vacation. You were an inspiration for everything in my life. I am sure that you did everything you could to protect us.”\nIn her eulogy, his daughter Shaked said, “How do we part from the best father in the world? You always said that there was nothing you wouldn’t do for us. You were smart and loving, and touched the hearts of many.”\nIn December, comedian Jerry Seinfeld visited Be’eri and met with Yuval, touring the wreckage of his father’s home: “If my Dad could come back to life and see Seinfeld in his house, it would put a smile on his face.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She and Yossi were planning to get married in January. She had purchased her wedding dress just a few days before the party.\nLevi worked as a social worker in a high school in Bat Yam. She was attending the rave as a volunteer with the Elem-Youth in Distress organization, which set up camp at the festival to provide counseling and emotional support to anyone undergoing a mental health crisis. The group’s volunteers are known for always being on hand in their recognizable blue shirts, which read “Good Guy.”\nThere were nine Elem volunteers at the Supernova music festival near Re’im on the morning of October 7. Only six made it out alive.\nAlongside Levi, volunteers Yonatan Richter and Lior Hadad Atias were also murdered. Fellow volunteer Maayan Shenker Brownstein told the Kan public broadcaster that as she was trying to escape the volley of gunfire, “I saw Sigal, on the side of the road, not responding, with wounds.”\nThe organization recalled Levi as “fully dedicated to the youth, getting up for them in the morning and going to bed with them at night. Because of Sigal, there are young girls who have chosen life, who discovered their own strengths and knew they had somewhere to turn, a hug, a shoulder and kind eyes.”\nSigal, Elem added in a statement, “had a joy for life and humor.

She was a wonderful and sensitive person. She knew how to approach people and help them. At her funeral, many youth and her students came, and said that she changed their lives.”\nHer other brother, Yuval, told Kan that Sigal was “always a people person, already from a young age when she was little, she had this thing where she would stand near people talking and listen in on their conversations. She listened to everything.”\nA month after the massacre, her fiance told Kan that “the hardest part now, is the part where you realize how much she is missing in your life. Because that’s life. And she’s not there.”\nAtiya said the wedding plans were largely finished: “We picked a date, we decided on all of the vendors… In the end, I buried her instead of marrying her.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "David “Fritz” Shalev, 75, and his oldest son Tal Shalev, 53, who was visiting his father, were murdered by Hamas terrorists in the family home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7.\nThey were considered missing until November 7, when they were determined to have been killed. A funeral service was held on November 10 in Kibbutz Lahav.\nThey were survived by their wife and mother, Bracha — who was out of the country on October 7 — and four younger children/siblings, Gai, Shai, Gali and Ziv. Tal is also survived by his daughter, Hadar, and David had eight other grandchildren.\nThe kibbutz said David, the son of Holocaust survivors, arrived there in the late 1960s with a group of other youths. He eventually became head of the kibbutz’s field crops and worked in agriculture for many years, as well as earning a master’s degree in electrical engineering and working in that field.\nTal was born on the kibbutz and grew up there. He later left and lived in the center of the country and worked as a materials engineer, before switching fields to work in alternate medicine.\nRakefet Pere memorialized the father and son at their funeral. She was “adopted” by the Shalevs when she was in a pre-military prep school at Nir Oz more than 25 years ago.\nPere recounted many of the memories from the times she spent with the family, “talking into the night with Tal about everything and nothing, walking to the kibbutz pub every Thursday night for a beer with David and Tal, or just with David; the cynical jokes at the Friday night dinner table.”\n“David was a wonderful combination of completely secular and righteous in the way he lived. His ability to live life in the most simple way, to enjoy the little things made him extremely rich. Wine, Sheridan’s liquor, good coffee, swimming in the reservoir, books, and a thirst for knowledge, his love of work and inventions, his enormous love for Bracha and the kids and later his grandkids, love of travel, tai chi… He was cynical and sharp but loved people like no other.”\nTal’s childhood friend, Ido, said at his funeral that he “stood out as a talented and diligent worker” in several different areas of the kibbutz, most prominently working with its horses “which you loved so much.” But what stood out the most, he said, “was your strong connection to your nuclear family… Such a united family wasn’t typical on the kibbutz at that time.”\nShai, David’s son and Tal’s brother, eulogized them at their funeral.\n“Tal was a wonderful older brother,” he said, recalling their time together riding horses, “he had a very unique relationship with the horses, I’d never seen anything like it… He was very sensitive, it was like he knew how to speak to the animals… He had and will always have a special place in my heart, and I love him.”\nShai said his father had many talents “from helping with math homework to fixing a flat bicycle tire or fixing anything at all… He wasn’t the most warm and embracing dad, but over the years Grandma Bracha softened him up and opened him up, and slowly the flower that he was emerged. He turned into a dad and grandfather of hugs, of treats… He was an incredible grandfather to the kids of all the siblings, and a special father to me.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

In the clip, he compares their mission to the 1973 Yom Kippur War, an existential fight for Israel which broke out exactly 50 years before the current conflict.\n“In 10 years, there will be [another] hero commander of the 13th, with hero troops. Some of you will be parents, some of you will be who knows where. He’ll dispatch the force on Yom Kippur. And they will tell about you and see pictures of our dead,” he says in the video, comparing his soldiers to those who fought in the Yom Kippur War in 1973, whom they presumably had heard stories about. “You are no less heroic than them,” he continues. “You’re not spoiled. You don’t seem to be the iPhone generation.”\nLt. Col. Tomer Grinberg embraces his daughter, Arbel, in July 2023. (IDF Spokesperson)\nAt his funeral, his father, Isaac, said “we are all prepared to give our soul and to die for the State of Israel — that is Golani, that is Tomer.”\nGrinberg had fought in Shejaiya in 2014, during Israel’s previous ground invasion of Gaza, when 13 soldiers from his battalion were killed in a battle there. On Oct. 7, he led the battle against Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Nir Oz, one of the border communities that was hit hard in the invasion. Golani lost 40 soldiers that day.\nBaruch Ben Yigal, whose son served under Grinberg and was killed in 2020, told Radio 103FM that hearing of Grinberg’s death made him feel like he “lost another son.”\n“Since Amit died, Tomer made sure to come over and take part in any ceremony in Amit Ben Yigal’s memory. Thank you, dear Tomer. Grinberg family, you are now part of our family,” he told Ynet.\nAshira Grinberg, wife of Lt. Col. Tomer Grinberg, the Commander of the Golani Brigade’s 13th Battalion, is comforted by Defense Minister Yoav Galant during his funeral at the Mount Herzl Military Cemetery in Jerusalem on December 13, 2023. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90)\nTomer’s brother, Ziv, who has also been fighting in Gaza and last saw his brother when the two traveled toward the Gaza border on Oct. 7, said: “We knew that it is a privilege to defend our country and it comforts me to know that you would have felt fulfilled with what you did.”\nHis wife, Ashira Grinberg, said she’d decided to read a letter she’d written for his recent birthday as part of her eulogy.\n“Congratulations my love. [Our daughter] Arbel made you a drawing with a blessing and she is so happy with the idea. I have so much to tell you and share with you but this is not the time. When everything is over, we will have all the time in the world to celebrate life together and our decision to be together,” she read.\n“Tomer, until now and still, a part of you belongs to us — I want to speak for a moment that you will be my Tomer,” she said between sobs. Reading the card, she said, “I believe that you arrived at this moment in order to be in this cursed war, may it end as quickly as possible. Your beard looks good on you and we will celebrate when you return.”\nShe added, “Nothing will separate between us, even if the world stops one day.”\nAshira said she believed her husband had come “into this world for this time period,” noting “your ability to keep your cool, to command others, and to be an inspirational and motivating character, to elicit trust from countless people, your subordinates and also other soldiers in the IDF.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Sgt. Shirel Mor, 19, an observation soldier in the Border Defense Corps’s 414th unit, from Ra’anana, was killed when Hamas terrorists overran the Nahal Oz IDF base.\nShe was buried on October 12 in Ra’anana. She was described by her loved ones as a talented piano player, a lover of animals and wise beyond her years.\nMor is survived by her mother, Edna, father, Yuri, and siblings Ilana, Shalom, Michaela and Matanel.\nHer mother, Edna, expressed great anger toward authorities over the failures that led to the killing of her beloved daughter.\n“It wasn’t only Hamas who killed our children. It was the government, the decision-makers in the army, they were also accomplices,” she said in an interview with the Kan public broadcaster.\n“I gave birth to a daughter, but I didn’t raise her — she was born mature and educated. A huge and pure soul, she came here for 20 years to educate us, me and her father and her older sister and older brother. She contributed so much at home, she was full of joy of life, she had everything,” her mother told Kan.\n“She understood everyone, she never argued with anyone, she always pursued justice. When she would hear others speaking unkindly, she would stop them with a smile,” Edna added. “I had a daughter who was a psychologist from birth, modest and talented. She was beautiful but she never acknowledged that, once saying ‘There’s no reason to be proud of beauty, it passes with time, be proud of achievements.'”\nEdna said her comrades on the IDF base “didn’t know she was a talented and professional piano player, only recently there was a piano in a train station and she started to play and they understood her talent. She was a hero. My mother fled Minsk at the time of the Second World War, and my daughter was murdered here in a holocaust.”\nHer friend, Lior Tzadok, wrote on Instagram that they had met up just two weeks earlier: “I was at your house after a long time that I didn’t visit, we sat and we laughed, we spoke about your release from the army and the trip we would take afterward, and then we sat in your kitchen and ate from the pot of meatballs your mother made for the holiday.”\nHe continued: “My Shireli, you were everything to me, we told each other everything, without judging each other, the conversations we had I’ll never have with anyone else. You were so intelligent and sophisticated, you always knew how to say exactly the right thing, and you always knew how to support me. However beautiful you were on the outside, you were even more beautiful within.”\nRonit Galai Sankevitz, Shirel’s longtime piano teacher, shared a clip of her playing with Army Radio, saying that she started working with her when she was just 8 years old.\n“A gifted musician, bursting with musicality, and a divine touch on the keys,” Galai Sankevitz described her. “She began her piano lessons with me at age 8, and through the creativity of the genius composers, she expressed her own sensitive and compassionate internal world… She persevered with her playing until her enlistment, and even in the few breaks she had at home, she continued to play and to practice — the piano gave her great joy.”\n“And I — I was blessed with a talented student. I will miss her hugs, her playing, her outer beauty which matched her inner beauty,” she continued. “Perhaps if there is another universe, better than ours, more compassionate than ours, Shirel is there continuing to play the piano.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Their family, their children and their grandchildren were their whole world, and the community in which they lived — which they established after they were evacuated from Yamit [a settlement in the Sinai] — where they raised their children, Netiv Ha’asara, was an integral part of them, and their big love.”\nNechama wrote that every Simhat Torah — the day they were murdered — they would throw a big barbeque “and dozens of people would come to their open house… We miss you so much Arieh, who loved people and dogs, an incredible cook and a wonderful grandfather, and you Ruti, a weaver of flowers, whose pot of stuffed cauliflower we would gobble up. Our hearts are broken and we have only memories and photos left.”\nOr worked as a student coordinator for Agrostudies, which brought agricultural interns from around the world to study in Israel. The organization wrote in her memory that “‘Or,’ in Hebrew, means light. And so she was, a ray of light in all of our lives. With her deep, blue eyes and a wide smile that right away spread an optimistic and joyful feeling when she was around.”\n“She loved her students so much, was one of a kind, and one of the greatest and beloved coordinators we had. Her all-time goal was to lift the students up and to make them feel at home. She was so proud of her students and their achievements, she was their mother and family,” the company added. “She was a fighter, a motivated person who always encouraged everyone to chase their goals and dreams.”\nYehonatan Cohen, Or’s fiance, wrote a month after her death about all of their unfulfilled plans and dreams.\n“All of our plans, the wedding we wanted and spoke about so much, the expected promotion at work, our unending laughs and silly arguments, our gourmet meals of cold schnitzel with ketchup and mayonnaise at 3 a.m…. Where is everything?! How has it all been cut off in the middle?! And why?!”\n“You were the purest person in the world, the most real, the happiest, and the most alive… ever since we met 4.5 years ago you lifted me up, built up what was missing, with your wide heart and unending acceptance… The world has gone insane and the sky has fallen. Not fallen, but shattered, shattered and blown up on the ground. I don’t know what we do now.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Ben Shimoni, 31, was killed trying to save a group of people from the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re’im on October 7.\nShimoni attended the doomed event and initially made it to safety, fleeing from the unfolding Hamas massacre in his vehicle with four frantic strangers in the car. He dropped them off in Beersheba some 30 minutes away and, despite their distraught pleas to stay, he quickly headed back to the festival to save more people.\nShimoni made one more such trip, saving another group of five people and yet again heading back to rescue more, according to family, friends, and witness accounts. He was killed on that third rescue attempt after his vehicle came under heavy gunfire from Hamas terrorists who set up a checkpoint on the road.\nThe moment was captured on the car’s dashcam. It showed terrorists opened fire at the vehicle, spraying the windshield with bullets and then the car slows down and crashes into another vehicle on the side of the road.\nThe car was later found riddled with bullets and glass, but empty.\nShimoni was initially considered missing, as his family, his girlfriend, and many friends published post after post on social media desperately pleading for any information on his whereabouts.\nHis passengers in the vehicle on that final trip were also initially missing. Partygoer Gaya Halifa, who was on the phone with her dad when the vehicle came under fire, was found dead days later. Her best friend Romi Gonen, who was shot and injured, was taken hostage by terrorists and has been held in Gaza since October 7.\nA fourth passenger, Ofir Tzarfati, who was also shot and injured was presumed captive but later confirmed dead. On December 1, the military announced it had recovered his body from Gaza\nShimoni saved at least nine lives that day and died trying to save three more.\nHis family and friends say he was exactly the kind of person who would put himself in danger to save others. The story of his heroism that day is legendary among survivors of the Supernova massacre, where at least 360 people were slaughtered, amid brutal atrocities and accounts of rape, sexual abuse, and torture.\nIsraeli band Synergia released a song based on a poem about Shimoni.\n“Who is the person who goes back into hell, a moment after he escaped,” goes the first line of the lyrics.\nA graffiti artist also captured Shimoni’s image on a “wall of heroes” in Tel Aviv to honor those who saved others from the death and destruction on October 7. He appears alongside Awad Darawshe, a paramedic who was killed at Supernova as he treated wounded partygoers, Staff Sgt. Aner Elyakim Shapiro, an unarmed off-duty soldier who tossed back grenades terrorists had thrown inside a packed public bomb shelter near the music festival until he was killed, and Amit Mann, a paramedic and paramedic course instructor who was murdered by terrorists when they stormed the clinic in Kibbutz Be’eri where she was treating the wounded.\nShimoni, said his girlfriend Jessica Elter, was “an angel, and my hero, nobody else I know would risk their lives like that,” she told the Jewish Chronicle after the October 7 shock Hamas attack.\nShimoni’s cousin, Keren Shimoni, told the UK’s Independent publication that the family was heartbroken when they learned of his death but “not shocked that Ben would go do what he feels is right, regardless of the risk to himself, that’s within his character.”\n“There is hardly a person who met Ben — and did not fall in love with him immediately,” Elter said. “It happened to me too. He entered the heart of everyone who knew and met him.”\nShimoni and Elter first met about six years ago in Jerusalem where Shimoni co-owned two businesses — a bar and a late-night eatery — and came to be known in the Israeli music and nightclub scene.\nShe described him as “shy, loyal, very honest with every person he met, and never said no to someone in need. He always put others before himself, truly. He had the best heart ever. And the thing he did that morning testifies to the person he was.”\nThe couple had previously attended the annual Supernova festival together several times.\n“Nova was for everyone, it included everyone; all kinds of people, of all ages, backgrounds and countries, all just coming together to hear good music and for peace,” said Elter, who decided not to go this year and stayed behind in her and Shimoni’s shared apartment in Ashkelon.\nOn October 7, Shimoni called Elter during his rescue trips. “While he was driving, I would hear shooting and rockets exploding, one of which landed very close to the car, but still he was more worried about me. He told me to shut the doors and be careful, and to take care of his mum who was staying with us,” she recounted.\n“Suddenly, I heard Ben asking, confused but not afraid, if some people in the road were Hamas terrorists or Israeli police. I heard the girls in the back screaming and pleading with Ben at the top of their lungs to ‘Drive, drive, drive!’ I heard a lot of yelling in Arabic and a big crash, some shooting and, after a minute of quiet the phone just hung up.”\nElter said it’s now her life’s mission to keep Shimoni’s memory. “This is the only thing I can do for him now,” she said.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Alon Shamriz, 26, was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7 and taken to Gaza. On December 15, Shamriz and two other Israeli hostages were shot dead by IDF forces in Gaza after they were mistaken by troops for Hamas terrorists.\nHis body was brought back to Israel by the military, and he was buried in Kibbutz Shefayim on December 17. He is survived by his parents, Avi and Dikla, and his three siblings Ido, Yonatan and Roni.\nShamriz, a computer engineering student at Sapir College, was remembered as an outgoing people person, with a sharp mind and a love of snooker.\nHis brother, Ido, said at his funeral that for 70 days his family tried desperately to bring him home, “but we didn’t do everything. But you did. You were on your own journey, in the dark without glasses, held by monsters in terrible conditions, without water, without food, without oxygen and without daylight. You survived all this with courage and you waited for redemption. I spoke about you so much in every meeting and every interview, but I didn’t say how brave you are. You always knew what was good for you, and you did things in your way.”\nIdo said Alon was only dreaming of the moment: “We would pass the time with all of the things we loved to do together, to watch Maccabi games, watching Louis C.K.’s standup, a little Will Ferrell and Sacha Baron Cohen, to play poker. We made sure you would have a high-quality snooker table. I was waiting so much to play with you again, just to tell you that you were the best. A brilliant player with the whole package. The psychologists told me to do things that I love, but what I loved was doing them with you, and now there’s no point to anything.”\nWe had “so much fun together, we laughed and we made others laugh, even bad experiences we turned into entertainment. Our whole life was like a comedy film, so how is it logical that the end was so tragic?”\nHis sister, Roni, also spoke at his funeral, saying, “Just a few days ago I stood in front of many people and told them how hard it was without you. We were so sure that the hole in our heart would be refilled.”\n“It was supposed to end differently,” she continued. “You’re supposed to be alive. Alon, I am sorry. All this time I can only think, ‘What if?’ But it doesn’t matter anymore… I won’t forget you and what a hero you are.”\nHis father, Avi, told the Kan public radio that he is convinced his son was the one who figured out how to escape from their Hamas captors and led them through the tunnels, drawing from his time in the military: “My son was a hero.”\n“Alon was a brilliant child, a 26-year-old guy, an athlete, a social guy, a man with a good heart,” Avi told Kan. “He started to learn computer engineering, he worked with us in the factory, he was a talent, he was responsible for the logistics. His friends loved him, it’s hard for me to come and speak about him in the past tense, but he was a magical kid, any family would be in love with a kid like this.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Settha “Tom” Homsorn, 36, a Thai agricultural worker from the Nakhon Phanom province in northeastern Thailand, was murdered by Hamas terrorists on October 7 in Kibbutz Kfar Aza.\nHe is survived by his father, Phaeng Homsorn, an older sister, Netnapha, and two younger brothers, Jessada and Anuwat, as well as an 8-year-old daughter; his mother died in August. His body was returned to Thailand for cremation on November 9.\nHis friend, fellow Thai laborer Wayo Yama, described the moment of the attack in a harrowing interview published by the Kan public broadcaster.\nWhen they heard the missiles start, Yama said, they ran for their shelter. Shortly afterward, he said, “four men showed up, they came straight up to our house, they were in plain clothes, but they had guns, grenades and knives,” recounted Yama.\n“Tom had no idea why people were running, that’s why he opened his door. And they were right outside his room. He was captured right there. He said ‘I’m from Thailand, I’m from Thailand,’ but they didn’t listen. They took Tom,” he said.\nThey also took Yama and tied up his arms and covered his head. They brought a group of them to the home of someone else in the kibbutz. When the terrorists guarding Yama looked away, he grabbed an opportunity and “jumped out the window.”\nYama escaped, but Homsorn was killed alongside their other friend, Nitikorn “Lee” Seawang, while others were taken captive.\n“I am sorry that I couldn’t save them,” he said. “I saw it all but I couldn’t do anything. I am so sorry about this. And I want to tell them that I miss and love them very much.”\nHomsorn’s Facebook page shows that he worked in Israel since at least January 2020. He posted photos of himself visiting the Dead Sea, working on a tractor, harvesting produce and posing with IDF soldiers. In May 2021, during Operation Guardian of the Walls, Homsorn shared photos of Iron Dome interceptions as well as a fire in a field caused by a fallen rocket or shrapnel.\nOn September 27, two days after Yom Kippur and a little over a week before he was killed, he posted an image of himself wearing a small knitted kippa.\nHis brother, Jessada Homsorn, who also worked in Israel and returned home after the war started, was quoted by a local Thai news outlet saying he is “very sad having lost someone in the family. But if the war ends, I want to go back to work there again, because I believe that it will be the only way to be able to build a better future.”\nHis friend Piak Saiyopo wrote on Facebook: “One of the Thai workers who died is a brother I know… we used to watch movies together, used to eat together. I would always go to see you and be welcomed… may you become a star in heaven.”\nHomsorn’s sister, Netnapha, wrote on Facebook: “I miss you so much… every baht, every satang, you sent it home, to dad, to mom, to your child, to take care of them… it’s a pity for the sweat, it’s a pity for the dream that you would get out of the tractor, come back and buy a garden to live with your child. Every time I think about it, my heart breaks.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Maayan Idan, 18, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in her home in Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7.\nHer father, Tsachi Idan, was kidnapped and taken hostage in Gaza.\nThe rest of the family said Tsachi was holding the safe room door shut as terrorists shot through it, killing Maayan. When he realized his daughter had been shot, Tsachi let go of the door in shock, and the terrorists stormed in. They eventually took him, leaving his wife, Gali, and their younger children behind, as they livestreamed the entire encounter on Facebook.\nMaayan was not buried until October 22. In addition to her parents, she is survived by her younger siblings Sharon, 15, Yael, 11 and Shahar, 9, and a number of extended relatives.\nThe high schooler was remembered as a talented volleyball player, who loved to read and was devoted to her younger siblings as well as to her parents. At her funeral, they played her favorite song, “Father and Son” by Cat Stevens, as her family sang along to the lyrics: “Just relax, take it easy/ You’re still young, that’s your fault/ There’s so much you have to know.”\nAt her funeral, her mother Gali said she is now “shattered into pieces… now you will stay 18 forever, 18 and 4 days. Beautiful, in the brown dress you wore for your birthday, with your abundant curls. I don’t know how they can murder a unique and rare unicorn like you, Maayani.”\n“How can they murder someone who is fully good and pure with the smile of an angel and a deep soul?”\nLior Lahav, Maayan’s uncle, told Kan news at her funeral that his niece had “something angelic about her, something outside of the norm, a type of quiet, a type of maturity.”\nHer grandmother, Dvora Idan, wrote on Facebook that Maayan was “just 18, you rushed to enlist — to the army of the heavens… how can I say farewell, you made me into an overjoyed grandmother, you captivated me with your inner quiet, your modesty, your simplicity together with your enormous determination.”\nDvora recalled attending every one of her granddaughter’s volleyball games and cheering from the stands: “Your eyes were always on the ball, in impossible situations on the field that you turned into possible, you gave your soul in every game and also the victory.” Maayan, she wrote, always asked for books as presents, and was so excited to finally get her driver’s license.\n“You insisted on being the driver to take your grandma to your birthday celebration,” she recalled, picking her up just days before Maayan was murdered. “You were a wonderful driver, and now you must keep driving into a better world… I am parting from your body in pain and grief, but your soul, Maayani, is in my heart, I am connected deeply and strongly to your soul forever.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

His mother said that he told them to get under the bed and stay quiet as the terrorists broke into their home.\nIn addition to his children, Yoni is survived by his parents, Omer and Noelle, siblings Adam, Natasha and Dan, and ex-wife Ola. His brother Kenny died in 2015.\nRapoport was born on the Isle of Wight, and moved to Israel when he was young.\nHis mother, Noelle, described him to the BBC as “a lovely man” with “a wonderful sense of humor and the most amazing smile that just lit up the room.” She said he was “very much loved” by members of the kibbutz, and “he never went by without smiling at them, saying hello and helping them.”\nYoni was described as a devoted fan of Manchester United, and was planning to take Yosef to his first game in November with his brother Adam.\n“He was so excited to be taking Yosefi with him so it’s very heartbreaking now. Yoni will always be with us. He’s in my heart and always will be and I just miss him,” Noelle said.\nThe team paid tribute to him in their newsletter after his death.\nYoni worked on the kibbutz as a gardener. An obituary published on the kibbutz website said that he had taken a number of courses in horticulture and was about to start another.\n“In his work he was the right hand of the elderly, he helped them cultivate their gardens, helped to plant or prune, and in his shy way asked how everyone was doing and always offered help,” the obituary reads. “He worked diligently and quietly, driving the kibbutz trails in his Gator, loaded with prunings or carrying plants from the nursery. When you got into a random conversation with him about trees, only then did you realize the great knowledge he had accumulated over the years and his great passion for the subject. They loved him on the kibbutz.”\nAdam Rapoport, Yoni’s brother, described him to the BBC as a “great father” who was a gardener at the kibbutz, and who loved “the trees and the nature.”\nAdam wrote on Facebook that “the beautiful kibbutz with its hundreds of flowering trees and shrubs which you and your team worked so hard to nurture and maintain turned in an instant into a death trap.”\n“Aluma said that the last thing you said to her and Yosef was to get under the bed. As always, even in the hardest moments, your children were your top priority, and you saved their lives,” he added.\n“We will miss you. We will miss the things that annoyed us a little, like your empty coffee cups you would leave outside, we will miss meals with you and the kids at mom and dad’s house, we will miss watching games together, the sweet scent of smoke that accompanied you, we will miss your sharp and cynical sense of humor, our trips to Manchester, stories about your time in India, your enormous knowledge of trees.

He told BBC that as the air raid sirens sounded on October 7 and he ran for shelter, he texted both Mtenga and Mollel. “They told me that there were so many rockets coming from Gaza — and that they were going to the shelters too,” he said. But a few hours later, they were no longer answering.\nJoshua — the oldest of five children — had finished a diploma in agriculture studies from a college in the eastern Tanzanian city of Morogoro and then left for Israel in September — his first time traveling out of Tanzania.\nHe was working in the Kibbutz Nahal Oz dairy farm, and was excited to learn more about farming, wanted to eventually open his own agricultural business back home.\nA few weeks after the attack, his father spoke to BBC, telling them he last spoke to Joshua on October 5, two days before the Hamas onslaught.\n“I said, ‘Be on your best behavior because you’re somewhere new, and make the most of the internship you’re there to do,'” he recounted.\n“My son wants to make his fortune in agribusiness and become one of Tanzania’s most successful farmers,” his father said at the time, saying they were hoping he would return home from his studies to build a successful business.\n“We can’t eat or sleep — when I go to the market people ask me why I’m losing so much weight,” said his father weeks after the attack.\nHe told AFP in late October, “I feel bad all the time because my son is not a warrior.

At 14 he arrived on the kibbutz with a youth movement and stayed there for most of the rest of his life. He fought as a reservist in both the Yom Kippur War and the First Lebanon War.\nHe was remembered fondly for wearing bright colors, driving around the kibbutz on his electric scooter which was covered in stickers, and handing out figs and sabras he grew himself.\n“He was very active, he was present at every event, he was a very colorful character: He was color-blind and would dress in all sorts of unique colors,” his daughter, Shani Miles Itach told the Kan public broadcaster.\n“He was the champion of sabra fruit and figs, he was known for that.

Ariel is also survived by his wife, Hadar.\nThe pair were buried side by side in the military section of the Ofakim cemetery on October 13 — after their sister fought and won the right to provide them both with a military funeral.\nAriel, an electrical engineering student, and Roi, a Golani soldier, went out to the streets to fight against Hamas terrorists in Ofakim.\nAriel’s wife, Hadar, told the Makor Rishon newspaper that they were staying with his parents over the Simhat Torah holiday and awoke from the air raid sirens, then heard gunfire outside.\n“Ariel ran out the door with his weapon drawn, running toward the gunfire, Roi ran after him with bare hands, and I ran after them shouting ‘Ariel, Ariel!’ He was so focused that he didn’t look back, he just shouted to Roi ‘Go back, go home!'”\nHadar said that she was around 50m (150 ft) away when she saw Ariel take up a position behind a wall: “He had his gun ready, shooting toward the terrorists… Then I saw five terrorists come from behind the wall, shoot him from a very short distance, and he fell. After a few minutes Roi was also killed.”\nShe said she ran from the scene and hid in a building, and only realized she had been shot after a neighbor pointed out her leg was bleeding. She wanted to go check to see if Ariel was still breathing, but she said she understood he was no longer alive. “Ariel and Roi went out to fight and protect the city. They were brave and wanted to save lives. Ariel drew the gunfire to him, and therefore people who were outside managed to flee. He and Roi were very close, and were not parted even in death.”\nTheir sister, Hodaya Guri, 28, told Ynet that “they went to fight first… Ariel’s wife begged him to stop, to come home. But he didn’t listen.” Hodaya said, “The Ofakim that we knew until now was a happy city, people didn’t lock their doors, it was safe. It says at the entrance to the city, ‘a city of people.’ It should be changed to read ‘a city of heroes.'”\nRoi’s friend, Eliad Sharabi, wrote on TikTok that he met him when he came to help run a summer camp in Ashkelon. “The moment he walked in and smiled I saw his Jewish soul smiling, his pure eyes and we immediately connected.” Sharabi said he spent Shabbat with the Guri family “and Roi came to pick me up and hugged me, took care of me, made me food and gave me his bed… I am so proud that I was your friend, that I was privileged to know you.”\nHodaya told Ynet that they grew up in a “home full of the joy of life… During our entire childhood, we would play outside, in the neighborhood, playing tag and hide and seek until we were called in for dinner.”\nBoth of her brothers “had a lot of love for the land and especially for Ofakim,” said Hodaya. “And they were both generous people… I wouldn’t expect them to act any differently. It was fun to be with them, they each had something special.”\nAriel, she said “was like my twin brother, we went to the same elementary school, I knew his friends and he knew my friends, we would hang out a lot together… He was the jokester of the house, he had a rare talent of always managing to pull out a joke even in unpleasant circumstances.”\nRoi, Hodaya recounted, was someone “I looked at with admiration, we had a special relationship… he was the first one I told when I started dating [now husband] Matanel. He always understood me, he was a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on.”\n“I still haven’t come to terms with the fact that in one day I lost two brothers.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She said the terror attack that took her husband was barely mentioned amid the horrors of October 7, and Israel’s complicated relationship with Cairo.\n“Everything has been silenced, I need there to be justice for my Alon,” she said. She recounted running to find him after the shooting stopped, “and I saw him lying on the ground. Around us everyone was looking, filming us, but nobody helped us.”\nAsaf Gerenstein, director of the Hapoel Tel Aviv youth department, described Shamli as “a wonderful guy. Modest, smiling, positive, moral, very professional and thorough. He invested so much in his players and the department.”\nGerenstein added that “his players and his students that he coached and taught were very connected to him, professionally but mostly emotionally,” and it was very hard to inform them that he had been killed.\nMor described her husband as “a guy who captures hearts in a moment. Everyone falls in love with him immediately. I was privileged to have received his love. Every word I say is dwarfed by his captivating personality. His internal beauty shined outward.”\n“He was a magical guy,” she added. “He always took care of me, was always there for me before anyone.

But a few days later her body was also located, and she was laid to rest on October 15.\nThey are survived by their parents, Manny and Sigal, and younger brother Shai. Norelle’s boyfriend, Amit Cohen, was also with them at the rave and murdered alongside them.\nNorelle and Roya were both born in Los Angeles, according to family, and attended the Temple Israel of Hollywood Jewish day school before they moved to Israel.\n“They’re just the most lovable people, they come in a room and they just make everybody happy,” their friend, Noa, who was with them at the party, told NBC News.\nWhile sitting shiva for Roya, and waiting to hear about Norelle, their parents took part in a Zoom meeting with US President Joe Biden. During the video call, they received a knock on the door informing them that Norelle had also been killed.\nRachel Goldberg, whose son Hersh Goldberg-Polin was taken hostage, told The Times of Israel podcast that Sigal unmuted “and she said, ‘I just got the knock on the door that my other daughter is dead.’ And she started screaming and we all, 12 of us, started crying on the call. And [Biden] put his hands in his hands and started sobbing. And it was so powerful because we were so with her.”\n“As a mom, to live without them, I don’t know how it can happen,” Sigal told Kan News in an interview. “How can I live without them?”\nTheir parents said that authorities told them not to view their bodies for identification, “as it’s better to remember them beautiful.”\n“It’s a sadness that does not end,” said their father Menashe. “I wake up in the morning and ask myself, ‘Today I won’t see them either?'”\nSigal said Norelle and Amit met in South America “and were the most cliche, sparks, love at first sight — he planned to propose to her in February, he was quietly saving up for a ring, but she found out. The joke was always that we need three things for her wedding: a good DJ, good alcohol and Magen David Adom [paramedics] outside.”\n“We won’t accompany them to the huppa, we won’t be grandparents to their children,” she said.\nAt a memorial ceremony, Sigal described Norelle as “beautiful, laughing and loving,” and Roya as “gorgeous and gentle and a dream of light and hope.”\nNorelle’s friend, Yarden Shirazi, wrote on Facebook that she was “the most beautiful girl in the world, who had life’s magic flowing through her, and lit up every place and every person she met on the way. Full of love and generosity, joy of life, endless optimism, my Nori was an angel that walked on earth.”\nThe owners of the Republic restaurant in Hod Hasharon where Roya worked as a waitress, described her to Ynet as full of “humility and self-confidence with a gentle smile that was full of life… she quickly integrated with the staff and became everybody’s friend. She always delved into everything and was eager to learn.”\nThe sisters’ aunt, Leeor Shtainer, wrote on Facebook that Roya, Norelle and Amit were “three rare flowers who grew and blossomed with the endless love and devotion of their parents and their family and friends around them.

Alemnew Emanuel Feleke, 22, of the Commando Brigade’s Duvdevan unit, from Kiryat Gat, was wounded December 5 during fighting in southern Gaza and succumbed to his wounds the following day.\nHe was buried on December 7 in the military cemetery in Kiryat Gat. He is survived by his parents, Andayehu and Mammay, and siblings Noam, Yoav, Sara and Leah.\nFeleke’s family made aliya to Israel from Ethiopia in 2004 and lived for a year in an absorption center in Beersheba. From there, they moved to Bat Yam, where Feleke graduated from a yeshiva high school. The family moved to Kiryat Gat four years ago.\nWhile volunteering with the fire and rescue service and guiding in the Bnei Akiva youth movement, Feleke participated in a program that combined Torah study with preparation for army service. He followed that up with additional Torah study in Safed.\nAccording to his brother Noam, Feleke wanted to be drafted into the Commando Brigade but did not initially make it. He was accepted by the paratroopers, and when he tried out again for the Commando Brigade, he made it into the elite Duvdevan unit.\n“He had recently finished the training course for that and received a company excellence award. He was supposed to go to officers’ training, but because of the war that got delayed and he stayed where he was to fight,” his brother said.\nNoam said his brother “was always modest and very much liked to help. He gave of himself all the time, over and over.”\nThat was the main reason the family decided to donate his organs after his death, Noam said, as a way of continuing his spirit of giving.\nHis heart and lungs went to an unidentified patient, while his liver was donated to a 53-year-old woman, one of his kidneys and his pancreas were transplanted into a 45-year-old woman and his other kidney went to a 58-year-old man.\nAt his funeral, the deputy commander of Duvdevan, identified only as Maj. S, said “Emanuel was a symbol and a legend in his life. You were number one everywhere. Determined, goal-oriented, doing everything for the best. Imbued with a sense of mission and spirit and unafraid of challenges… and all this with enormous humility and modesty. You never felt a need to draw attention to yourself.”\nSpeaking at his brother’s funeral, Noam said Emanuel was always determined to serve in combat in the army, to defend and protect his beloved nation.\n“You always said you would die protecting this homeland,” he said. “The resilience of this country, that our parents dreamed of, told stories that passed from person to person, a whole community which dreamed and achieved its dream. Nobody knows when he will return his soul to the creator. But you knew.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Her father is Jewish and her mother is not, and the rabbinate refused to allow her to be buried in a Jewish cemetery, even though her family said she was mid-conversion — sparking an outcry. Following the outrage, local religious authorities said they would lower the fence between the sections and cover it with vegetation.\nPlahti is survived by her parents, Olga and Roman and brother Ilya; Eliyahu is survived by his parents, Ori and Liat and sister Avia.\nPlahti’s mother, Olga, said Alina used to “light [Shabbat] candles and separate challah… I want to tell you that she was murdered because she was Jewish.”\nOlga said she spoke to her daughter after the rockets started firing, and she told her she was running to escape from the terrorists. She called her again 15 minutes later, “and she said ‘Mommy, I can’t talk right now, I’ll call you later, I love you.'” That was the last she heard from her. “We waited three weeks, we searched for her. Alina was very strong, until the last moment we didn’t believe we would get such news.”\nFriends and family of Eliyahu said he loved photography and brought his new camera to Supernova to document the event. He loved nature and music festivals, and enjoyed working out and keeping a healthy lifestyle, they recalled. His mother said he had a “joyful energy and a pure heart.”\nPlahti’s friend, Tohar Hen, described her on Instagram as “my pure and beautiful angel… everyone could sense your presence, your nobility, your optimism, your energy, just by sitting next to you.”\nHagit Asulin, a friend of the couple, wrote on social media that they met at a party like the Supernova, and since then were inseparable: “He said that Alina would be his wife, he had found the love of his life.”\nAsulin wrote that Plahti “overcame depression and anxiety, and she dreamed of becoming a mentor.

He even posted photos on Facebook of the enormous damage inside his home from the volley of gunfire.\nHis family never heard from him again and waited desperately for any news of him before his body was located and he was buried on October 20 in Shefayim, where members of the kibbutz were relocated.\nHermesh, a devoted dog owner, was remembered as a deeply dedicated fan of the Hapoel Tel Aviv sports club, and very active among the fan base, as well as being notably outspoken and never holding back on his thoughts. His funeral was attended by a sea of people in red shirts who memorialized him by donning the colors of the team he loved.\nFollowing the Hamas onslaught, Israel Hayom republished an interview with Hermesh conducted five years ago, in which he expressed his love for the kibbutz where he made his life: “My life is here. When I finish a day of work, I take a bottle of beer, listen to one of my records and enjoy every moment… I don’t want to live in Israel in any place other than Kfar Aza.”\nAt his funeral, his mother, Hava, said: “You promised me more than once that as long as I was alive, you wouldn’t die.

The ground shook as hundreds if not thousands of people turned over every stone to find you, unable to accept that your story was over.”\nHis friend and fellow fan Liron Teeni said at his funeral: “Omer, there were games of Hapoel that had fewer fans than are here right now [at your funeral].

In 1973, Tami’s brother, Cpl. Nimrod Greenberg, was killed fighting in the Yom Kippur War — on the eve of Simhat Torah. On October 7, 2004, the day of Simhat Torah, Tami’s daughter, Einat Naor, was murdered in a terror bombing of Israeli vacationers in the Sinai.\nEitan (born Eitan Zeldin) is survived by his daughters, Nili and Na’ama, and Tami is survived by her sons, Assif and Oz, and each had a number of grandchildren.\nEitan Ziv (Courtesy)\nEitan’s daughter, Nili Zlotovsky, said that the IDF believes the couple were among the first killed in the kibbutz: “It appears that they surprised them, they got to them first, broke through the window, shot into the room. My father left the safe room, he was there with his weapon, he truly fought, fired at least a magazine. My father was killed with his weapon in his hand.”\nEitan was a well-known tour guide in the Sha’ar Hanegev region, and a former officer in the elite Sayeret Matkal unit. Friends and family said he was deeply knowledgeable in the history of the region, was dedicated to telling the stories of Israel’s fallen and a true believer in sustainability and preserving the land.\nIn an interview with 103FM radio, Nili revealed that her father served in Sayeret Matkal alongside Benjamin Netanyahu, and was even among those who helped pull him out of the water during an operation in the Suez Canal, although she said she had not heard from the prime minister since her father’s death.\nTami, a native of the nearby Kibbutz Zikim and the child of Holocaust survivors moved to Kfar Aza decades ago and worked for many years in the local grocery shop. Her family said she enjoyed baking and loved animals and was deeply impacted by the loss of both her brother and daughter, but chose to keep living life to the fullest to honor them.\nTami’s son, Oz Laor, told Maariv that he and his mother and brother all met up on Friday, October 6, to visit his sister’s grave.\nTami Peleg Ziv (Courtesy)\n“We spoke, we joked around, we sat in a cafe in Kibbutz Zikim, we watched the ocean, ate breakfast and were together for an hour and a half,” Oz said. “There was a sense of completion of many things, I know from her friends that she told them she left that conversation very encouraged. That was a small comfort. That was the last time we saw her or spoke to her.”\nOz described her as “a very hugging mom, very maternal and caring, even in the period when we lived in the kibbutz children’s house. When I was in high school, I had a complicated surgery and she never left my side for a moment. Even in later years, when I would visit her with the kids, she always made sure we were treated like kings.”\nHe said Tami and Eitan loved to “travel the world, they were in Portugal and Morocco not long ago. She was in many classes and workshops, she took advantage of every moment in life, like a true retiree.”\nEitan’s daughter, Nili Zlotovsky, described him as “the dad every girl dreams of having… We are comforted that you and Tami were killed together because otherwise, neither of you would have wanted to go on living without the other. We are comforted that you protected her until the end. In what universe are those the kinds of things bereaved ones are comforted by?”\nNili said that “aside from being a father you were so many other things: a Sayeret Matkal fighter, an officer with an impressive resume in Israel’s wars, a tour guide with an inexhaustible knowledge in endless fields, truly a walking encyclopedia… A love of the country and the homeland flowed in your veins, for every corner of our little nation you had a true story of a legend. You loved the land, its history, its heritage.”\nHer father, Nili said, “was born a leader, you led soldiers, students, travelers and many friends. You created meaning for so many people and therefore the loss is deep.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was persistent and dedicated when it came to his goals.”\nBefore enlisting he studied at Tel Aviv University, receiving a master’s degree in disaster management. The department described him as “a passionate student.” His final paper focused on the deaf community during the COVID-19 pandemic and its difficulties in communicating when masks were widely used. “He was a good friend of his classmates. His lively personality was a beacon of light in the classroom and will surely be missed,” said the department.\nHis mother, Grace Dean, wrote on Facebook: “Rest in Peace Jonathan. You could not have been loved more.” She and many others who knew him attributed to him the following quote: “Never stop loving. We do not fight because we hate, but because we have such a love in our heart for life.”\nDean described her son as “an adventurous, brave, compassionate and caring young man. I find solace that he is now in the company of his beloved grandparents and Uncle Rich. Jonathan loved orange tulips and I ask you to plant some orange tulips to honor his young and beautiful life.”\nHis cousin, Joelle Marie Muscolino, described him as “sweet, amazing, loving, smart, caring, talented, passionate, uniquely fabulous.”\nShe said that he had “lived in Israel for a bunch of years now and had made it his home, a home where he was loved and celebrated for everything that he was, without judgement, to live freely and happily as Yonatan Chaim, just as his loving heart, soul, and body so deserved to. He was truly happy, and for that I’m so grateful I had the opportunity to witness.”\nShe said that he “felt compelled to protect Israel, the land who had given him so much, from the brutality of the terrorist, evil, savage attacks by Hamas and Islamic Jihadists. He died bravely fighting to defend Israel’s Democracy, the Jewish People that call her home just like he did, and for Judaism around the entire world.”\nChaim received support from the Ach Gadol (Big Brother) organization for lone soldiers, which helps them navigate the IDF. He was assisted there by Adah Forer, who said they bonded since they were both from the US and both enlisted at age 23.\n“From our first meeting I got to know the kind of guy who eats a whole chicken at 5 a.m., and since then I helped him with everything to do with the army, it was a privilege to accompany him and I wish I could keep doing it,” said Forer.\n“Yonatan was a guy with a huge heart, always wanted to help everyone around him and put everyone ahead of himself… He was a light for everyone, it was part of who he was, even the fact that he chose Judaism — he wanted to be part of something bigger than himself,” said Forer.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was buried on December 4 on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.\nFriends and family described Zussman as a talented ping pong player, devoted Beitar Jerusalem sports fan and committed wholly to fighting for the State of Israel.\n“How can I go on without you, my Ben?” asked his sister, Mika at his funeral. “You were the big brother any little sister would ask for. Even when I was little, mom would say that you would take care of me like I was a princess.”\nHis mother, Sarit, said Ben “was a dream child.

I will sit next to grandpa and fill in a few blanks, each one of us will share our experiences and what changed from war to war.\n“If God forbid you are sitting shiva, turn it into a week of friends, family and fun. There should be food, meat of course, beer, sweet drinks, sunflower seeds, tea and of course mom’s cookies. Laugh, tell stories, meet with the rest of my friends you haven’t seen yet. I’m jealous. I would want to sit there and see everyone.”\nZussman wrote that if he were captured, dead or alive, he did not want his family to launch a campaign for his return, nor lobby for the release of imprisoned terrorists, or risk harming any soldier for his rescue.\n“I will say it once more, I left the house before I was even called to reserves.

They headed for their car when the rockets started, then sought refuge in a roadside bomb shelter, last speaking to their family at 7:39 a.m. Several days later, the IDF informed the family that Eynav’s body had been found in the shelter and that Or had been taken captive.\nFamily said that the couple shared everything, including their love of music festivals. They kept a tent in their car for spontaneous road trips, and they recently took a family vacation to Thailand. Above all, friends said, Eynav loved to dance — exactly what she was doing moments before the party turned into a nightmare.\nThe couple met 14 years ago in high school and started as friends before their relationship deepened. They wed five years ago, settled in Givatayim, and Almog was born in 2021.\nEynav worked as a UX/UI designer at the Kaltura software company. The company said she had a “beautiful smile and enormous heart,” and “left behind a beautiful legacy of love and light in her short time with us.”\n“Eynav was wonderful,” her mother-in-law, Geula Levy, told Haaretz. “A sweet girl, I never had even the slightest disagreement with her.

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant granted a special request by Doron to allow Michal and Guy to be buried together in the cemetery’s military section.\nDoron and Lee were overseas at the time of the Hamas assault, visiting Ran, who lives in California. Gali had been home for the weekend she had left to go visit her boyfriend, leaving only Michal and Guy at home.\nDoron told Ynet that “Guy and Michal were found together in the safe room embracing. I knew that’s how they would find them. If they died together then it would be hugging. She didn’t leave him in life and he didn’t leave her either, also in death.”\nHe told 103FM that Michal repeatedly wanted to leave Kfar Aza because of the constant threat of rockets, but he and Guy said they would never leave.\nMichal, an author, underwent an unsuccessful back operation 15 years ago, and was disabled. Doron told Ynet that despite her difficulties “she had a great sense of humor, she was a warrior mother to Guy and to our daughter Gali, who is a soldier in the Navy. Michal saved Gali’s life — she gave her her car so she could go visit her boyfriend and that’s why she wasn’t home.”\nNoa, Guy’s girlfriend, said at the funeral that “the army and the country were always the most important to him in the world. He was different and thought differently than most, he was a man who loved the country and wanted to fight for it. I am certain that he would be content with the fact that he died protecting his home and his mother.”\nGali wrote on Instagram that her mother’s life “was not simple, but I took so many things from you, absorbed so much strength from you, thank you for giving me your strength, God must have known what I would need to deal with… Mom you taught us to dream, to dream and also to achieve, that’s the meaning of living. I will keep dreaming for you, and will try to make your dreams come true.”\nShe wrote that she had always wanted to be a young mother so that her children could get to know her grandparents, “but you they will only get to know through photos and stories… it hurts that they won’t get to know your silliness and your humor, that they will never know that a warm and comforting hug you have… I can only hope that I will be a mother even close to what you were for me.”\nWriting about her brother Guy, Gali said that you “always worried about me, always checked if I was OK, always protected me as a big brother should. You were just so good, the best son to my parents, the best brother to my siblings, the best uncle to my nieces that you loved so much, the best boyfriend to Noa, the best friend in the world and just a good person. I was so privileged to have a brother like that.”\nShe added: “Guy, I will miss you, my heart will burn forever, the hole that you have left behind is so big that I will never be able to describe it in words. I still don’t know how we will keep going without you and without Mom. But I know that we will do everything in our power to immortalize you and remember you the way you would have wanted.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She was buried in Moshav Ahiezer on October 11.\nWhen her parents reached out early Saturday, she told them everything was OK and she was sheltering from the rockets. That was the last they heard from her.\n“She was a girl who didn’t want to worry us,” her father, Yigal, told the Kan public broadcaster.\nYigal said, “Hadar was our joy… our only daughter, a wonderful girl, smiley, beautiful, bashful, but full of ambition. Everything she touched had to be perfect. She wanted to take the world by storm, she had a lot of dreams.”\nHer father said Hadar was a dedicated scout leader, “with endless generosity. All of her proteges came [to the shiva] and we heard how much they were hurting. She touched so many of them, especially the weaker ones in the group.”\nOn her gravestone, her family etched a phrase from the traditional Eshet Chayil (woman of valor) song from Proverbs 31: “Oz v’hadar l’vushah, vatischak l’yom acharon” — “She is dressed in strength and splendor, and she will laugh until the end of time.”\n“‘Oz’ because of Nahal Oz, and Hadar because those were her characteristics, she laughed all of her life, until the day of her death,” said Yigal.\nHer friend, Lia Ben David, wrote on Facebook that she met Cohen at the start of middle school, “and when I saw you, you smiled your smile, a wide smile, a smile of a guardian angel. I connected to you, to your soul, and your contagious laughter from the very first moment. And since then you were my best friend in the world, the best friend who always knew what to say.”\nIn a special Kan project, her mother, Ilanit, dedicated the Yasmin Muallem song “Yihye Tov” (“It will be okay”) in her daughter’s memory.\n“Hadar was the youngest and the princess of the house after three boys,” said Ilanit. “She brought a lot of light, happiness and love to the house, and that’s what she always exuded, and that’s what she wanted that it ‘will be okay.'”\nIlanit added that “even in her last moments, when she messaged us on WhatsApp, that’s what she told everyone, that it was going to be okay, these were her final wishes. And we are all strengthened by what she left us, and the love she left us and wrapped us in. It hurts, but it will be okay.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

The couple attended the rave with Rahoum’s uncle, Avi Sasi, who was also murdered, and two cousins who survived, while another cousin was DJing and managed to hide.\nLevy and Rahoum sought refuge in a roadside bomb shelter — separate from her uncle and cousins — which Hamas terrorists besieged and threw grenades inside. Levy sought to flee and was slain in a volley of gunfire, while Rahoum is believed to have been murdered by a grenade along with many others.\nLevy’s body was discovered after several days, and he was buried on October 11 in Pardesiya. Rahoum’s family was later informed that she too had been killed, and she was buried next to Levy on October 12.\nRahoum was survived by her parents, Ronit and Levi, and siblings Ofri, Omri and Gil. Levy was survived by his parents, Gita and David. A family member said that Levy and Rahoum shared the joyous news about their pregnancy with Levy’s extended family at a holiday meal on Friday evening, hours before they were murdered.\nRonen Levy, Lidor’s uncle, said the news of his death was devastating to his parents, who lost their only child.\n“Lidori, my life, today we buried you and my heart refuses to believe it,” Ronen wrote on Facebook. “I loved you so much, I always will. You have left a dark hole in my soul that will never be filled. You were at your peak; you always took care of those around you, made sure they were enjoying and happy and living their lives to the fullest, you took care of your mother like she was your child, you kept her strong… my brother’s only child, you were their entire world.”\nDanielle Sasi, Rahoum’s cousin, who survived the massacre at the rave with her husband, as she watched her father be killed, wrote that Nitzan was like a sister to her.\n“My Nitz, my friend, my sister, my cousin, how do we go on without you?!” Sasi wrote on Instagram. “Visiting Israel will never be the same without you. Who will I call when I land and who will I speak with when I’m sad… who will rack up experiences with me and new moments. How much fun and joy we had that night, we danced, we hugged, we laughed and we loved. I’m sorry I couldn’t save you, I’m sorry you had to go through all that… I’m sorry we won’t be able to raise our children together as we planned.”\nLevy’s cousin, Nofar Beliak, described seeing the couple for the last time right before they headed for the festival-turned-nightmare.\n“Last Friday we celebrated with the whole family in Ashkelon, you played billiards with my dad, Nitzan talked to everyone and you shared with all of us about your exciting pregnancy, and tried to calculate when the brit mila would be… I can’t believe that now we are burying you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Ofra was taken captive while out for her traditional early morning walk.\nOfra Keidar, right, and her daughter Yael Keidar. Ofra was taken captive by Hamas terrorists from Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7, 2023 and died in captivity. Her death was confirmed by the IDF on December 2, 2023. (Courtesy)\nAt her father’s funeral, Yael said “your loss is already felt and I am going to miss you so much.” Friends said Sami worked for decades in agriculture on the kibbutz, and was also known for building wooden toys, playing Beatles songs on his guitar, and as a modest, unassuming man devoted to his children. He built a stable himself in the kibbutz to provide equine therapy for Yael, and was always building things until he got sick.\nShiraz Keidar, the couple’s daughter-in-law, who also lived in Be’eri, said that Sami had Parkinson’s disease and did not make it to the safe room, and was murdered while sitting on his sofa. His Filipino caregiver, Joey Pagsolingan, was wounded by gunfire and is recovering.\nPagsolingan told Channel 12 news that as the terrorists stormed into the home, Sami “told me, ‘don’t worry, Joey, no one will come here’… I miss that guy.”\nTheir granddaughter, Argaman Keidar, wrote on Facebook in late November that she had returned to what was left of their homes in Be’eri: “Once we sat there together and celebrated his birthday, and he smiled and I hugged him,” she wrote of her grandfather Sami. “And the next time we came to gather final memories from him, so he will be with us forever, and his belongings will be saved and protected.”\nOfra, who lived in Be’eri for almost all of the past 60 years, was remembered by friends and family as a lover of exercise, who always took her daily morning walk, loved gardening, swimming and animals — and worked for decades in the kibbutz’s dairy farm, milking cows.\nHer granddaughter said there was very little left of her home went they returned — and there was no grandma: “Between us, my grandmother was the woman who made that house what it was. My grandmother was a woman who everyone loved. Everyone would pass by her and smile, say hello, in the morning, afternoon and evening.”\nShmil Talker, a longtime Be’eri resident who worked with Ofra at the kibbutz’s animal section, said she “retired long ago, but never missed a day of work, arriving early every morning. Ofra was physically so strong that it was really hard to keep up with her. Despite the attempts to slow down her pace, it was clear that nothing would help and we would all need to match her pace instead.”\nHer son Elad told 103FM Radio after her death was confirmed that there “was some sort of comfort” to find out that she was killed on October 7, “that at least it was over quickly and she didn’t suffer.”\n“She was very close to her grandchildren, she was a very active grandmother, she would take them and do things with them and travel with them also outside of the kibbutz,” said Elad. “At her age, 70, she was still working and carrying things and all the young people were inspired by her… it’s a huge loss.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Did you drink?’ You were a girl with big dreams, that you had only just started to achieve.”\nTheir cousin, Yosi Tal, wrote online that the two sisters “loved to travel the world and embraced life together, always creating lasting memories.

Soon after, terrorists from Gaza appeared shooting everyone they encountered, turning the rave into a killing field.\nAccording to Tomer’s sister, she called their father at 8 a.m. to say that she and her friends were being shot at and that they were hiding.\n“Then at 8:40, she sent a message on our family WhatsApp group saying, ‘We are in the south. We have been shot at for two hours. I love you. I will update you. The IDF is here, but we are stuck,'” her sister said.\nTomer sent her location to her family and then at 9:04 she updated that they continued to be under fire.\n“That was the last we heard from her,” her sister Moran said.\nBar Tomer (Courtesy)\nTomer, an Israeli-German dual citizen, was missing for a week. Her family did not know whether she was dead or taken hostage to Gaza. Seven days after the savage Hamas onslaught, her body was identified and her family was informed. Her friend Noam Shalom was also murdered.\n“I still haven’t processed that Bar is gone. She was so alive and energetic, always smiling and having fun with her friends,” her sister said.\nFollowing high school, Tomer did her military service in the Navy.\nAccording to her sister, she liked to draw and enjoyed being in nature and with animals. She loved to travel and spend time with her family.\nTomer’s grandfather died a month and a half after her murder, causing the family to sit shiva twice in a very short period.\n“Our grandfather wasn’t in good health already, but Bar’s murder definitely led to his deterioration,” Moran Tomer said.\nWhile losing the vibrant youngest member of their family is extremely painful, she said she, her brother, and her parents were strong and would get through it together.\n“I just want everyone to know that Bar was my best friend and sister and that I love her very much,” she said.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Sgt. Binyamin Yehoshua “Benji” Needham, 19, a British-Israeli dual citizen and a soldier in the Combat Engineering Corps’ 601st Battalion, was killed fighting in Gaza on December 3.\nNeedham, who was born in London and moved to Israel when he was 8 years old, lived with his family in Zichron Yaakov. His family said he had been killed just two weeks after his 19th birthday, and only two days after he entered Gaza. He was buried in Zichron Yaakov on December 5.\nA day after his death, the IDF published footage showing Needham’s battalion fighting against Hamas operatives who opened fire at them from a building in the battle that claimed his life.\nHe is survived by his parents, Faye and Amnon, and five older siblings, some of whom live in the UK.\nNeedham was a champion kickboxer, who took second place nationally two years ago. He was remembered by friends and family as being funny, charming and devoted to protecting the country.\nHillary Arnon, his guidance counselor through three years of high school, told Maariv that “it sounds cliche, but Benji really was a special kid. He had a good heart, full of charm. In school, we would call him ‘charmer,’ because he always knew how to act. He was mischievous but never insolent, and you could never get mad at him because every conversation with him would end in a smile.”\nHis sister Orli Ferris told the Mirror news outlet that “he will be missed by all of us and so many others, but we will always make sure we remember him in our hearts. Nothing will be the same now, but we are all very proud of what he did and he was also proud of what he was doing.”\nFerris told the news site that her brother “had just finished his apprenticeship and was doing his professional training. We don’t know the exact details of what happened but he was only in Gaza for two days. He went in on Friday and died Sunday.”\nShe said the whole family is “heartbroken. We shall honor him and keep his memory alive. He was a wonderful boy and everyone who knew him said the same. He died with a pure soul and he died protecting his country.”\nFerris told the Kan public broadcaster that her youngest brother “was the life and soul of our family, of every occasion… he had his whole life in front of him.” She said after the family’s aliyah to Israel a decade ago, “he fit in here like a glove.”\nShe said she last spoke to her brother on Friday, shortly before Shabbat started, on the day he entered Gaza: “He said I’m fine, everything will be OK, you don’t need to worry about me.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He met Danielle Waldman during their army service at the start of what became a six-year relationship.\nThey planned to marry and had attended the Supernova festival with friends. They were found murdered side by side.\nShai is survived by his parents, Yossi and Chen, and a younger brother, Tom.\nYossi told Ynet that after the early morning attack started on October 7 he tried calling his son and Danielle and neither answered. Later Danielle sent a message to the family WhatsApp group “Don’t worry, everything is okay.”\nIt was the last he heard from them. By midday, authorities had traced Noam’s phone to a place deep inside Gaza: “We didn’t know what their fate was,” Yossi said.\nIt later became clear the pair had tried to escape the carnage, driving south from the location of the festival. However, they were ambushed on the road by terrorists. Danielle’s father, Eyal Waldman, told CNN that evidence showed between three and five terrorists attacked the car from two different directions.\nA few days after the attack an IDF delegation arrived at the Shai family home and informed them that Noam’s body had been identified. Minutes later, Danielle’s brother called him and said that her body had also been identified.\n“They were together,” Yossi said.\nShai and Waldman were buried side by side in Kiryat Tivon.\nYossi said that after he completed the weeklong mourning period, he returned to serve as a member of the Kfar Tavor local security team: “This was Noam’s will, to continue in his path and give all my heart to this security activity.”\nShai spent his early years on Kibbutz Ayelet HaShahar but for the last 15 lived with his family in Kfar Tabor, in lower Galilee.\nOn the day of his funeral, residents of Kfar Tabor lined the streets of the community holding Israeli flags as the family drove to the ceremony.\nThe couple’s friend, Matan Eyal, wrote on Instagram that they were “a true example of an accepting and loving relationship.”\n“Everyone who knew them couldn’t miss the special magic they had,” he wrote, noting that he met Shai in 2019 while hanging out with mutual friends in the north, “and since then he became a true friend, a partner, a mentor, a role model and also a therapist.”\nShai was “one of those people who always knows how to say the right thing at the right time… they just wanted to dance and celebrate freedom, who knew they wouldn’t come home.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

His final post, on October 7 at 4:33 a.m. — just two hours before the Hamas onslaught began —  showed him watching a soccer game and eating with a group of other farmhands.\nOn his TikTok account, Kiattisak shared videos of he and other laborers on the farm performing karaoke, sharing meals with Israelis as well as clips of him soulfully playing guitar.\nFollowing the October 7 assault, his family was desperate for any news about him for weeks, and for a while believed he was being held hostage in Gaza. But after about a month, his body was located and his family was informed of his death.\nHis body was sent back to Thailand for burial in early November, returning to the northeastern city of Udo Thani from where he hailed.\nHis sister told The Guardian that after the attack, they called and called his phone but nobody ever answered: “It’s so hard for us not to know – did he get captured, did he run away, what happened to him?”\nKiattisak’s family told The New York Times that he had signed a five-year contract to work in Israel, and had been there already for about four-and-a-half years. They said he went to make money to send back to his family.\nOn November 1, just a few days before his death was confirmed, the newspaper interviewed his father and uncle “in the newly finished house his son financed with earnings from a chicken farm in Israel. A newly purchased car and tractor waited outside, too.”\nHis mother Promma told NBC News that “he built everything, and he did not even get to touch them.”\nKiattisak’s family told the news outlet that once his contract was set to expire next year, he was planning to come home and take over work on the family’s rice farm, so his parents could retire.\n“I’m very sad, so sad that I don’t want to do anything,” said his father, Khamsee.\nHe said he was “so proud” of his son, and had been excited for him to return home. “But he’s no longer here,” he said. “So I will just do what I can.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

His wife, Maya Goren, also 56, was abducted that day and taken hostage in the Gaza Strip.\nOn December 1, the IDF confirmed Maya’s death, but did not provide any details on the date or circumstances. On July 24, 2024, the IDF recovered Maya’s body from the Gaza Strip and returned it to Israel.\nMaya, a teacher in Nir Oz, was setting up the kibbutz’s kindergarten space on the morning of October 7 when the Hamas attack erupted, and she was snatched by the terrorists. Her husband, Avner, was murdered inside the couple’s home.\nAvner was a native of the kibbutz where he was born and raised, while Maya moved there from Ramat Gan to be with him.\nThe couple are survived by four children, Assif, 25, Bar, 23, Gal, 21 and Dekel, 18. Bar and Dekel were in the kibbutz at the time and survived, while Asif and Gal were elsewhere.\nDekel told Ynet that on the morning of the attack, Avner called her and warned her to enter her safe room as the kibbutz was under attack. Dekel said her father communicated to her that terrorists had entered his home. He tried to prevent the invaders from accessing the safe room where he had sought refuge. After that, she did not hear from him again.\nEarlier, Dekel spoke with her mother who said she was hiding under a table as terrorists had entered the kindergarten building. That was her last conversation with Maya.\nHours later IDF soldiers arrived to rescue the kibbutz, and survivors gathered together. Dekel and Bar, who both lived on the kibbutz but not with their parents, held out hope that they would find them.\n“We waited to see our parents arrive, we hoped that perhaps they stopped answering because there was no signal [for their phones] or the battery had run down,” Bar said.\n“Time passed and they didn’t arrive,” added Dekel.\nA week later they were told by Israeli officials that both of their parents’ phones had been traced to inside the Gaza Strip. Two days later, they were informed that Avner’s body had been identified. He was buried in Kibbutz Nir Oz where he lived his entire life.\n“It is the place where Abba [Dad] grew up, his parents founded the kibbutz,” Dekel said. “We knew we would do everything so that our father would be buried in Nir Oz, and so it was.”\nA eulogy posted by the kibbutz recalled Avner as “blessed with talents in many fields: a man of spirit, writing, and knowledge in many areas, who wrote texts for us full of wit and humor that we used to celebrate the holidays.”\nThe kibbutz said Avner was “a significant and influential figure in the kibbutz’s accounting, a true professional. We were privileged in Nir Oz to enjoy the many talents you were blessed with.”\nOn December 1, the kibbutz and the IDF confirmed that Maya had also been killed. A funeral date was not announced at the time, although the family sat shiva, the traditional mourning period.\nGal, their son, wrote after his mother’s death was confirmed that his family had hoped and prayed things would turn out differently.\n“Mom, for more than 56 days you were on the other side of the fence, and our hearts did not stop worrying and missing you. And then we got the news — you are on the other side of the fence, but no longer with us, and our hearts stopped beating. Even now I cannot stop thinking about you,” said Gal.\n“I don’t know when you were no longer with us. I know that already that day you were hurt badly from gunfire but we always tried to hold onto the tiniest hope that maybe, maybe, maybe someone had treated you and saved your life,” Gal continued. “I know that if you were still alive you would have probably gone crazy worrying about us. You would have been insane with worry for your beloved husband, Dad — may his memory be a blessing — who was killed in your warm and loving home and you didn’t even know. You would have thought about our sweet [dog] Scar who was also murdered… you would have been playing worried scenarios in your head about Bar and Dekel, because you wouldn’t know they were alive and with us.”\n“You were always concerned that if you weren’t here, we would be there for each other, and the truth is, if you and Dad could see us now you would be so proud of us,” Gal added. “You raised an incredible family, a family that despite a million and one cracks is still standing. A family that fought so hard to bring you  home to us.”\n“I inherited so many things from you — your pull toward education, your belief in people, your uncompromising desire to give and provide… rest in peace with Dad, allow yourselves to rest and trust us that we are loved and embraced,” said Gal.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

You never know just how many people you may be a lighthouse for. You never know how many people find their way home in even the wildest storms, because you are there.”\nShir’s cousin, Sivane Dahan, told the Global News that she was “the light of her house.

He volunteered for not-for-profit social organizations, following in the footsteps of his father, who was a prominent social activist in Ofakim.\nOn the weekend of the Simhat Torah holiday, his family was hosting a group of children with cancer and complex disabilities, as part of his volunteer efforts. When rocket alert sirens began to wail, Ohayon and his father brought the children into their safe room, before setting out to help their neighbors who didn’t have safe rooms in their houses find shelter.\n“They realized that there was a terrorist in the area and rushed to open the local bomb shelter, so residents could take cover. They managed to break into a nearby shelter, and helped their neighbors inside,” Ohayon’s aunt, Odeliya Ohayon, told the Walla news site.\nAfter helping the sick children and their neighbors, Ohayon and his father headed out amid the deluge of thousands of rockets fired at Israeli towns and cities on the morning of October 7, to help fight the terrorists who had burst across the border into Israel. The two took cover in the yard of a nearby house and tried to hold off gunmen for some 40 minutes, according to Israeli news reports.\nWhen his father was shot in the head, Ohayon tried to treat him, all the while still under fire. Then he was shot and killed.\nMoshe and Eliad Ohayon (courtesy)\nAt his funeral, his sister Shira remembered Ohayon as “a connector, he was a friend to everyone.”\nHis aunt Odelia shared a story: “Just a few months ago, Eliad called his brother Amitai and asked him to come to him because he needed to buy a car. Amitai said he had an exam at the university, but Eliad insisted and said, ‘I found a station wagon.’ Amitai asked, ‘Why do you need such a car? You are a young guy. Why do you need a station wagon?’ And Eliad explained, ‘That way, I’ll have room for four kids with wheelchairs.’ That is our Eliad.

We miss you and it’s hard to believe you are gone. May your memory be a blessing.”\nAnother Facebook page spoke of the Ohayons’ selfless acts on October 7. “The heroic story of the family teaches about the incredible education the children received and the endless heartfelt giving and humility of the family members.

Her funeral was held in Gedera Cemetery on October 11.\nKatabi moved to the kibbutz from her birthplace Gedera to live with her boyfriend and his dog, Luka. Out of the house at the time, her boyfriend was spared from the attack.\n“We were on a video call with her when it happened and suddenly she just disappeared,” said her family in a statement to a local paper. “We didn’t understand what was happening at that moment. The only fear was that some missile wouldn’t fall there. Who would have thought? Who would have believed?”\nAccording to her sister, Katabi especially loved hikes and animals, and nature was an integral part of her life. Even now, she told Israel’s Army Radio, Tehila must be sitting under a tree with friends or running barefoot in the fields.\nKatabi went to school in Gedera, graduating from its regional high school, and attended Tel Hai Academic College in Israel’s north.\n“My heart is torn. I send my condolences from the bottom of my heart to the Katabi family, my dear Daniel and Rachel, for the loss of their beloved daughter Tehila, who was murdered during the cursed surprise attack on Kibbutz Holit,” said Yoel Gamliel, the head of Gedera’s regional council.\nThe couple’s dog Luka was alongside Katabi at the time of the attack but survived and was found in a nearby car by the army two days later in a malnourished state. After being taken to a veterinarian, Luka was reunited with her grieving owner.\n“There are no words in the world that can describe what kind of person you were,” wrote Katabi’s sister, Yarden Vanzovski, on Facebook. “And there are no words to describe the huge void you left for us.

Asaf Hamami, 41, from Kiryat Ono, the commander of the Gaza Division’s Southern Brigade, was killed fighting Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Nirim on the morning of October 7, during the terror group’s onslaught on southern Israel.\nFor eight weeks he was considered a Hamas hostage, until the IDF confirmed his death on December 2, officially listing his status as a “fallen IDF soldier held captive by a terror group” and his date of death as October 7.\nHamami’s death was declared by the chief rabbi, based on findings obtained by the military in the Gaza Strip. The findings allowed Hamami to have a funeral according to halacha, or Jewish law, but his body remains in Gaza.\nHamami is survived by his wife Saphir and their three children, and his parents, Clara and Ilan.\nOn the morning of October 7, as Hamas launched its assault, Hamami was spending Shabbat at the Gaza Divison base near the border with his 5-year-old son, Alon. Hamami handed his son to other soldiers to take him to a safe place and set out to battle the terrorists.\nHamami was remembered by his family and friends as a funny and witty officer, always wanting to be first, and his love for his family.\nCol. Asaf Hamami’s wife Saphir and son Alon mourn during his funeral in Kiryat Shaul Cemetery in Tel Aviv, December 4, 2023, (Miriam Alster/Flash90)\nThe commander of the Gaza Division, Brig. Gen. Avi Rosenfeld, eulogized him at his funeral, saying: “You were purely a human being, purely a commander, purely a warrior.”\n“The way you fought and fell defined who you were. Family was so important to you, every time you talked about them it was hard to miss the smile and the sparkle in your eyes. Perhaps your consolation is that he fell as a hero,” Rosenfeld said.\nHamami’s wife, Saphir, said he was “the perfect, most suitable partner for me. The deal between us was that you take care of the country and I take care of everything else.”\n“Not many know how funny you are, how witty you are. Thank you my love for 17 years of great love. Thank you for the children, thank you for a whole life. My heart is broken and crushed, but also at peace with your decision, because what hurts me so much today is also what made me fall in love with you,” she added.\nHis mother, Clara said she recalled when Hamami was first drafted to the military to the Givati Infantry Brigade in 2001. “How much you wanted to grow up and join the army. You were so excited when you wore the green army uniform,” she said. “You considered yourself equal among equals… you did not ask for glory and honor.”\nHamami’s father, Ilan, said he always “strove to be first.”\n“You were born to be a good friend and a pleasant person. When you enlisted, you joined the Givati Brigade. We were all very proud of you and knew that there was a commander with values like yours in the army who cares for his soldiers and subordinates,” he said.\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamami never hesitated. “Those who knew Assaf, as a subordinate, a commander, and a friend, always knew that where danger lurks and it is necessary to engage, that is exactly where Hamami would be found.”\n“That’s where he was there during his 22 years of service in the IDF, and he was also there on the day the war started on October 7. As soon as word of the terror onslaught became known, Hamami did not hesitate for a moment,” Gallant said.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

After his death, his organs were donated and saved the lives of six others.\n“He didn’t think twice about the importance of donating his organs. That was Yehonatan.

She dreamed of being famous and being an influencer — Tamar, even on those goals you can put a big checkmark.”\n“The fact that we lost you due to fears and anxiety which spiraled out of control before we could understand the intensity of the problem will stay with us for our entire lives,” he said. “I promise we will do everything to memoralize you everywhere we go.”\nAvi told the Kan public broadcaster that Tamar was deeply panicked from seeing the news of everything going on around the country and from weeks of rocket attacks on the southern city where she lived. He called on parents to make sure their children were coping with the situation.\n“We have to speak to our children, to listen to them, to check if they need strengthening, a hug, to get the fear out of their hearts, so they don’t end up like our Tamar, who was so full of anixety and fear that her heart gave out.”\nHer brother Itzik said at her funeral that he wanted to “say goodbye before you go. I love you so much, I miss you so much, we’ll be together forever.”\nMarking 30 days since her death, the women’s Maccabi Ironi Ashdod soccer team added her name to their logos and jerseys to memorialize the young girl — who loved to play the sport with her brother and dreamed one day of joining a team herself.\nTamar’s aunt, Haya Simel, wrote on Facebook that she remembered Tamar as an excellent student, an exuberant dancer and a child filled with joy and love.\nWhen Tamar was born, “we received a beauty queen baby, the joy was enormous and the happiness huge,” wrote Simel. “Your love and your warmth were huge even for someone you’d only just met. You were were an excellent student… you always had a glowing face and smile full of light.”\n“We keep sitting and waiting for the door to open or look out the window for you to call us to come downstairs — we can’t comprehend what happened, it feels like a dream, but it’s really a nightmare,” added Simel. “Tamari, our princess, our love, you were light and happiness and beauty and warmth, with a pure heart we will remember forever.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He is survived by his wife, Hadas, five children, Be’eri, Halel, Tal, Shira, and Neta, his parents, Yaakov and Ruhama, and his siblings.\n“Yossi was a beloved administrator, a first-rate educator, a man of the people, full of love and giving, who saw in front of him the path to doing good and creating a brighter and better world,” said the CEO of the ORT network, Tzvika Peleg. “The ORT family will remember Yossi and will continue to integrate his values and faith and desire to complete and enhance his educational life’s work.”\nHershkovitz was killed alongside his fellow reservists and comrades Maj. (res.) Moshe Yedidyah Leiter, 39, Master Sgt. (res.) Matan Meir, and Master Sgt. (res.) Sergey Shmerkin.\nThe final letter he wrote to his parents, while inside Gaza just days before his death, circulated online after he was killed: “You raised me to give without receiving, and not out of habit, and thank God I am privileged to be part on an incredible nation of incredible people who give from all their soul to the nation.” Hershkovitz added: “How much slander was said about this nation over the past year, and how much was it all a lie. We are all here fighting shoulder to shoulder, as one people with one heart.”\nFamily and friends of Yossi Hershkovitz mourn at his funeral at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem on November 12, 2023.

Maj. (res.) Yossi Hershkovitz, who fell in battle in Gaza,” the school wrote in a statement on social media. “Yossi was the much admired principal of the Ort Pelech Boys’ School in Jerusalem… our thoughts are with his wife Hadas and their five children.

You helped me with everything… send me strength to live, to be happy, to make jokes the way only you knew how… I’ll miss everything — the hug you would give me, the way you said you would always love me, always.”\nShe said that just a day before he was killed, “when I was in school they told me that my dad was coming to visit.

Shlomi called Roi, who was at the Supernova festival, and warned him to get out as fast as possible, saving his life.\nIdo told Ynet that Ayelet was murdered inside her safe room, along with both of her dogs, while Shlomi was killed after he went out with his weapon and tried to fight them off.\n“They were just incredible people, simple as that,” wrote Tzuri. “Lighthearted and pleasant, never made an issue out of anything in life. They did everything with good intentions and a lot of love. They loved people, nature, travel and animals. They were always surrounded by friends and family.”\nTzuri added that “their love could be seen in their eyes, in every conversation. Their gaze was always simple and warm, embracing, interested. A special, beloved couple.”\nThe couple’s friend and neighbor Galit B’dil remembered Ayelet as effortlessly beautiful and cool.\n“A youthful woman, untouched by age, beautiful on the outside and so beautiful on the inside,” B’dil wrote on Facebook. “Simple, modest, talented and creative, unbelievably generous — no matter what was going on inside she was always cool. Almost always barefoot with straight hair in a ponytail and jeans, no jeans or makeup, no nail polish — just you, as nature created, the same as your personality, with no masks or affectations.”\nB’dil described Shlomi as “such a sweet man — you would tell me that he melts from every abandoned kitten or dog – ‘He can’t help it, he’s driving me crazy,'” Ayelet would say. “You were a couple who looked like one person, tall, barefoot, with a shy smile and a calm soul, always united, quiet, modest.”\nKobi Paz, Shlomi’s cousin, described him as the paratrooper, hero, salt of the earth,” noting how both members of the couple shot at their attackers, fighting back before ultimately succumbing. “The heart shatters into a million pieces. May their memory be a blessing.”\nEtty Molcho, Shlomi’s sister, visited their graves on the 30-day anniversary of their death: “In front of the dunes that my one and only brother Shlomi, and my one sister-in-law Ayelet, lived and breathed and loved so much,” she wrote on Facebook, sharing a photo of their gravestones.\n“My beloved Shlomi and Ayelet were connected to me in every limb of my body.

Founded in 1951 by a Zionist youth movement, Kissufim attracted members from the United States and Latin American countries.\nSpanish media reported that Illarramendi and Garcovich met 15 years ago. During the Hamas attack, they were at their home and attempted to alert family members from their bunker, as confirmed by Israeli authorities.\nGarcovich’s father, Danny Garcovich, recounted their last phone conversation on that fateful Saturday. His daughter reported Arabic-speaking intruders were “destroying everything” in their house. Around 12:30 p.m., their communication abruptly ended after Dafna Garcovich sent a series of desperate messages for help.\nInon Hefer, a close friend of the couple, shared with El Español, a Spanish newspaper, his final conversation with Illarramendi. Illarramendi had mentioned returning home early from a party due to nearby gunfire. Shortly after, he messaged that they needed to maintain silence, fearing a break-in.\nIllarramendi, a native of Spain’s Basque Country, was officially declared deceased by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Rodica Radian-Gordon, the Spanish ambassador in Tel Aviv, expressed her profound sorrow over Iván’s murder on X (formerly Twitter).\nDafna Garcovich, born in San Felipe, Chile, just north of Santiago, moved to Israel with her family as a child in 1984 and held Israeli citizenship. During the attack, her parents, living nearby, managed to seek refuge in their bunker.\nThe Israeli embassy in Madrid disclosed that Iván and Dafna were found deceased together in their home.\nThe couple had separate funerals. Illarramendi’s body was sent to Spain, while Garcovich was laid to rest in Israel.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Yam Goldstein-Almog, 20, were murdered by Hamas terrorists in their home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7.\nThe family’s mother, Chen, and their three younger children, Agam, 17, Gal, 11 and Tal, 9, were all kidnapped and taken to Gaza by Hamas. On November 26, they were released from Gaza and returned to Israel.\nWhen the rest of the family returned home, their relatives found out that Chen had seen Nadav and Yam killed before she and the other kids were taken captive. They were relieved, in a sense, to not have to be the ones to break the news.\nVarda Goldstein, Nadav’s mother and Yam’s grandmother, said after the rest of the family’s return that “it’s so exciting to see the kids, to touch them, to see that they’re in good shape and they look good and are smiling. But on the other hand, we need to have an emotional balance with the fact that there are also family members who were murdered.”\nIn addition to his wife and three of his children, Nadav is also survived by his sisters, Inbar and Naama, and his parents, Varda and David Goldstein.\nThe family didn’t want to bury Nadav and Yam — who were identified several days after the massacre — until they knew what had happened to Chen, Agam, Gal and Tal. It took another 10 days before the family discovered Chen and her three children were officially considered hostages in Gaza, according to army intelligence.\nOn October 23, they buried Nadav and Yam in Kibbutz Shefayim, where most Kfar Aza residents were evacuated. The funeral was held, with cruel irony, on Chen’s birthday.\nSix members of the Goldstein-Almog family from Kibbutz Kfar Aza. (L-R): Agam, 17, Gal, 11, Nadav (deceased), Chen, 48, Tal, 11 and Yam (deceased). Four members were released on November 26, 2023. (Courtesy)\nChen and Nadav were high school sweethearts who met when they were 14, married young and made their home in Kfar Aza, a place they never thought about leaving, no matter what was happening in the Gaza border community.\n“My brother-in-law always said, ‘You don’t leave your home,’” said Omri Almog, Chen’s sister. He recalled that when visiting his brother-in-law in intensive care over the summer after a riding accident, Nadav told him, “Hope dies last.”\nNadav was remembered by family and friends as a dedicated athlete, who competed in triathlons, and was delivered a recent setback following his accident. By day he was the vice president of business development at Kafrit Industries, Kfar Aza’s publicly traded plastic manufacturing company.\nFamily said that Nadav was likely hobbled by his accident on the day of the attack, and that Yam tried desperately to reach out for help, texting the army, the police and anyone she could reach trying to get help before she was murdered.\nYam was recalled as devoted to her military service, where she worked as acommander in the Computer Service Directorate. In the end, her body was identified by her butterfly tattoo, said family.\nNadav’s sister, Inbar Goldstein, told the Kan public broadcaster that her oldest brother was “talented, smart and beautiful… he was a role model – the best I could have had.”\nAt their funeral, Inbar recalled Yam as someone who “if anybody needed help, she was the first to be there.”\nVarda, Nadav’s mother, shared on Facebook the eulogy she wrote for her son and granddaughter.\n“My beloved family, my beautiful son, my gorgeous granddaughter, you are my glorious heroes,” she wrote. “Nadav and Yam, beautiful as the glow of the heavens, bereft of all evil. Their voices fell silent. Our most precious murdered, looted, taken captive.\nVarda wrote that her son and granddaughter “gave us the privilege of being parents, gave us a whole life of love and laughters and tears, a whole family happy and joyous, sometimes in pain, sometimes crying… give me one more magical moment together.

The organization’s volunteers are known for attending such types of parties and gatherings in their recognizable blue shirts, which read “Good Guy,” to provide services to anyone experiencing distress, which can be common at raves where drug use is widespread.\nThere were nine Elem volunteers at the Supernova music festival near Re’im on the morning of October 7. Only six made it out alive.\nAlongside, Richter, volunteers Lior Hadad Atias and Sigal Levi were also murdered.\nRichter is survived by his partner, Doron Yehudai, his two daughters, and his mother, Elli. He was buried on October 15.\nKnown to his friends as “Shafik,” Richter was a devoted follower of the Indian mystic and yogi Sadhguru, and even translated his book, “Inner Engineering,” into Hebrew, with the translated edition published earlier this year.\nHis cousin, Ilan Richter, wrote on Facebook that he was grateful to have seen him just two weeks before he was killed.\n“How lucky I am that we had a moment like that,” he wrote. “Two weeks ago. How much I loved that moment, to sit next to you, side by side, both of our children and all the family around, to talk.”\n“How much that luck is missing, for all of us, since Saturday morning,” he added. “I love you Shafik. A lot. I will miss you, I will miss you so much.”\nMoshe Elad, the director of Elem’s “Good Guy” project, told Ma’ariv that Richter had been with them for around two years.\n“People always felt comfortable talking to him and opening up to him,” said Elad. “He came to our world from the trance scene. It’s very painful to lose friends who came to do good and to help.”\nAnat Zayit wrote on Facebook that she knew Richter from their time together volunteering with Elem.\n“May his memory and life’s work be a blessing,” she wrote. “My heart is broken into a million pieces. We lost one (of many) of the good guys. Rest in peace, dear Yonatan. You are in our hearts… at his funeral, I will wear my blue shirt in his honor.”\nThe Elem organization said that Richter was a good guy — “a good guy with a big heart and tremendous strengths, with a smile, a hug, authenticity and love for everyone. We don’t have enough words to describe this horrible pain.”\n“I’m sorry to Yonatan, a good guy like you — sorry that you left us too early when you tried to be a safe anchor for partygoers. Rest in peace.”\nKobi Richter, his uncle, wrote on Facebook that he could not understand how the grass continued to grow, the flowers bloom, the sun set while the world was robbed of his nephew.\n“How to explain to them that would cannot continue as if nothing has fallen, as if no man has fallen,” he wrote. “When a music festival turned into a slaughter festival with a concentration of evil, the harmony ceased, and so did you. The beach lilies turned into a funeral wreath.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

The soldier said Saudyan, the senior officer on duty at the Iron Dome battery, was the first to spot the wave of rockets on the screen, as they jumped into action to counter an attack like they’d never seen before.\n“It was my first time in a real event of rockets, and Sahar rushed to calm me down, to put a hand on my shoulder, to give me the strength to intercept rocket after rocket in the first minutes,” recounted A. to Ynet.\nSeveral hours later, Saudyan and two other IDF soldiers — Sgt. Nativ Kuzaro, 21, and Sgt. Binyamin Gavriel Yona, 19 — left to restock the Iron Dome battery with interceptor missiles. The missiles are stored nearby, but not at the battery itself.\nAll three were shot dead in their vehicle. Their bodies were recovered and identified several days later. They were the first ever Iron Dome battery operators to be killed in battle.\nStav Saudyan, Sahar’s sister, told Channel 13 news that she texted them that morning, shortly after 7 a.m., “‘Take care of yourselves, everything is OK, I’m protecting you — we’ll talk when I can.’ She wrote in the family group that we can be proud of her. We’re absolutely proud of her.”\nStav said that Sahar is her only sister, “and we were very, very close.”\nShe said all three of the fallen soldiers “were really heroes because they knew what they were walking into and they went anyway, so that rockets wouldn’t fall on Israel. Not on their watch.”\nSahar’s brother, Dvir Saudyan, wrote on Facebook that his sister was a hero.\n“My happiness, the light in our home, the most precious thing to me in the world, went like a hero to defend the residents of the south,” he wrote. “If only I could give her my own heart now.”\n“I will remember you as the twin of my heart, who was a role model to be admired, with a huge and good heart and endless generosity.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

At around 10:20 a.m. he wrote me a message, ‘I’m out, love you, Re’im area.’”\nBorn in Ma’alot, Ben Moshe had been on a military track since his adolescence. After graduating from the Junior Command Military Academy, an army boarding school in Haifa, he was drafted into the Paratroopers Brigade, where he served as a commander.\n“Ariel was born with a halo — I say this before and I say this after [his death],” said his mother, Galit Waldman in an interview with Channel 12. “I put all of my love onto him, he was the spotlight of the house and I understood this from the day he was born. He had an aura. I believed that he would become IDF Chief of Staff.”\nBy the evening of October 7, Ben Moshe had retaken almost all of Re’im with his patrol and planned to detonate the last house containing Hamas terrorists. Upon learning that a child still remained in the house, Ben Moshe called off the explosion and opted instead to enter the building.\nWhen Ben Moshe’s deputy, who was supposed to go in first, ran out of ammunition, he took his place and was soon shot in the leg.\nShavit Ben Moshe, an IDF paratrooper, also fought in the south that day and heard of his brother’s death amid intense fighting in Kibbutz Holit. After sustaining a severe injury and being evacuated to Soroka Medical Center, Shavit reunited with his mother three days later, at his elder brother’s funeral in Haifa.\nBen Moshe is survived by his mother Galit, two younger brothers Shavit and Adar, and his wife Yuval.\n“Ariel really tried to prepare me. He really tried to explain to me what I was getting into when I married him and told me upfront that ‘I might be playing with fire,’” said Yuval. “I heard, but I didn’t listen. I feel like I’ve lived the best life in the world until age 27, and then cut. We didn’t have time to have children, we didn’t have time to build a house.

    "story": "Narkis Hand, 54, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in her home in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7.\nFamily members said that her body was found on the kibbutz near her mother’s house, after they believed she climbed out the window of her own home and tried to flee, but was shot dead. Hand’s mother, Simcha, survived.\nHand, a native of the kibbutz, is survived by her adult son Eden and daughter Natali, whom she had with her ex-husband Tom Hand, mother Simcha, as well as her siblings.\nShe also helped raise 9-year-old Emily Hand, the daughter of her ex-husband from his subsequent second marriage, whose mother died when she was a toddler. Emily was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7 and released on November 25.\n“My mother was a really wonderful woman,” Natali told the La’Isha magazine. “Very sensitive, very empathetic — she did everything for me. Just a perfect mother.”\nNatali said that when Emily’s mother died of cancer, “My mother didn’t think it was OK for a girl that age to live without a mother… Emily would sleep sometimes with dad and sometimes with mom, she had her own room and closet at mom’s house too,” said Natali, noting that Narkis also helped her with schoolwork since Tom, a non-Jewish Irish native, did not read or speak Hebrew.\n“Emily remembers her biological mother, but she really loved my mother and saw her as a second mother. She would call her ‘Kisi,'” recalled Natali.\nTom Hand told AP that “Emily loved cooking so Emily and Natali would cook together. Narkis really became Emily’s second mother. Even Narkis’s mother, she became a second grandmother.”\nFriends and family recalled Narkis as a lover of dance, devoted and caring mother, and travel aficionado.\nHer friend Liraz Sheffer Hadaf recalled sitting on Narkis’s balcony “for coffee and gossip” just a day before the October 7 onslaught.\n“We had plans to travel around the world for at least the next decade,” she wrote. “I’m not sure I can make all our plans come true without you. I miss you.”\nAn obituary for Hand posted on the Kibbutz Be’eri website described her as a “caring mother whose children were very close to her. Taking care of Natali and Eden filled her life with joy and meaning,” and she also took close care of her mother as well as her aunt as they aged.\n“Narkis surrounded herself with all of her family and she was the go-to address for everyone,” the kibbutz obituary read. “But she didn’t forget herself, and she returned to dance with the teacher who taught her in her youth, for her body and for her soul — which remained the soul of a dancer.”\n“Narkis, you will be missed by us so much. We, the members of Kibbutz Be’eri who survived the horror, will remember you always as wonderfully as you were, we will try to walk in your footsteps and immortalize the values that you stuck to your whole life, until your death.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Motti Zoherman, 73, from Tel Aviv, was murdered at the Supernova music festival near Re’im on October 7.\nHe was survived by his son, Ben, daughter, Tal, a number of grandchildren and his siblings Rani and Tzvika.\nZoherman is remembered as a larger-than-life figure who lived for parties and raves even into his seventh decade on Earth and was known for a large colorful tattoo on his stomach — which was used to identify his body after death.\n“He lived within a very narrow budget — he lived a simple life in order to allow himself the budget for travel and the life he chose,” his son, Ben, told Ynet. “He very much thought out his path.”\nBen said that when the family recovered Motti’s cellphone, they found the very last photo he took, at 6:41 a.m. on October 7, of Iron Dome interceptions of missiles from Gaza over the skies of the festival.\n“Motti, beautiful soul, heart of gold… one of many, too many, lost beloved brothers and sisters,” wrote his friend Simona Bassi on Facebook. “Motti, may your memory be a blessing, may you dance in the Light now.”\nZoherman’s friend Tal Amit remembered him as “the pillar of fire of a life of freedom, parties and festivals, lived a high-octane life, was modest and kind, and above all happy and good-hearted. A special man with an old soul who lived life to the fullest.”\nHis friend Julia Verner eulogized her “dear and beloved friend” on Facebook.\n“His murder has turned the world into a less good place,” she wrote. “I met Motti Zoherman more than 20 years ago, he was a dream man, with a rare beauty, wisdom and love for the world. Over the years I learned so much from him, both about the here and now and also about the spiritual world and the ‘different’ and the ‘other.'”\nVerner said that Zoherman was “a man who changed his life and also the lives of many people around him. He gave up on the material world and chose light, love, freedom, searched for meaning in travels around the world and within his soul, and found answers that only a man who did not know fear could reach.”\nShe wrote that he “loved his children more than anything, and was the best dad I knew.”\nZoherman survived colon cancer 15 years ago, and the experience changed his life path, as he closed his longtime shoe store and decided to live a more spiritual life, spending much of his time in India, his family and friends said.\nBen told Ynet that he and his sister “had a colorful father, not conventional, but wonderful… my father drew a lot of people to him, a lot of young people who wanted to be infected with his joy for life.”\nHis son said that there is “something comforting about the fact that Dad was happy in the final hours of his life. We are very sad that Dad was murdered in such a cruel way, but at least we know he was in the place he wanted to be — happy and dancing and living a full life. Dad lived every day to the edge, as if it was his last day.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Noa Marciano, 19, was killed by Hamas terrorists in captivity in Gaza at some point in November, after she was taken hostage on October 7 from the Nahal Oz IDF base near Gaza, where she served as an observation soldier in the Border Defense Corps’s 414th unit.\nIn an interview with Ynet a few weeks after she was kidnapped, her mother, Adi said she wanted Noa to know “that I miss her and want her to come home. My instincts tell me that she is still alive. She’s probably watching over the little kids.” She worried, she said, “does she have her glasses? Are they hurting her?”\nIDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said that Marciano was wounded by an IDF airstrike on November 9, while held in Gaza, and later taken to Shifa, where she was murdered.\nHagari said that the pathology report “states Noa was injured by the strike, but not in a life-threatening manner,” contrary to the false Hamas claim that she was killed in a strike. “According to intelligence information, Noa was taken inside the walls of Shifa Hospital, where she was murdered by a Hamas terrorist.”\nOn November 14, the army declared her dead, and on November 16, they announced that they had recovered her body and brought it back to Israel. She was laid to rest in Modiin on November 17.\nShe is survived by her mother, Adi, father, Avi, and younger siblings Yuval, Itay and Hadar.\nAt her funeral, Adi apologized to her daughter for being unable to return her home.\n“We tried everything for 40 days. We turned over every stone and climbed every tree,” she said. “You protected us, and we didn’t protect you.”\nShe recalled her daughter being a “girl of music and literature, a girl of dimples and smiles, a girl of love,” who wanted to serve her country.\nNoa’s father said he had been confronted with the question “What do you need?” over the past few weeks.\n“I answered that I have everything, and yet I have nothing. I don’t have joy or comfort. Now I have an angel named Noa. I promise you that the way you wanted to lead, we will carry on and not stop. I thank you for being a perfect girl. We love you endlessly and will never forget you,” he said.\nYuval, Noa’s sister, lamented that she had bought a birthday present for her, which was “waiting in your room, in wrapping.”\n“I am proud of you, I am happy you cared, that you did what was good for you, that you danced, sang, and you fulfilled yourself like there was no tomorrow.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

However, nearly two weeks later, news came that the bodies of the five family members were discovered and identified.\nThe family was laid to rest in a joint ceremony at Moshav Hogla in the Hefer Valley.\nThe sole survivor from the Bira family was Yahav, the older brother of Tahir and Tahel.\nJust a month prior to the attack, Oron and Yasmin had traveled to Portugal to secure their Portuguese passports and apply for their children.\nYasmin’s twin sister, Dalia Fishman, recounted their last conversation. Speaking to the Argentine press, Fishman recalled Yasmin’s WhatsApp message on the morning of the attack, revealing the family was hiding in a bunker as “five terrorists” invaded the kibbutz. Yasmin expressed her fear during that harrowing time.\nUnbeknownst to Yasmin at that point, the number of terrorists storming the kibbutz was over 100.\nIn an interview with Portugal’s SIC Noticias, Tal and Oron’s sister, Batia Bira, compared that day’s terror to the Holocaust. She described the family’s desperate attempt to remain silent and hidden in darkness to avoid detection.

When they awoke from the air raid sirens Saturday morning, they all gathered together in one room. Then they heard gunshots outside and panicked, and later heard terrorists trying to break into their home.\nOne by one 10 of them — including a newborn baby — headed out the window, crossed to their neighbor’s roof and hid in an enclosure that housed a solar water heater. Only Ariel stayed behind, picking up a metal rod in the room to try and fight off the invading terrorists. Ultimately, he was shot dead while trying to escape out the window. The rest of his family survived and were rescued from the roof hours later, discovering only then that Ariel had been killed just meters away.\n“It’s a tragic miracle,” his sister-in-law, Michal, who was with Ariel and his family in Ofakim, told the Walla news site. “We were at one funeral instead of 11. The ending is sad and happy together,” she said, describing Ariel as “the little brother and the happiest and funniest in the family.”\nTaliya Bilya, his cousin, wrote on Instagram that he was “the kind of guy whose smile never left his face, Ariel was always there for everyone and the first to help.”\nAriel’s brother, Guy Bilya, who was among those hiding on the roof, told Channel 13 news that he was the life of every party: “He would always make every event happier, every family gathering, he would infuse it with his joy, and his fun and his lightheardness and his chill.”\nHis wife, Shoshana, wrote on Facebook that she was desperately waiting to see him again, praying every day for his return.\n“I’m waiting for you, waiting to see you.

He was killed when his vehicle was hit by an RPG fired by Hamas. Davidov also did not make it out alive.\nBuzukashvili is survived by his wife, Tali, and their three children, Orel, 24, Liel, 21 and Noa, 15.\nLiel, who is serving in the Border Police, told Channel 12 news that he was “truly a warrior in his heart. The fighter that I am today is only because of him.”\nBoth father and daughter set out to the front lines together on Saturday morning as the Hamas onslaught began. “We began to just see cars with people shot inside them,” she recalled. “We were driving in between bodies.” They also saw terrorists along the streets and fired at them, managing to take out a few, and started to pick up the wounded and those fleeing.\nFirst Sgt. Yisrael Solomini told the TV station that “he was simply a hero. If Bazuka hadn’t shown up with his strength,” many more people would be dead, including five partygoers who had met up with Liel two weeks later to relive the moment. “If he’d arrived two minutes later we’d be eulogizing them.”\nCommander Itzik Buzukashvili and his daughter, Staff Sgt. Liel Buzukashvili (Courtesy)\nPolice Sgt. Maj. Yigal Zinger, who himself saved hundreds, was wounded and rescued by Buzukashvili. From his hospital bed, he tearfully recounted the moment that “Bazuka showed up in a reinforced jeep, he was in the jeep with his daughter… at the very last second they saved me.”\nBuzukashvili then headed further toward the Gaza border, and this time refused to let Liel join. “We argued and he said no, you’re staying here. He knew what they were about to face… I gave him a kiss, closed the door, and that’s the last time I saw him.”\nShe remained nearby and was listening on police radios when news came that he had been fatally wounded. Even though she struggled to accept such a possibility, “in my head I said, even if Dad is not here with me, I’ll do everything to keep on fighting,” and she continued on to Ofakim to battle terrorists.\nChief Inspector Or Yosef, who was in the car when Buzukashvili and another police officer were killed and was himself wounded, said, “when you go in after him, you feel the most protected in the world. Because you’re going in behind the strongest, most professional person I’d ever met.”\nAt his funeral, many spoke of his bravery and composure under fire.\n“You halted a blitz as you were rescuing the wounded and other police officers, including your friend Ge-ar,” recounted Buzukashvili’s deputy, Mani Ohayon, at his funeral, according to Ynet. “In your life and your death, you were not parted. My dear commander, your courage guided you like an arrow. Much will still be said about your heroism.”\nIsrael Police Chief Kobi Shabtai said at his funeral that it was personally “very difficult to stand here right now, in front of an open grave. I am proud, proud that these are the commanders of the Israel Police.”\nWife Tali, vowed to memorialize her husband “by telling his story, all of his stories.”\nShe told a local Beersheba news site that she was able to get out of bed in the morning “only because of the strength Itzik gave me… he wouldn’t want us to fall apart, he’d want us to be united, to be one loving family hugging each other. It’s important to me to memorialize his story so that people know what a hero he was that he saved lives, that we’re still here because of him.”\n“He saved my life when he left me there at that intersection,” said Liel. “If we had both been killed, the family would not be able to handle the pain.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Gabay, a recent law school graduate who had been working at the party, was last seen taking shelter at a police command post after being shot in the leg on the morning of October 7.\nShe called her mother at 6:40 a.m., telling her about the stream of rockets and asking what she should do, according to her older brother, Aviel Gabay, in a lengthy video posted on social media. She was in her car at the time, and her mother told her to pull over and find a secure place. She found a field shelter near Kibbutz Alumim and went there, not yet knowing at the time there were terrorists gunning down partygoers in addition to the rockets.\nTerrorists threw grenades into the shelter, according to Gabay’s two friends who stayed in the shelter and survived, each one losing a leg. Gabay was pulled out of the shelter and appeared to have returned to her car, where she was shot. She made her way to a paramedic who took her to the police command post.\nHer family and friends remembered her as devoted to her dog Alpha, loving to attend desert festivals and raves, and a fan of global travel.\n“She knows everyone,” said Aviel while she was still missing. “We keep meeting people at the rallies who see her photo and know her from Costa Rica, or the army or their studies. She cleans beaches and saves cats and dogs. I want to believe she’ll continue doing all of that.”\nGabay was laid to rest in Yokne’am on November 23, a week before she would have turned 26.\nHer sister, Nitzan, said at the funeral, “Everyone is waiting to hear what I have to say about you, but how could I begin to sum you up? You were the one who was good with words, and you’re not here now.”\n“We were sisters by the book — we’d fight, laugh, blow up, then ask for forgiveness, or just pretend nothing happened,” she said. “We’d steal clothes from each other, or more accurately, you from me… the hole you have left cannot be filled. What am I supposed to do now?”\nShani’s mother, Rachel, also eulogized her daughter at the funeral.\n“I’m sorry that I couldn’t direct you what to do in that moment,” her mother wept. “I’m sorry I didn’t really understand what happened then… how much I hoped, how much I prayed.”\n“I thought you were on vacation and coming back soon, but from this trip you will never return,” she added. “I’ve met so many people who knew you, you connected to everyone, got along with everyone.”\nHer mother said she wishes “I could wake you up in the morning for work and you’ll be irritated and ask for a few more minutes to sleep… and make you a sandwich to eat on the train on the way, and you’ll send me a text, ‘Thanks mom, it was really tasty.'”\n“My beautiful girl, now you really are my angel.

Help.”\nDaria and Lavi were rescued after 9 hours in the safe room, and 24 hours after the nightmare began they were finally reunited with their mother.\nReut told the La’Isha magazine that Daria told her “that her father tried to attack the terrorists with an axe to try and protect her and her brother, but the terrorists killed him and also his girlfriend, Stav, who also tried to protect them.”\nDvir, a chocolatier with his own chocolate shop and cafe in the nearby Kibbutz Magen, was recalled as a lifetime chocolate devotee and a well-known character in the region.\nDvir’s friend, Avi Dabush, remembered him on Facebook as a “gifted chocolatier who lit up the region” with his cafe. “He was also uniquely funny and very caring and connected. A very well-known and beloved figure in the region.”\nKimhi worked at a gym in the Eshkol region, which memorialized her as a sunny and beloved employee.\n“How can it be that such a pure person ended their life in such a cruel way,” the company wrote in a Facebook post. “There’s no doubt you left your mark here, you were beloved by everyone with no exception, from the young kids who came straight from school to the longtime members whom you loved to spend time with and give your wisdom.”\nThey said she was particularly kind to their elderly members, “with patience and respect, whether it was a hug or a conversation, dear Stav was there.”\nYuval Abramovitz wrote on Facebook that every meeting with Dvir “always included devouring a high-quality chocolate he made himself.”\n“Dvir, thanks for all the chocolates, the chips and the sweet potatoes as well as the updates on the latest books you read about World War II. Tragically you too became a war hero.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Adiel Twito, 32 of Petah Tikva, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nIn the days after the assault, Twito was thought to be held captive in Gaza, since both her car and her cellphone were traced to there, but ultimately her body was found and she was buried in Petah Tikva on October 16.\nShe is survived by her parents, Yoram and Ilana, and siblings Liraz, Netanel, Aviran and Mor.\nTwito, a private chef and a member of the LGBTQ community, was best known for being a finalist on the second season of Israel’s “My Kitchen Rules,” which aired in 2020.\nCelebrity chief Haim Cohen, who served as a judge on the show and later worked with Twito, recalled her love for the culinary world.\n“We met Adiel when she was in a good place in her life, she was happy, she loved working in the kitchen,” said Cohen. “She loved hosting people and we saw that in her approach to food and her generosity. She loved to cook for others and you could see that in her.”\nHer sister, Liraz, told the Mako news site that Adiel was one-of-a-kind.\n“All my sister did was good, she had a huge heart,” said Liraz. “She was warm, so good-hearted, because of this she was always surrounded by people who loved her so much. She was very beloved and not at all conventional. It’s important to me that we talk about her magic, how much she’s loved.”\nHer friend Reut started a project in Adiel’s name, selling aprons for NIS 50 with a drawing of the late chef and the proceeds going toward refurbishing and renovating the destroyed kibbutz dining hall in Be’eri: “The kitchen was Adiel’s entire world, days and nights she would be found there, through cooking she expressed herself.”\nHer close friend, Tali Moas, wrote on Instagram a month after Adiel’s death that she still couldn’t come to terms with the loss. She said that she had no idea why Twito was attending the rave, which wasn’t generally her scene, “and I will probably never know.”\n“How big and wide your heart was — and it’s not just more nice words, it was so true about you,” wrote Moas. “How much you always only wanted to help and give, and even when you had bad points in life, you would always put yourself aside and try to help.”\nMoas wrote that “what I loved most about you was your joy for life and the lightheartnedess that was in you — thank you for all my incredible experiences with you in Israel and abroad. Thank you for the crazy amounts of the tastiest food I’ve eaten — especially the fish you made on Fridays, which you would always make because you knew how much I looked forward to it. Now I need to be strong because I have an important job — to memorialize you exactly how you would want and exactly how you deserve.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

I’m wishing to hear you, to hug you, I miss you, my daughter.”\nHer aunt, Toby, told La’isha magazine that she got to spend a few hours with Price in September, a month before she was killed, “three hours of togetherness, Noa was like a ray of light that came into my home. She was glowing and tanned, full of life and happy.”\n“Everyone who met Noa could talk to her for hours and hours,” said Toby. “She was a smart conversationalist, who always made you laugh, always with a smile.” She was supposed to complete her army duty in January, “and planned to take the world by storm, to travel to Paris with her friend, to go to shows, to spend time with friends. She knew the moment was approaching to chase after her dreams.”\n“Noa was smart, opinionated, brave, a hard worker, and would never avoid an argument over something that was important to her,” her brother, Ofir, told Kan public radio. “Everywhere she went she was a dominant and beloved figure.”\nOfir said that they both loved music and would argue over the years due to their very differing tastes. They finally agreed on a song they both loved, “Weird Fishes” by Radiohead, which Ofir dedicated to his sister. “Perhaps if we’d had more time we could have overcome our musical differences.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Lior Tarshansky, 15, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7.\nTerrorists tried to storm into the safe room where Lior was hiding out with his sister, Gali, and father, Ilya. They then lit the home on fire, and the Tarshanskys tried to jump out of the window, but terrorists were waiting and opened fire, killing Lior. Gali was taken captive to Gaza, while Ilya managed to escape. Gali was released from Hamas captivity on November 29.\nLior is survived by his mother, Reuma, father, Ilya, sister, Gali, grandparents Kamelia and Yehuda and many other family members. Lior’s uncle, Noy Shosh, was also murdered on October 7.\n“I haven’t succeeding in mourning Lior,” his mother, Reuma, told Channel 12 news on November 9. “I haven’t come to terms yet with that fact — that I have a daughter who is missing and another child who is gone… there are moments when I cry and break down but it’s not mourning.”\n“We’ve asked for forgiveness from Lior, that right now we’re focused on Gali,” she said, noting that for that reason they have not yet held a funeral. Reuma said that as they continued to attend marches and protests for the hostages, “We added him to our placards, he’s also part of the conversation, he’s with us. We’ll find time in the future to give him the time and the honor he deserves. Right now we’re not available for that.”\nHis grandmother, Kamelia, who also lives in Be’eri, told Ynet that on the morning of October 7, “I wrote to Lior and he told me that everything is OK, but I understood from his brief words that he was writing under great stress. He sent me a kiss, and I told him I loved him, and that was our last conversation.”\nKamelia told 103FM radio that “for two weeks we didn’t know where either of the children were, they were missing, about two weeks later they told us that Lior’s body had been found and he was killed, and later they told us Gali was kidnapped.”\nLior, a devoted fan of the Maccabi Haifa soccer team, was supposed to turn 16 on October 24. The team published a video that day paying tribute to Lior, featuring a balloon tied to an empty chair.\n“Today you should have been at the 16th birthday celebrations, and in this seat you were supposed to sit in the match against Hapoel Beer Sheva,” the team wrote. “Lior Tarshansky from Kibbutz Beeri, was murdered in the terror attack by Hamas in 7th October. Forever in our hearts.”\nHis aunt, Roxanne Saar, penned a tribute to him on Facebook.\n“Liori, the beloved child with the almond eyes. How can it be that I won’t see you again?” she wrote. “Your shy smile? The manly hottie you turned out to be? How can it be that you’ll never see the wins by Maccabi Haifa, who you loved so much?”\n“How can it be that you won’t laugh, be sad, travel, see and conquer the world, fall in love?” she wrote. “Liorki, I don’t know how to recover from such a horror… I’m sorry that I couldn’t save you my beloved child. I’m sorry we were helpless.”\nLior’s uncle, Gonen Saar, also paid tribute to him on social media.\n“When I think, I think about you, about what you will never become. And you, you could have become whatever you wanted, the king of the jungle or the king of the mountains — there was so much you could have been and won’t be, that my mind cannot handle the thoughts.”\nTime has stood still since October 7, Saar wrote, with all the weeks that have passed feeling like barely a minute.\n“And memory? Maybe in the future, who knows. When you don’t answer, don’t call, don’t come visit, when you’re missing in photos, at the game, in your chair,” he wrote. “When I stop looking for your lack of existence and get used to the loss, maybe then memory will come. In the meantime, I will close my eyes and hug you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Zohar tried to bring the kibbutz ambulance to evacuate Ido to a medical center but terrorists had shot the tires to prevent it from being used.\nNonetheless, he was able to bring Ido out of the area of an ongoing firefight and then did his best to save him.\n“I tried to do everything I could, everything that I know to save him,” Zohar told Kan.\nZohar was forced to alert the Magen David Adom dispatch center of the death of his own son.\nFor six hours, he sat by the body of Ido, holding his son’s hand, he told Kan.\n“I wanted to stay with him, a few more minutes,” Zohar recalled.\nNoa, unaware of the situation, continued sending Ido text messages asking him to send some sign that he was well.\nThe rest of Ido’s family had taken refuge together in a shelter at one of the kibbutz homes. It fell to Zohar to tell them that Ido had been killed.\nWhen he entered the home, grandson Guy, aged 4, asked him “Why have you come back and our father hasn’t?”\nIdo and Noa also have twin girls Gal and Goni aged 3.\nNearly six weeks after the attack, Noa told Kan that the twins are still asking “When is Abba coming back?”\n“He was an amazing father, and they feel that he is missing,” she said. “It breaks my heart each time I explain to them again that his absence will continue.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Later they moved to Kibbutz Erez near the Gaza border, before settling in Kibbutz Be’eri more than 30 years ago.\nTheir son, Omer, told the Makor Rishon newspaper that their father dreamed of being a car mechanic, and accomplished that goal in Be’eri, where he worked until his death. A memorial on the Kibbutz Be’eri website described him as “curious and inquisitive with many hobbies,” including collecting musical instruments despite the fact that he didn’t play any.\nYehudit, a retiree who used to work with kindergarten children and in the kibbutz dining room, was being treated with radiation for breast cancer when she was kidnapped.\n“Even in her retirement mom had a full diary,” said Omer. “She was first and foremost a full-time grandmother to her five grandchildren, had an open house for soldiers and kibbutz workers who didn’t live nearby, so they would have somewhere to eat Shabbat and holiday dinner. My parents always adopted soldiers and workers — people tell me all the time, ‘How did you end up with such a mother?'”\nA memorial on the Kibbutz Be’ri website described the couple as having “true love. In the evenings you could see them falling asleep on each other in front of the television. They loved spending time together, going on trips, seeing plays, hanging out with friends. Shmulik loved to treat her to jewelry that she loved.”\nThe couple were in touch with their five children — four of whom were also in Be’eri on October 7 — in the early hours of Saturday. But the last message was sent at 10:15 a.m., and then they stopped responding. One of their children later returned to the scene, where they believe they can tell that their father engaged in a firefight with a Hamas terrorist before he was killed, and his mother kidnapped.\nAfter news of Yehudit’s death was confirmed, her children spoke to the media, issuing a plea for the safety of the rest of the hostages.\n“It’s important for us to say that we fought, we battled in every possible way to bring mom, Grandma Yehudit home,” said her daughter-in-law Zemer. “For us, it is too late, but it is important for us to support all the families of the hostages, and to tell the world, bring them home now, so that for them it is not too late, like it was for us.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Saar Margolis, 37, was killed protecting his family and the community while fighting off terrorists in Kibbutz Kissufim on October 7.\nA member of the kibbutz’s local security team, he was recognized posthumously as a fallen soldier with the rank of sergeant major in the reserves. He is survived by his wife, Yasmin, their two daughters, Mia, 9, and Tavor, 7, as well as his parents, Selwyn and Vicky, and his siblings, Marcelle, Beora, Lance, Carmel, Barak, Hadassa and Stav.\nFamily and friends say he fought relentlessly for hours, with unwavering courage, saving many residents’ lives.\n“You did everything from your heart. You fought for your country, your family, and for all families in Kibbutz Kissufim until your last breath. I know you wouldn’t have wanted to go any other way,” said his sister Beora Margolis told the South African Jewish Report.\nAccording to reports, Margolis responded immediately when he heard suspicious sounds outside his home on the morning of October 7, when Hamas terrorists breached the border from Gaza and attacked the kibbutz and other southern communities. He later joined up with IDF forces, leading a small team with the 450th Battalion. He was killed, along with three soldiers, after coming under heavy gunfire.\nTo those who knew him, Margolis had a “big heart and a gorgeous smile and helped everybody.”\n“He was the life and soul of Kissufim. He held the kibbutz together. He was a leader, and we don’t know how the kibbutz will survive without him,” his sister added.\nThe son of a South African immigrant, Margolis grew up on Kissufim and lived there with his wife and two daughters. For 15 years, he served as head of the community’s security force before starting a job with the Defense Ministry. He was also a volunteer EMT with the Magen David Adom emergency medical service and was in the process of obtaining an ambulance driver’s license.\n“Saar never stopped wanting to help save lives,” said Yossi Abuharon, his manager at MDA. “He was so excited when he was sent as a first responder to calls in his area, and the desire to save lives burned within him. His death is a very great loss.”\nMDA director Eli Bin also paid tribute: “Magen David Adom cherishes and appreciates Saar’s service and shares in the family’s deep sorrow.”\nHis father, Selwyn, told Tablet that “I don’t know how I’ll get along without him. He was very special,” adding that they would meet up every day, “drinking beer and whiskey. We’d talk about life, plans, and politics.”\nHe continued: “If every father had a son like Saar, he would be proud. He was a very good son. If I needed anything, he would always be there for me. I would walk to him, and he would walk to me. I would cook for them.”\nA funeral ceremony for Margolis was held at the Beersheba Military Cemetery on October 15, but he was buried on Kibbutz Kissufim on October 18, with just a handful of people in attendance due to the security risks.\n“He was raised in the fields like all the children here, picking avocados and apples, and working on the farm among the cows and chickens,” his sister said. “The family insisted he be buried there, even if it meant the funeral took place during ongoing missile threats with only five people in attendance surrounded by heavy security. Kissufim was his life.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

We are broken and are working to cope with this unimaginable tragedy. We send our deepest thanks to those who made such an effort today to help find her and provide information and contacts.”\nBohl and Darlington were visiting Kibbutz Nir Oz when it was attacked by Hamas fighters in the early hours of October 7.\nDarlington posted dozens of Instagram stories during his travels with Bohl in the country. Many of his snapshots and videos captured a calm and peaceful Nir Oz – and a happy and smiling Bohl – just days before it became the sight of horrors and atrocities following Hamas’s massacre.\nBohl grew up in Hann. Münden, in Lower Saxony. She was living in Berlin, working as a model, and studying sustainable fashion at university. Her family said Bohl was a creative person who wanted to make the world a better place through art.\nBefore she was killed she had sent her mom in Germany a text message: “Thank you for all you did for me, I love you.”\nHer friend Eric Goetz wrote on Instagram that Carolin was “pure light, always and for everyone… The best and happiest soul I ever met. She always inspired to be happy, laugh and love.”\nOn what would have been her 23rd birthday, her friend Julien Stype wrote on Instagram: “I wish I could’ve celebrated your day with you in person. All of this seemed possible back then. I absolutely adore these film pictures of you, sitting at the window and enjoying the view of new york city. Today was a sunny day and wherever you might be, I hope you enjoyed your day to the fullest and may had a look down to us, just the way you did in these pictures – peaceful and full of joy.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

There they were killed in amid an intense firefight between Hamas and IDF troops. Only two survivors emerged from those held captive in the home.\nYannai and Aviya’s bodies were discovered in the weeks following the attack, and the pair were buried together on October 23 in Kibbutz Revivim. Ayala’s body was located weeks later, and the family decided to hold a funeral on November 15 for both Ayala and Liel, burying personal items belonging to Liel instead of waiting for her remains, since they believed she had no chance of still being alive.\nA few days after the funeral was held, some remains of Liel were also identified.\nAviya and his late wife, Eva — who died earlier this year — together with Ayala, raised the twins after their mother, Shira, suffered complications during their birth and was paralyzed.\nShira, who could not attend the funeral, sent words to be read by someone else at the ceremony: “Ayala, I was lucky that you were a role model to my children, and now you are together. You gave up so much without ever asking for anything in return.”\nOne mourner at the funeral said, “Ayala was an aunt in the job of mom, and Aviya was a grandfather and dad. Liel grew up surrounded by love. She was mature and childish, she was strong and tough, but she had her own fears she dealt with bravely and honestly.”\nThey said the twins had a close and special relationship with Ayala, and a unique bond with each other.\nOmri Shifroni, Ayala’s nephew, wrote on Facebook that his aunt was “pure, pleasant, beloved, like a second mother to me, and always accepted everyone and tolerated everything and was responsible for everyone… our beloved Ayalush, who raised with endless love two incredible twins who she got as a gift for her 60th birthday and were murdered with her just 12.5 years later.”\nLiel was eulogized at the funeral as “friendly and sensitive to all, both children and adults. Liel blossomed outside of the classroom. Her peers described her as a great girl who loved to go crazy with her friends — a troublemaker with a pure heart, a girl with a huge laugh.”\nAfter his death, Yannai’s teacher described him as “a leader among his peers and an amazing friend. He was funny and amicable, always ready to brighten the room with his humor and warmth.” Another said he “never failed to brighten every day with his infectious joy and laughter. He was a wonderful friend and also the class’s resident entertainer, spreading smiles to everyone around.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

They fled to a nearby bomb shelter and hid inside, thinking they were safe. Then came terrorists who fired at those hiding in the structure and threw grenades inside.\nDanielle was shot in the leg, she wrote recounting their ordeal, “I call out ‘Abba [Dad], Abba they shot me,’ when he didn’t respond I knew that they murdered my dad. I went silent. I was in no pain. I was numb to my core… we went to the party the seven of us, only three of us came back.”\nAvi’s niece, Lee Sasi, who spoke to CNN’s Jake Tapper about the horrifying ordeal, said they went to the party because their nephew and cousin, Omri Sasi, was DJing. Lee said that there were 35-40 people hiding out in the bomb shelter with them, and only nine emerged alive, as she watched people murdered right in front of her.\n“I had to witness firsthand my uncle getting blown [up] and exploded by a grenade that they threw onto his stomach,” she recounted.\nAvi, a native of Netanya, had been living in California, in the San Fernando Valley, for more than 30 years.

If only I could wake up from this nightmare and run into your arms.”\nHis niece, Gital Sasi, wrote on Instagram that she “wanted to thank you for all that you were for me and for my father. Thank you for loving my children like they were your own grandchildren. Thank you for being a guide, a listening ear, who always gave advice. You will always remain a huge part of us… you pushed us to dream big and to reach our goals. You always told me ‘Gita, the sky’s the limit, don’t be afraid.'”\nVideo shared by Danielle showed Avi dancing as the sun rose at the festival, just hours before he was murdered.\n“My Abba was one of a kind. He was real, and direct,” wrote Danielle on Instagram several weeks after his death. “His heart was the size of this universe. He gave and did for others without flaunting. You were lucky if you met him. My Abba, was [the epitome of] life in every aspect. He was loved by everybody.”\n“He was loud, strong, he had a heart of gold,” she added. “He loved every human — babies, kids, teens, young people, old people and all nationalities too… he loved flowers, music, and cologne. He loved to travel and see museums. He loved food, food was his symbol of love and how to be loved… he had the energy of a 20-year-old. He had style and swag.

    "story": "Izhar Peled, 61, Gila Peled, 59, and their son Daniel Peled, 28, were murdered together in their home in Kfar Aza on October 7.\nIzhar was a longtime police officer who retired in 2020 with the rank of assistant commissioner, after holding numerous senior positions in the Border Police, most recently as commander of its West Bank division. Gila was a nurse with the Clalit medical provider who worked in Ashkelon. Daniel was a paramedic who dreamed of studying medicine in the future.\nThey were survived by the three other siblings in the family, Yoni, Reut and Rotem, as well as several grandchildren/nieces and nephews.\nThe Clalit health service memorialized Gila as “an example and role model in her committment and devotion to the team working with her and to the patients, who greatly appreciated her.”\nThe Border Police said it will “forever remember [Izhar’s] enormous contribution to the security of the State of Israel and to strengthening the force of the corps,” recalling his tenure as one marked by “professionalism, long-term vision and a love of people and the country.”\nIn an interview with Israel Hayom, Border Police Commander Brick Yitzhak mourned the loss of Izhar: “When they told me he was missing, I imagined him in the dens of Gaza driving the terrorists crazy.” He was later informed of his death. “The eulogies at the funerals were tough, I had to stop and got choked up a few times,” he admitted.\nFriends and family of Daniel, who called him “Dandi,” all recalled his big love for gummy candies, and chose to memoralize him by asking people around the world to put out a bowl of gummy candy with a note about Daniel.\n“Daniel was a paramedic, a personal trainer, and the funniest and most charismatic person in the room,” they wrote on the Instagram account Dandi’s Candies. “Daniel would always joke that during his shiva [mourning period] he wanted to serve gummy candy and definitely not burekas or something else sad like that.”\nThey added that “this is how we’ve chosen to remember Daniel… who was sweet, colorful, happy and was good for the heart — just like gummy candy.”\nTheir sister and daughter-in-law Nitsan Peled wrote on Facebook a day after they were murdered memorializing “My dear father-in-law Izhar, a revered commander, a rare man of values, a Zionist. A much-loved father and grandfather. My mother-in-law Gila, and angel on earth, her whole purpose in this world was help and goodness. The glue of our home. Daniel, my brother-in-law Dandi, the unique, the funny, the spreader of light, who only started living.”\nReut Peled, Daniel’s sister and Izhar and Gila’s daughter, wrote on Facebook marking a month since the three of them were laid to rest side by side.\n“When will I understand, mom, that I won’t see your curls anymore, that I won’t feel them on my shoulder when we hug, that there is nobody to stroke my head on the couch when I’m a little sad,” she wrote. “And when will I understand, Dad, that nobody will give me kisses on the head anymore, just because, as they walk past me, on the way to the kitchen or to water the garden.”\n“And when will I understand, my little brother, that you didn’t just skip Friday night dinner again, that you’re not going to show up in the doorway by surprise,” she continued. “And when will I understand how it can be that you were born after me and left before me. When will I understand that we’re no longer four siblings, because mom always used to say that a stable table stands on four legs.”\n“And when will I understand how to part from half a family in one blow, when I haven’t really understood at all that you’re really no longer here.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Lavi Lipshitz, 20, a soldier in the Givati Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, was killed in the northern Gaza Strip on October 31 by a Hamas RPG missile.\nThe slain soldier, who had a lifelong passion for art and cinema, opened an Instagram account earlier this year under the name “Until When — A Photo Diary,” where he uploaded photos of his day-to-day life in the army.\nSince his death, Israelis have flocked to his Instagram page to post replies under his photos, turning his account into an online memorial.\n“Heartbroken, a hero of Israel,” wrote Israeli actor Michael Moshonov under Lipshitz’s most recent post. “Your art will sell in the millions.”\nThe photos, which he posted on an almost daily basis, captured the mundane aspects of his army service: soldiers resting on the bus, stops at gas stations and out-of-order urinals.\nLipshitz was an admirer of the director Wes Anderson and paid tribute to his cinematographic style with a video he shot during his army service. The video went viral after his death.\nLavi was born to Nitzan and Shlomit Lipshitz and grew up in Modi’in Maccabim-Re’ut. His high school studies were at the Israel Arts and Science Academy (IASA) where he majored in art.\nHe is survived by his parents, his older sister and two younger brothers.\nLipshitz’s funeral was held at Mount Herzl on November 1. At the end of her eulogy, Lavi’s older sister Anafa read from a letter that he left for her on a computer file, which he wrote in case something were to happen to him.\n“I ask you not to sink into grief. It may be daily and exhausting, but the action that can grow from it, it is not exhausting, but constructive. Nothing is more difficult for me than idleness, so I ask everyone around me — always be doing something.”\nLipshitz’s father, Nitzan, spoke about his son in a statement to the media: “He had a profound sensitivity. He was a very sensitive person, his dream was not to be a soldier, he wanted to be a photographer.”\nA collage of the work of Staff Sgt. Lavi Lipshitz, who fell in battle on October 31, 2023.

Zohar, 15, was next door with his mother, Sabine, after the couple had separated last year.\n“There were huge explosions and dad and I and Shay heard terrorists on the road behind us, and he told us to be quiet and not talk,” Koren recounted to the Kan public TV station. Gil grabbed his personal weapon and shot at the terrorists until he ran out of bullets, his son recalled.\nThen, the terrorists threw a grenade into the shelter they were hiding in: “There’s no way he wasn’t afraid but he decided to save us and he jumped on the grenade… there was an explosion, I saw smoke, suddenly we were covered in blood.”\nKoren said the terrorists came to check that Gil was actually dead, then drank the cola that was in the fridge and left the house. The two wounded brothers ran next door to their mother, where they hid in their safe room for hours until they were evacuated. Shay ultimately lost sight in one eye from shrapnel wounds.\nAfter several days, they were informed that Or had also been murdered on the Zikim beach. Father and son were buried side by side on October 18.\nSapir Taasa, Or’s cousin and Gil’s niece, wrote that a month after their funeral, “I’m still in a dream, then I wake up and enter a new unthinkable reality… the only comfort I have is that you died in the name of God, for the fact that you were Jews… if you only knew how much I miss you maybe you wouldn’t have left me.”\nSabine described Or, her firstborn, as “the light of my life, my ray of sunshine, who lit up my life.”\nShe said she promised Gil and Or “that I will keep building and rehabilitate my life in Netiv Ha’sara — they didn’t break me, the opposite. They strengthened me more than ever to sow my seeds and rebuild and restore our beautiful moshav.”\nZohar wrote on Facebook on the evening of October 7 to his father, saying that “by some miracle, I am still alive and I have the chance to tell you that I love you… you tried to save the lives of my brothers but it cost you your life. I love you so much and you will always be in my memories, I wish I could have told you this before, my life is nothing without you, and thank you for all the years, I’m lucky that I got to be a part of your life.You’re my hero, Dad.”\nTwo days later, Zohar wrote that Or’s body had been found as well.\n“God have mercy on me, what did I do to deserve all this?” he wrote. Or, “you had so many plans, you were so young and talented and all your life was ahead of you. I’m shattered to pieces, now I have to be the leader of the house.

With two friends he later went on to set up Firefly, a highly successful internet cloud management company.\nAfter sheltering from an initial rocket barrage from the Gaza Strip, Genis messaged his wife, Meital, to let her know he was fine. Together with Navon, he prepared to drive home.\nHowever, another rocket hit near their car and the two injured men were forced to again take cover in a public bomb shelter where there were already two women, Meital told Channel 12.\nHe continued sending messages to her and others, warning of the increasingly perilous situation as the rocket fire was replaced by the sounds of terrorists on foot shooting victims.\nThe last message he sent was “I love you” with a heart emoji, Meital recalled.\nThree weeks after the attack, one of the women who was hiding in the shelter, identified only as Alina, called Meital to explain what happened next, praising the pair of friends as “angels” who had saved her life.\nAlina said that as the four huddled in the shelter, they heard a terrorist approaching outside. She described the friends looking at each other in the eyes and then, without a word, together charging out to face the attacker, unarmed, in an effort to grab his gun. Both were killed in the attempt.\nAlina told Meital, “Thanks to the fact that they attacked the terrorist, they prevented him from entering the shelter and seeing that there were other people there.”\nHowever, more attackers came, throwing grenades into the shelter and shooting those inside.

His keenness to attend the party was an example of his “drive and passion for life” and his desire to “succeed and conquer the world,” she said.\n“And he did it,” Hadas added.\nIn a post to X (formerly Twitter), the Firefly company wrote, “Our Firefly family is heartbroken over the loss of our co-founder, Sefi Genis.

His father Rafi described how his son was part of a team that operated observation balloons that floated over the Gaza border and he had only been moved to Nahal Oz two months before the attack.\nIn an interview on Channel 14, Rafi described how his son went through combat training as a fighter and that he and the other four balloon operators put up a heroic fight when the base was overrun by Hamas gunmen who far outnumbered them.\nRafi told the interviewer that before the army told him what happened during the battle for the Nahal Oz base, when people asked him how he’s doing he would stare off at the wall and not know what to say.\nNow, knowing that his son died heroically trying to fight an invading force against all odds, he knows what to say.\n“Now I say, I’m a proud father of a fighter who died in order that all of us can leave here in peace and security.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Dr. Daniel Levi (Ludmir), a native of Peru and a physician at the Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, was murdered by Hamas terrorists while he was trying to treat the wounded in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7.\nHe is survived by his wife, Lihi, and their two young children, Emma, 4 and Liam, almost 2. His parents and siblings came from South America to Israel for the funeral, held on October 15.\n“I don’t say this out loud, but I need to ask God why — why was this good man murdered?” his brother, Michael Levi, was quoted as saying by the Los Angeles Times at his funeral.\nLihi told the Mako news site that the family went into their bomb shelter when the sirens began ringing in the kibbutz early Saturday morning. Then Daniel was called to the local clinic in the community to help treat the many people wounded in the Hamas onslaught on the kibbutz.\n“He gave me a kiss and he left,” she said. “If only I had known that it was our last moment.”\nHe updated her throughout the day that they were running out of supplies, and they were afraid of the terrorists still roaming the kibbutz. She believes he was later killed when Hamas terrorists threw a grenade into the clinic where he was treating wounded civilians.\n“He was the love of my life, we had a deep and strong relationship, a connection that I never thought I would have with anyone,” she said. His death, she said, “is a loss to humanity. I’m not just saying that because I’m his wife… he was a prodigy in his work” as an ear, nose and throat physician. “He was an exceptional person in every field, unimaginably smart, good-hearted, the best friend, always the first to help — even at his own expense.”\nLevi’s brother-in-law, Adam Danieli, eulogized him in a lengthy Facebook post, recalling him joining the family “with a smile from ear to ear, blue eyes that look deep into the soul, contagious laughter that infects everyone, a sharp mind and an ability to process data that makes NASA’s computers jealous.”\n“Daniel, I will start speaking about you in the past tense because otherwise, people will think I’m completely crazy,” wrote Danieli, “but we both know that your soul is alive and kicking and watching over all the people you loved.”\nProf. Daniel Kaplan, chief of the ENT department at Soroka where Levi worked, said he “immediately won our hearts with his dedication and his quick ability to learn. He also had special people skills. He was a skilled resident, with a lot of knowledge and a strong ambition to learn and advance. He always kept calm and had good energy, I never heard him complain or anyone complain about him.”\nKaplan said that a member of the Be’eri local security force who was treated by Levi in his final hours alive “told me about his bravery in the fact of the terrorists and the care he gave to the wounded. He noted his kind eyes, his calm demeanor that was so like him.”\nLihi said that Levi always knew he would become a doctor, “but at the moment of truth when he ran to save lives, there was nobody to save him.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

They’re known for attending such types of parties and gatherings in their recognizable blue shirts, which read “Good Guy,” to provide services to anyone experiencing distress, which can be common at raves where drug use is widespread.\nThere were nine Elem volunteers at the Supernova music festival near Re’im on the morning of October 7. Only six made it out alive.\nAlongside Atias, volunteers Yonatan Richter and Sigal Levi were also murdered. Atias’s body was only recovered eight days after the massacre, and she was buried on October 16.\nShe is survived by her husband, Guy, and 6-year-old daughter, Alma, as well as her parents, Tikva and Yigal, and siblings Mor and Dudi. Friends and family remembered her as a huge animal lover, with a winning smile and a larger-than-life personality.\nAtias taught for a while in a Rehovot school before leaving to retrain as a veterinary nurse, working at a practice in the city.\nMaayan Shenker Brownstein, a fellow Elem volunteer, recounted to the Kan public news station that as they tried to flee volleys of bullets at the festival, she saw Atias wounded: “I picked her up and I tried to see if she was conscious but she wasn’t. And they were still shooting at us, so I kept going. I kept running.”\nIn a statement, the Elem organization recalled Atias as someone with “a huge joy for life, who spread light and love to anyone she encountered. She always made sure to be there for everyone — young and old, and always with her characteristic smile… Lior, a good and dear woman, I’m sorry you left us when all you wanted was to do good.”\nMor Hadad, Lior’s sister, said “she really loved” her volunteer work with the group. “She got so excited for every event you attended,” she told the surviving volunteers in a Kan news item. “It was so fitting for her. When she told me that she was doing it, I was so proud of her… I said ‘it’s so like you, to both help people and also enjoy a party.'”\nAt her funeral, her husband pointed out that Lior’s name — which means “my light” in Hebrew — was perfectly fitting to her personality.\n“Lior brought light into every room she entered,” said Atias. “It sounds like the kind of thing you say in a eulogy, but everyone here who knew her, knew well that it was true.”\n“Everyone fell in love with her in a second,” he added. “There are so many people here whose lives she only touched for a moment, and they won’t forget her their entire lives.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

A loving and caring grandmother, who knew what every grandchild liked and in her freezer was ice cream according to every one’s preference.”\nAyelet noted that her oldest granddaughter, Omer, is slated to give birth next year “and provide her with her first great grandchildren, and Bilha was so excited. She will no longer get to meet him.”\nA photography school in Tel Aviv said that Epstein was part of their online community and taken part in their courses over the course of a decade.\n“Almost everything Bilha photographed — people and places — she photographed in the kibbutz she loves so much,” the school wrote. “Bilha looked again and again at her world with love, curiosity, and found within it beauty and compassion everytime. Bilha, we already miss you, your childlike curiosity, your honesty, your self humor, the kind look in your eyes.”\nBilha’s son-in-law, Ron Mandelbaum, recalled her as “a woman of action and spirit, a unique mother and grandmother.”\nVivi Ziv, the wife of Bilha’s cousin Yossi Ziv, remembered Bilha in a Facebook post.\n“What a privilege it was to be part of your family,” she wrote. “I miss your smile and your wonderfully kind eyes.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

The two sought shelter near his home, but soon realized that the rockets were hardly the only threat.\nRozolio recounted to Channel 13 News Chana’s heroic actions that morning, after they began to hear nearby gunshots while hiding out from the rockets fired from Gaza.\n“Everyone started to panic and hide and Israel and I were standing on the street and suddenly we saw [the terrorists],” she recalled. “Israel didn’t think twice, he went to go get his personal weapon… and went with another 15 or so civilians and started to search for the terrorists.”\nRozolio said he left the house in flip flops and with just 15 bullets in his pistol against heavily armed swarms of terrorists.\nShe never heard from him again. A day later, she said, she felt she needed to search for answers, leaving her house to try and find a trace of him. “I saw his flip-flop lying in a pool of blood, and I understood that something not good happened.”\nA neighbor came out to tell them that she had seen his body and covered it up with a blanket, but they did not want to believe her. Five days later, the official word came down that his body had been identified and his death confirmed.\nRozolio said that the neighbor later told them that she saw Chana “alone against a cell of terrorists” and that he was running and hiding and shooting at them, “getting their focus on him so that they wouldn’t infiltrate into houses… he killed one terrorist and he seriously wounded another,” stopping them from entering nearby homes.\nShe said that people came to the shiva mourning period and told her and his family that “if he wasn’t there, things would look very different in Ofakim, he really saved a whole neighborhood.”\nAt a memorial marking 30 days since his death, his mother, Yishi Chana, told the Davar newspaper that her sense of loss was enormous.\n“Israel was my second son and the pillar of our home,” she said, adding “I have no words” repeatedly. “It’s very hard. I don’t know how I can go to sleep, how I can wake up in the morning, how to live. But I have to, I have three other children.”\nChana, of Ethiopian descent, was among the activists calling to bring back Avera Mengistu, the Israeli-Ethiopian citizen who has been held captive in Gaza since 2014.\nHis friend, Solomon Samay, wrote on Facebook that they were fighting to have his story of bravery told across the country.\n“Israel, I miss our conversations, we had deep talks about life, family, children and home,” wrote Samay. “And we also had nonsense conversations where we would laugh and every dumb joke. I miss your contagious laughter, your characteristic smile and our meetings where we would just sit and spend time together. Israel, my dear brother, I miss you so much and I don’t know how to accept this, you were like a little brother to me.”\nRozolio told Channel 12 that Israel “would always help others with all his heart, would bring joy and light to every place he went. He brought me so much joy in life. We were talking about getting married, starting a family. He was the man of my life. He always put himself last.”\nIsrael’s brother, Avraham Chana, shared a photo of the balloons that were waiting for Israel at home for his birthday.\n“I am struggling to find the worlds,” he wrote. “October 7 is not just a date it’s your birthday and we brought you presents and got you a cake… my hero, watch over us from above, I love you my brother.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Rose Lubin, 21, a Border Police officer in Jerusalem’s Old City precinct, was killed in a stabbing attack in the capital on November 6.\nLubin, a native of Atlanta, Georgia, moved to Israel as a lone soldier to enlist in the IDF, and was drafted to serve in the Border Police. She would often stay with her “adopted family” in Kibbutz Sa’ad, near the Gaza Strip, and was there on Simhat Torah when Hamas carried on its murderous onslaught on southern Israel.\nAt Lubin’s funeral, a resident of Sa’ad recalled that Lubin picked up her weapon and joined the battle against Hamas terrorists trying to break into the kibbutz: “I asked her to put on her uniform so she could be identified as part of the team,” he said, adding that she fought throughout that day until she was called back to Jerusalem and her duties with the Border Police. The terrorists were successfully prevented from breaking into the kibbutz.\nLubin is survived by her parents, Robin and David, brothers Alec, Joseph and Isaac, sister, Lily, as well as grandparents and step-grandparents. At her funeral, Lubin was recalled as a wonderful big sister to her younger siblings, a colorful, wise soul who was a staunch vegan, fierce wrestler, joyful cheerleader at Dunwoody High School and longtime Zionist.\n“Rose is the most free-spirited person I know,” said her brother Alec, describing a young woman who always dyed her hair different colors as an “extension of who she is.”\nAlec was often Rose’s sparring partner for wrestling practice, and she was a “tough as nails, short, stubby, muscular girl” who moved from wrestling to cheerleading in high school and later found her place in Israel’s Border Police. He spoke of “noodling” for catfish together in the Kentucky River, of catching fireflies, of his sister’s love for horses.\nHer mother, Robin Lubin, thanked God for choosing her to be Rose’s mother. She read from Rose’s bat mitzvah speech, in which her daughter declared her desire to “create a mind-blowing life story.”\n“‘There will be a time that I will not be existent in this world,’” she read. “‘So what do I do? I will do something great for the world, I won’t wait for the world to do something great for me.’”\nTamar James, Lubin’s “adopted mother” from Kibbutz Sa’ad, said she was wearing a bright pink shirt in Lubin’s honor. “You were so colorful and full of life, like a people magnet,” said James. “You joined our family and our kids saw you as the big sister.”\nRose’s father, David Lubin, spoke about his daughter’s first trips to Israel, her committed Jewish family in Atlanta and her decision at a young age to move to Israel and join the army.\nHis daughter was an individual who “made fashion trends her own,” never wearing matching socks, and with hair that “has been every length and shape, including shaved,” he said.\nHe recalled how determined Rose was to fulfill her dream of moving to Israel and joining the army, even from a very young age.\n“She would tell kids in the playground that they could be friends now — but that she was joining the IDF at 18,” he recounted.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Noa was slated to start a master’s degree program this fall and Gidi was the founder of “Radio Berlin,” which organized parties and raves in Tel Aviv with international DJs.\nTheir aunt, Tzviya Chiell, told Ynet news that “despite their age gap they were very close to each other. They both loved music festivals and went down there with friends to the party.”\nTzivya said the murders of Noa and Gideon “have left the family destroyed.” She noted that both of the siblings had a tattoo in Hebrew that read, “There’s no such thing as impossible,” something that was written on the gravestone of their grandfather.\nSeveral members of the family have since gotten the same tattoo on their arm to memorialize the slain siblings.\nThat sentence, she said, has become like a last will and testament for the family: “We will break and we will rise again, break and rise again, until we rise, because there is no such thing as impossible.”\nGideon’s girlfriend, Alina Vorko, wrote on Instagram about how they recently moved in together but would never get to experience so many things together.\n“We never got to slouch on the sofa and watch a movie. We never got to prepare a normal dinner together, to listen to music, to dance and be happy, just you and me,” she wrote. “We worked so hard on our home together, but we never got to start our lives together like we wanted and planned.”\n“You taught me how to live, what it is to really live, I changed so much thanks to you, you made me a better person from day to day,” Vorko added. “I couldn’t have asked for a more perfect person than you. You are the first and forever love of my life, true unconditional love with no boundary — the universe gave me too good of a gift, and took it away too quickly.”\nNoa’s roommate, Lior Shemesh, eulogized her on social media, writing, “My Noa, my sister, who always stood by me, was first to arrive when I needed her, whether my heart was broken or if I just didn’t want to drive to work alone.”\n“My Noa, a role model, keeper of secrets, partner in nonsense, in dancing, a true unconditional friend… I love you my Noa, I will miss you forever.”\nTheir younger brother, Harel, wrote on Instagram about his relationship with each of his slain siblings.\n“My Noa’le… I miss your voice so much, I keep asking myself where you are so that you’ll come and annoy me like you loved so much… come and embarrass me like always,” he wrote.\n“You don’t understand how much I miss you and Gidi. I feel empty, lacking, it’s so hard,” wrote Harel. “Please come and annoy me, even just a little, even just one more time.”\nTo Gidi, Harel wrote, “Since I was a kid you accompanied me and taught me everything, there are not a lot of big brothers like that… I miss our conversations where we would sit at the coffee bar on the balcony or just on the phone and you would tell me about your dreams, and ask me how I was.”\n“I was so proud of you and would say everywhere I went how much of a champion you were, everyone I met I would ask them if they knew ‘Radio Berlin,'” Harel recalled. “You’re my role model and always will be, and I admire you on levels I don’t think anyone will understand.”\n“The amount of things you accomplished was unbelievable, to you sleep was just a recommendation,” Harel added. “You proved to the world that ‘there is no such thing as impossible’… whenever things are hard I tell myself that Gidi would never give up, and would prove to everyone that ‘there is no such thing as impossible.'”\nRead more Those We Have Lost articles here."

Who would have known that you would lose your life there suddenly at such a young age.”\nDor’s younger brother, Ron, wrote on Facebook about the special bond the pair shared.\n“I don’t know how to part from you, it’s so hard, but for you, I will always stay strong and happy,” Ron wrote. “You were the best big brother I could ever ask for, you were always there to me, for every single thing, and you were my best friend who I could tell everything to.”\n“I want to thank you for all that you taught me, when I was born you protected me, educated me, brought me up, I couldn’t ask for it to happen any other way and I love you and won’t stop missing you.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Avraham “Avi” Hatuel, 52, was slain by Hamas terrorists in his home in Ofakim on October 7.\nHearing the approaching sound of gunshots, Hatuel stood up and prepared to exit the reinforced room of his home.\nHe tried to calm his wife and three children, who had huddled in that space with him after rockets from Gaza started raining down on their city on October 7, by saying that “it may be just kids setting off some firecrackers,” his wife, Shoshi, told The Times of Israel. “I’m going outside to see what’s going on,” he said.\nThese were his last words. One of the dozen-odd terrorists who on October 7 raided Ofakim, going house to house in search of civilians to murder, gunned Hatuel down in the entrance to his house. But then the terrorists moved on, possibly because they believed they’d killed everyone at the Hatuels’ address.\n“He sacrificed his life to save ours,” Shoshi said about her late husband, who was 52 when he was murdered and had worked at the Electra energy and engineering firm.\nHatuel was a devoted father and husband and his 25-year-long marriage to Shoshi was close and loving, Shoshi said. “He was just a perfect person. I miss him terribly,” she said at a hotel in Eilat, where she is staying as part of a government-sponsored rehabilitation program for the traumatized victims of the October 7 onslaught.\nShoshi heard the shot that killed her husband. She rushed to him but he was no longer conscious. She saw a small pool of blood starting to form under him and understood that his wound was life-threatening. She called emergency services repeatedly but soon realized the city was cut off as security services scrambled to clear the houses and streets from the armed terrorists.\n“I went back inside the safe room and hid there. Occasionally I went to check on Avi and each time I saw the pool of blood grow until I understood he was going to die,” she recalled. She told her children that their father had lost a lot of blood and might not make it. Her youngest, Yagel, assured his sisters that their father would get a blood transfusion and “it will all be fine,” Shoshi recalled. Instead of responding to Yagel, Shoshi hugged her children and began sobbing.\nThe terrorist who murdered Hatuel holed up with four others at the home of David and Rachel Ederi, which is situated across from the Hatuel residence. Police killed all five terrorists there in a rescue operation from which both hostages emerged unscathed.\nAvi and Shoshi Hatuel used to vacation in Eilat annually and the stay in that city brings back painful memories, Shoshi said. She still refers to him in the present tense. Twice since arriving at the Club Med hotel in Eilat, she told to her children to ask their father to give them a ride somewhere in town — before she remembered seeing him die.\n“Avi wasn’t a soldier and he wasn’t a police officer, but he was a husband and father who, when danger happened, went to stop it with his body,” Shoshi said. “By doing that, he saved his entire family.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Family members said that the terrorists then burned her house down, and her remains were only formally identified and buried a full month later, on November 6.\nHer family said Bracha — who was the daughter of Holocaust survivors — moved to Israel as a young woman, ultimately raising her two daughters as a single mother on the kibbutz, where she was known for always riding her bike around and tending to her garden. She is survived by two children, Shay and Shahar, and eight grandchildren.\nShay Shimoni, Bracha’s daughter, said that she was “devastated, I was shocked, I couldn’t comprehend the situation, it was too big to understand,” she told Sky News. “It took me many days and weeks to go to the point that I understand she’s gone, she will not come back, and I need now to try to build my life without her.”\nHer granddaughter, Hagar Shimoni, told the TV network that her grandmother “was so full of love, hugging and kissing us all the time, just laughing with us.”\nShay told i24 News that her mother “loved the community, loved the outdoors, loved her small garden that she nurtured, she was full of life.

Aviad Rivlin, 23, who grew up in the Haredi town of Tifrah in the south, were murdered by Hamas terrorists at the rave. Aviad was an off-duty soldier in the Technological and Logistics Directorate, who attended the party while on weekend leave.\nYohai and Yinon Rivlin, who were also in attendance at the party, managed to escape alive. The brothers all grew up in a large Haredi family, with 12 siblings in all, and several of them later chose to lead secular lives, while others stayed in the Orthodox community. The family recently moved to the religious Otniel settlement.\nYossi Rivlin, their oldest brother, told a Kan podcast that the brothers ended up being split up when Hamas terrorists stormed the festival. Gideon called Yohai and told him he had been shot three times, and Yohai stayed on the line with him as he hid in a separate location until he took his last breath, Yossi recounted.\nGigi was “a noble person, just such a good kid,” said Yossi, noting that his brother was about to enlist in the IDF. He was named after his uncle, also Gideon Rivlin, who lived in Gush Katif in Gaza before the disengagement, and was killed in 2005 when the jeep he was in drove over a roadside bomb planted by terrorists.\nNeomi Rivlin, a sister to Gideon and Aviad, shared the eulogies she read for her brothers on Facebook:\n“Gigi, my beloved brother, you always had a smile on your face — even when you were angry you had a sort of smile that quickly turned into contagious laughter,” she wrote. “You radiated light and love. Your soul always sought out freedom, love… my little brother, a wonder child, who left even before we got to deeply know each other, to experience so many more things together.”\nAbout Aviad, she wrote: “My big brother, my Aviadi, how can I part from you? How can I no longer hear your laugh, how can I no longer see you every Friday in a video chat before Shabbat?” she said. “You were the pillar of strength of our family. You always knew how to make us happy, to unite us, to make mom happy, to sit with a beer with dad, to make us all laugh, to make sure we always celebrated birthdays… to make all of us feel like we were the most important thing in the world to you.”\nYossi told Kan that Aviad “was the heart of our home… I’m the oldest but he was the heart. He was always a great listener to anyone who wanted to seek his advice, to our parents as well.” Yossi described his brother as “a genius,” who despite only receiving a yeshiva education taught himself English, completed his high school matriculation independently and aced the necessary math requirements for enlisting in the Technological and Logistics Directorate.\nDaniel Barak described his friend Aviad as a “pure boy with a genius brain who just wanted to do good and enjoy life as much as possible — you always had a positive approach to everything, even when things were difficult.”\nIn a video from his unit ahead during a Rosh Hashana toast, just weeks before he was murdered, Aviad wished that all his comrades “in their own way will succeed in accomplishing their dreams and aspirations, while simultaneously giving as much as possible to [the IDF] system.”\nYohai Rivlin, who emerged alive from the party, wrote on Facebook: “Aviad and Gigi, aside from being my brothers you were such a huge part of my life, we did everything together. We lived together, we traveled togther, we worked together, we laughed, we went to parties, you always made sure that all of our friends were having fun and happy.”\nYohai added that his two brothers “will always remain etched on to my heart.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Vitaly worked most recently in agriculture on the kibbutz, and also loved to feed the stray cats around the neighborhood.\nAt Vitaly’s funeral, their friend and neighbor, Asif Goren, said the Troufanov family “was adopted by the local residents” when they arrived as immigrants, according to comments printed in Ma’ariv.

You are my best friend who I can run to and talk to without an introduction… language or country was not a barrier… you have been my best friend since I came to Kibutz Be’eri… I will never forget you… thank you for everything, for loving me, For all the support and everything.”\nIn the Facebook post, Anula can be seen in photos hanging out with friends at a branch of the “Golda” ice cream chain in Israel, and in what appears to be the very familiar surroundings of a kibbutz assembly hall.\nThe news site BNN Breaking wrote that Anula was a resident of the town of Eriyawetiya “whose hopes for a better life were tragically cut short miles away from home on foreign soil.”\nThe article referred to Anula as an “island daughter in the heart of the conflict.” It stated that Anula was “not merely a statistic” in the bloodshed of an intractable conflict, but rather, “she was a 49-year-old mother of two who worked tirelessly for a decade in Israel, far from the familiar landscapes of her hometown, Eriyawetiya.”\nThe article added, “in the grand scheme of war, Ratnayake may represent a single life lost, but she also stands as a poignant emblem of the cost of conflict.”\nOn October 25, a memorial was held in Petach Tikva for Anula. Friends and loved ones — Israelis, Sri Lankans and others from points beyond — came to pay their respects.\nIn a Facebook post, Israeli Efrat Vaknin spoke of her love for Anula, who took care of her late mother-in-law Aliza before her death a few years ago. Efrat wrote that even after Aliza died they would drive down to Be’eri to visit Anula and Etti, the elderly woman she took care of. Efrat wrote that Anula is the one who set up the WhatsApp group “Family” and that “we were a family in every way.”\nEfrat wrote of a woman who loved people and life and always put others before herself. She also wrote that she misses the messages from Anula on Fridays wishing her “Shabbat Shalom” and the sweetness she spread to all who crossed her path.\n“We can’t send you pictures and videos of [Efrat’s child] Cleo, and you won’t send me pictures of your trips around the kibbutz and kibbutz events, and we won’t be able to drink your tea or the delicious cookies you made. We can’t hug you anymore… Anula, we miss you so much.”\nYael Gilboa, Aliza’s niece, also eulogized Anula as “devoted and with a heart of gold, she also took care of the cats in the yard, and probably also birds and other creatures… We grieve with Anula’s family and friends and send them our condolences. She will not be forgotten.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Varda Harmati, 81, was killed in her home on Kibbutz Re’im, near the Gaza border, on October 7.\nShe was found in her bed with a gunshot wound to the head by her partner of over 50 years, Boaz, who lived elsewhere on the kibbutz.\n“The queen is dead,” he texted (Hebrew link) her family, who had been frantically trying to reach her for hours that devastating Saturday morning on October 7. She would always send a good morning message with flower emojis in the family chat. That morning, those messages never came.\nBoaz stayed with Varda’s body for approximately 30 hours until forces arrived.\nA child of Holocaust survivors, Harmati was born in pre-state Israel in 1942 on Kibbutz Maoz Haim in the Beit She’an Valley. She served in the since-disbanded Sayeret Shaked special forces unit (1955-1979), part of the Israel Defense Forces Southern Command, which was tasked with thwarting infiltrators and traffickers from the then Egyptian-controlled Gaza Strip on Israel’s southern borders.\nShe fell in love with the south during her service, according to her family.\nHarmati was among the founders of Kibbutz Re’im, where she raised two children and saw her grandchildren grow up. Recently, a great-grandchild was born to granddaughter, Noa Harmati, and Varda was excited for an upcoming visit set for the weekend after October 7.\n“You waited for your great-granddaughter Niv to come to the kibbutz and to show her to all the friends. I promise you that we will give Niv the tour you so wanted to give,” Noa Harmati, 26, said of her grandmother.\nStill rocking red hair and crimson lipstick at 81, Harmati was a fixture of the kibbutz and somewhat of a local celebrity. She still worked in the kibbutz factory for laser-based engineering company Isralaser.\nShe was “a woman who everyone on the kibbutz loved, it was impossible not to,” said (Hebrew link) her grandson Itamar Mizrachi, the son of her daughter Ayelet Harmati.\n“A woman so sociable and full of life that the friends in the kibbutz were like her sisters. She is a woman full of values, a true pioneer who instilled in us the love of the place. She never left it in any war, and indeed my mother stayed in the kibbutz and raised a family there, and I also returned to stay,” Mizrachi said.\nMizrachi, 24, returned to Kibbutz Re’im after six years away studying fashion design.\n“We did everything together,” he said. “I had no doubt that I had one home to which I wanted to return. Grandma and I were best friends. I was close to her, talking to her about everything and visiting her every day.”\nMizrachi survived the killings, first by hiding in his apartment’s safe room and then communicating with the kibbutz’s civil defense team which instructed him on safer hiding areas.\nHe soon learned of his grandmother’s death. He and others with him “didn’t allow ourselves to cry so that they wouldn’t hear us.”\nWith tears in his eyes, he described to Maariv that his grandmother was like “a movie star because that’s what she looked like and that’s what she transmitted.\n“Sweet, loving, compassionate, a soulmate, a loving person and a loving grandmother to her grandchildren and great-granddaughter. If you met [her]… a ruby red mark would remain on your cheek for the whole day,” he said.\n“A woman who is a fighter, who loved life and the country and traveled almost all over the world. Worked until her last day at the kibbutz factory. Every morning she would ride her bike, work, visit friends, go shopping in Netivot, go to plays and the cinema. A larger-than-life woman,” Mizrachi went on.\nNoa Harmati said goodbye to her with these words: “My beloved grandmother, I always thought you would live forever. Getting up in the morning for work, walking around the kibbutz, it really seemed like your whole life was still ahead of you. The kibbutz was your pride, you would walk in it like a queen. My heart is broken, grandma. I’m sorry your life ended this way, grandma.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "When young Israeli Irene Shavit spoke to her mother after her first date with Netta Epstein, she said she was “already in love” but feared it could “end badly.” Shavit, 22, had imagined that the romance, like so many others, might end in heartbreak.\nInstead, it ended on October 7, when Epstein dived onto a Hamas grenade to save her life. He was among the 1,400 people, mostly civilians, killed in the Hamas massacre.\n“He died so I could live, so I must live,” said Shavit about her fiancé, who was also 22.\nBut starting life again poses a wrenching dilemma for her.\n“If I don’t do it, it’s a betrayal. But if I do it, I also feel like I’m betraying him,” she said, crying. “I miss his kisses, his embrace, his love.”\nThe pair had been due to marry in April and Shavit had already bought the wedding dress. She was speaking as Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza rages on, now staying at her parents’ home in the town of Bitzaron south of Tel Aviv.\nShavit Irene, girlfriend of 22-year-old Israeli citizen Netta Epstein who died when he jumped on a grenade during the October 7 massacre in southern Israel gives an interview at her house in the village of Bitzaron near the city of Ashdod on November 3, 2023. (Gil COHEN-MAGEN/AFP)\nShavit and Epstein met at a bar in April 2022 and shared an “immediate attraction,” she remembered.\nThey finished their mandatory army service — she in military intelligence, he as a parachute regiment officer — before moving in together in Kibbutz Kfar Aza.\nFrom the edge of the commune, described by Shavit as a “paradise of trees and flowers,” they could see the buildings of Gaza City, the biggest urban center in the blockaded coastal enclave.\nOn Saturday, October 7, the younger residents of the kibbutz were planning a group breakfast before a kite festival with a political take on the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n“We wanted to fly them with messages of peace towards the Gaza border,” Shavit said.\nBut at 6:30 a.m. they were awoken by the words “red alert” blaring over the kibbutz loudspeakers. The alarm was routine in the border town, which has often been targeted by rocket fire from the Palestinian territory.\nThe couple took a selfie and sent it to their families to reassure them. Then they went back to sleep in each other’s arms, thinking they were safe in a bedroom nested in a missile-proof cocoon.\nBut at 8:00 a.m. they received a mass text message: “Enter lockdown, suspicion of infiltration, hide.”\nThe message sent a shockwave of fear through the kibbutz, where everyone was used to leaving their doors unlocked. They turned off the light and stayed still.\nThe first shots sounded “in the distance” and quickly the news of the first victims arrived via a text message. First Epstein’s grandmother was killed and then a cousin.\nIn the darkness of the shelter, the couple muffled their sobs, holding tight to their phones, their only means of contact with the world outside.\nShavit recalled the terror and uncertainty they felt at the time: “No one understands what is going on outside. The shots are getting closer.”\nAt 11:30 a.m. they heard glass break in the living room. The couple pressed their backs up against the bedroom wall, hoping not to be seen. Shavit remembered the “indescribable fear.” Their bedroom door opened and, as Shavit recoiled, Epstein stepped forward.\nTwo grenades were tossed and a Hamas militant shouted in Hebrew “Leave! Where are you?”\nAs a third grenade was thrown into the room, Shavit saw her fiancé throw himself on it.\n“It’s what he learned in the army,” she said. “If there’s a grenade in an enclosed space you jump on it to protect others.”\nAfter the blast, the gunman fired a burst of bullets to finish Epstein off, before setting the room on fire and leaving.\nShavit, resigned to death, pulled her pajamas over her mouth to block out the fumes. But when she heard the attackers withdraw, she crept out to the bathroom and put out the fire. She then slid under the bed, hidden by a backpack and Netta’s body.\nAt 4:00 p.m., Shavit heard Israeli troops shouting in Hebrew if there were any survivors. She hesitated before answering. When she did, the soldiers extracted her while a battle to retake the kibbutz still raged.\nShavit is left with “lots of what-ifs, lots of guilt, and lots of solitude,” she said.\nAt Epstein’s funeral there were “thousands” paying homage, she said.\nBut Shavit has few memories of the day of the burial. She was grieving a lifetime of companionship lost.\n“I told myself, what am I doing here?” she said. “Wasn’t this supposed to happen 70 years from now?”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Gaya Halifa was a month shy of her 25th birthday when she was killed trying to escape the Hamas massacre at the Supernova music festival at Kibbutz Re’im on October 7, 2023.\nHer father, Avi, was on the phone with her and believes he heard her last breaths when she and a group of friends came under gunfire as they attempted to flee the area in a vehicle.\nThe moment was captured on the car’s dashcam as terrorists opened fire at the vehicle, peppering the windshield with bullets. In the footage, the car slows and crashes into another vehicle on the side of the road.\n“Then there were two deep breaths, as if she had no oxygen, as if she couldn’t breath, and then a deep, deep silence,” Avi Halifa recounted to the Kan public broadcaster.\nGaya had been in constant touch with her parents that devastating Saturday morning, reassuring them that she was ok when rockets and interceptions started flying overhead. Then she said, “Dad there are gunshots here,” Avi recalled.\nHer family was not yet worried. Gaya had served as a combat medic in the Israel Defense Forces’ Duvdevan unit and didn’t lose her cool easily, they said.\nShe hid and updated her family. She even called her mom, Sigal, asking her to tell her brother, Ido, to stop calling her and to reassure him that she was ok.\nBut she was texting her dad, telling him that they were being fired upon and asking if the police had somehow given instructions on how to escape. “I didn’t know what to tell her, no one knew anything yet,” he said.\nShe and a few others, including her friend Romi Gonen, who is missing and presumed captive, stayed hidden and waited.\nGaya then contacted Ben Shimoni, another Supernova partygoer whose story of heroism circulated widely in the Hebrew-language media. Shimoni initially made it to safety, saving frantic strangers from terrorists at the music festival by loading them up in his car and driving away. He made multiple such trips, according to witness accounts.\nGaya’s father said that in her text conversation with Shimoni, she told him not to drive back to the party, that it was too dangerous. But he made it back and picked up Gaya, Romi, and a third passenger, Ofir Tzarfati, also presumed captive.\nGaya sent her dad a text saying, “Ben the hero came to get us, he’s driving around” trying to find a way out, and asked him to meet her in Ashdod.\nWhen Avi and Sigal left for Ashdod, it was with a feeling of relief that Gaya had been saved and that she would be home soon.\nHe thought the next call from Gaya would be with a meet-up location. But the call was of sounds of terror and gunfire.\n“Dad, they’re shooting at us!” he said she was yelling, adding that he didn’t have time to say hello and “it was over, in five or six seconds. You don’t realize that it’s the end.”\nHer parents drove to all the hospitals, holding onto hope. Everyone knew but there was silence at home, no one dared say it out loud, the family said. Ido said he acted optimistic for his parents until authorities came to notify them that her body was found, days later.\nSigal insisted on identifying Gaya’s body, despite the family’s protests.\n“She lay there as she was, gentle and peaceful, there was nothing on her face. I hugged her, I held onto every bit of her body I could. I told her that I was letting her go and that we will love her. And I think she heard me,” said her mom.\nFriends and family members described a sweet, smiling, bright young woman. who has been set to start studying for an academic degree in economics.\n“Gaya, our angel, cousin, and in general the most perfect, smiling, pure and kind-hearted woman,” wrote her cousin on Facebook. “You will be missed by so many people.”\nAt her family home in Kiryat Ono, Gaya’s bedroom remains as it was the night she left for the massive party. She loved music and had been excited to go to the festival.\nGaya’s belongings were returned to her parents and lay on the bed: a pair of grey sweatpants, a package of lollipops she bought for herself and her friends, and her cellphone.\nThe phone was found strewn on the ground in the vicinity of the shattered car.\nGaya’s parents were able to retrieve a short clip of her and Romi from the party, and a photo she took while hiding from Hamas terrorists. They were also able to see the text exchange with Shimoni, who insisted on coming back to get her and friends in what would be his last heroic attempted rescue.\nHis body was found five days after October 7.\nAfter the funeral, Gaya’s whole family — Avi, Sigal, Ido, and her sister Noga — each got a tattoo identical to Gaya’s: of a gramophone with a heart built in so she could “stay close.”\nHer parents added the date 7.10.2023.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

We are pained and can’t believe he is no longer with us, and are comforted that we were privileged to know such a special person.”\nGaby Gaon, the mayor of Mazkeret Batya, described Hasid as “a man of values and generosity, a loving family man and wonderful grandfather… a happy man with suspenders and a mustache, with a sense of humor and Yiddish jokes. He was an avid lover of archaeology and the history of the Jewish people.”\nHasid’s friend, Gideon Israeli, wrote on Facebook about his late friend, “a father, a grandfather, a brother, a friend… a kind grandfather with suspenders, a paratrooper, a farmer, a hard worker, an entrepreneur.”\n“Shraga was a happy man, with a sense of humor, a man of family and friends who was taken from us cruelly too soon,” he wrote. “His memory is with all of us.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Like many other Israeli families on October 7, the only defense the Bachar family of Kibbutz Be’eri has was the door to their safe room and their ability to hold it closed while terrorists tried to force their way in.\nWhen the attack began, the Bachar family — father Avida, mother Dana, 15-year-old son Carmel and 13-year-old daughter Hadar — ran to the safe room in their house. The terrorists forced their way into the home and shouted at the family to come out of the safe room. While Avida tried to keep the door closed, the terrorists opened fire and managed to hit both Avida and Carmel.\nSpeaking from a bed at Soroka Hospital in Beersheba almost 10 days later, Avida told Channel 12 News how Hadar, who was lightly wounded, took over the situation and began frantically making calls on three different phones, calling Magen David Adom and anyone else she could while the terrorists lit the door on fire and smoke began to fill the safe room.\nThe terrorists then threw grenades into the room, two of which exploded. They also shot Dana, who lost consciousness and was gone.\n“I told my daughter, mom doesn’t feel any pain anymore,” Avida said from his hospital bed.\nHadar and Avida were eventually rescued and evacuated to Soroka Hospital, where doctors had no choice but to amputate one of Avida’s legs.\nIn a tweet on October 16, longtime Channel 13 correspondent in the south Almog Boker wrote: “Dana Bachar, who raised all of the babies on Kibbutz Be’eri, was murdered along with her son by the Nazis of Hamas in Kibbutz Be’eri. Carmel’s last words were, ‘I want you bury me with my surfboard.’”\nIn the photo montage video that accompanies the tweet, Carmel can be seen in a wet suit in the churning surf next to the wave breakers of an Israeli beach, goofing off with friends in a photo booth, mugging for the camera somewhere on a hiking trail, embracing loved ones at one family home after another. Dana is seen as a loving mother in photos from a different world, a kindergarten teacher that so many Israelis would recognize from the days when their own kids were younger, when the same smile greeted them every morning.\nThe couple’s older son, Rotem, wrote of Dana on Facebook that “to be your son is to walk through the kibbutz and see the dozens of children that passed through your hands and grew up to be amazing kids. To be your son is know how to hold a baby, to put a baby to sleep, to feed, hug, love, and respect it.”\nRotem wrote about how his mom was always thrilled to see a pregnant mom-to-be and would whisper in his ear “See, she’s pregnant, you can tell, she’s beaming” — and she was never wrong.\nHe described a mother who raised her children — and those of the kibbutz — with tremendous care, who always gave anyone she spoke to her full attention, who always spread love and light anywhere she went.\n“Ima, I can say so much more about you but I don’t want to sum it all up, this isn’t the time, you were so, so young. You didn’t live to see Carmel’s kids, Nofar’s, Hadar’s or mine,” Rotem said in his post.\nDana, 48, was buried next to her 15-year-old son at Kibbutz Shiller almost two weeks after the massacre. A surfboard could be seen on top of his coffin in photos from the funeral.\nAnat Shemla wrote on Facebook about meeting Carmel when he took part in an initiative between Kibbutz Be’eri and the “Mifrasim” sailing club in Herzliya. The project brought together 13 youth from the kibbutz to take part in a sailing course held over an entire year. At the end of the course, the team went on a five-day sailing trip to Cyprus and back.\nShe described Carmel as a curious, always helpful boy, with a joyful smile. She also remembered that “he always loved to have his hands on the wheel, and not just anytime, but for hours, in a storm or when it was cold or dark. I would take a peek to see if you were OK and you would instantly smile and calm me down. You were only 15 years old, but we all knew we had someone we could count on.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Shiraz Brodash, 23, from Ramot Meir, and Israel Police Master Sgt. Avshalom Peretz, 27, from Netivot, were killed together on October 7 in southern Israel.\nAccording to accounts from family and friends, Avshalom, an officer in the Yamam counter-terror unit, had been called up to the front line, and was taking his girlfriend home first to safety before going to fight. Neither of them ever made it. Accounts varied as to whether the couple was killed by a rocket impact or a grenade as they neared the Sha’ar Hanegev Junction outside Sderot.\nYarin Abu, Avshalom’s friend and brother-in-law, memorialized his friend as “our Yamam fighter, the pride of our family who has become the pride of the nation.”\nAbu wrote on Facebook that Avshalom “was called up Saturday morning to the unit you were so proud to serve in. Half the country was sleeping and had no idea what was happening, and you were on the way to your team. To protect us.” He said that Avshalom was always modest about his security service, “because that’s who you were, bashful to an annoying degree — you had so much modesty and humility.”\nYael Yaakobi, Avshalom’s aunt, recalled him as “our protector… our prince… our hero.”\n“A deep hole has been opened in my heart that will never heal,” Yaakobi wrote on social media. “You played with everyone, you taught everyone, you were a friend, a brother, an uncle and most of all my beloved nephew… shy, with smiling eyes, a huge heart.”\nShiraz was an athlete and personal trainer who had previously competed nationally as a 100m. sprinter, and won a national youth championship in 2018.\nHer aunt, Sarit Hadad, said she was heartbroken “that I will never see your smile again, which radiated such love.”\n“How can the world go on without your heart and your generosity?” Hadad wrote on Facebook. “Who will train with such love and dedication all the trainees you loved so much?” Hadad said that Shiraz had “found the love of your life — an angel just like you — and on Saturday you returned together to heaven… we awoke to a black reality that we will have to turn into color… how do we go on from here? How?”\nHadad said that Shiraz “cooked from the heart, trained from the heart, gave from the heart and entered so deeply into all of our hearts. That’s why our hearts are so broken. My love, I feel like a piece of my body has been physically torn away.”\nShiraz’s friend Linoy Barlev said she couldn’t come to terms with the news of her death, writing on Instagram that she had pictured instead her being kidnapped “and trying to cheer up the people around you and give them hope — because that’s who you were!”\nBarlev wrote that Shiraz was “one big light, and the most optimistic girl I have ever met… you always knew how to compliment me and cheer me up when I needed you. Everywhere you went you brought joy with you, and you could make me laugh for hours!” She said that Shiraz had told her excitedly about dating Avshalom, “all of your plans for the future with Avshalom, the ring you picked out… two angels, now you are together up there watching over us from above.”\nLast year, Shiraz dedicated a post on Facebook to her mother after she had recovered from brain surgery: “My heroic mother, who went through a turbulent time in which she and I experienced the hardest situation we’ve ever had in life, when she was in life-threatening danger — everything else suddenly took on different proportions. Hug your loved ones and appreciate every little thing in life.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was buried on October 10 in Modiin.\nGoutin was brought up in Beit Shemesh and then moved with his parents to Modiin Maccabim-Reut. He grew up practicing judo and became a national champion in the youth division and a member of the youth national team.\n“Yonatan was an outstanding athlete, Israeli champion for [the] children [division], second-place champion for youth and a member of the youth team,” said Igor Romanitsky, head of Modiin Maccabim-Reut’s local judo club.\n“He had the possibility of becoming an outstanding athlete in the army, but he chose to be in combat,” Romanitsky told the local paper Modiin news.\nGoutin served in the Multidomain Unit, also known as the Ghost Unit, established in 2020 to incorporate a wide range of capabilities from various branches of the military: infantry troops, fighter jets, attack helicopters, tanks, combat engineering, drones, K-9s and robotics.\nRomanitsky said Goutin was “one of the best trainees I’ve had in the 30 years I’ve been coaching,” describing him as a “an uncompromising fighter,” training through months with an injury, a beloved teammate and son, a positive person, and someone who showed respect to his opponents.\n“We were close, I loved him,” he said, adding that he hopes to “hold a national competition in his memory.”\nRomanitsky said he heard Goutin “went from house to house to rescue families. He and his teammates saved three families. By the fourth house they entered, it was over.”\nOren Smadja, a former competitive judoka and the head coach of the Israel National Team wrote on Facebook that when Goutin and other fighters in his unit arrived at the kibbutz, “it was already clear that they had reached hell.”\n“They were given a mission to join and assist a force of paratroopers, which had suffered heavy losses, in a rescue mission of the residents of Be’eri. The lieutenant commander who led the force wanted to be sure about each of the fighters who would go on the mission with him and asked Yonatan: ‘Are you sure you want to enter?’ And Yonatan answered him: ‘I’m with you completely, brother,'” Smajda said.\n“He was determined, focused and cold — just like he was before judo battles,” he described.\nA woman whose daughter was close friends with Goutin and knew his family wrote on Facebook that he “grew up in an endlessly loving home, a home that sanctified life.”\nShe said Yonatan’s father eulogized him and recounted how when he gave him a ride down south on October 7, told him “don’t be a hero.”\n“But Yonatan couldn’t not be a hero.

Their tires shot out, they fled to Moshav Yachini and hid in a concrete bunker near the moshav entrance. When the Hamas terrorists arrived, Ilan stepped out of the bunker and tried to convince them that he was alone. He then managed in his final moments to open the trunk of the couple’s car and toss the keys inside so his wife would have a chance to flee when given an opening.\nThe gunmen found Ayala but she and her friend managed to get to the trunk of the car where they hid until they were rescued by police, the couple’s daughter Ofek said.\nFor 18 days, Ilan was considered missing. His body was eventually identified and he was laid to rest on the afternoon of October 25 in Beit Aryeh.\nThe town was home to the couple and their daughter Ofek, 30, who said she always knew when her dad was home from work by the trance music that she — and the entire town — could hear blasting out of the house.\nOfek said her father was “a man who was endlessly generous, the perfect father who people wanted to be next to. Everyone remembers the magic and the experiences they had with you.”\nIsraeli media reported that Ilan and Ayala met when they were 15 years old and were inseparable ever since. They were known throughout the trance music scene in Israel and were beloved by countless fellow travelers who sought abandon, peace, and deliverance in the speakers and the pulsing crowds driven by the same extremely Israeli party vibe.\nOwing to the joy he brought to life and the never-ending party that he MC’d, Ilan did not have a typical funeral. The event was described as a colorful gathering jampacked with friends and coursing with love.\nThe Mako news site quoted a friend of Ilan’s who described the traffic jam at the entrance to Beit Aryeh just before his funeral, which an estimated 2,500 people attended.\n“It was like the entrance of a giant festival. You were a father, brother, uncle, and friend of countless people. Thousands came to escort you on your final journey skywards.”\nAttendees were asked not to wear black, to come in a rainbow of colors and wear wristbands with Ilan’s name on them — just like at a rave.\nAs Ofek said, his grave was covered with flowers, bandanas, spray bottles and candies, everything that was him. The family made sure to bury him with a wristband on his arm. Heartbroken, Ofek said that she was grateful that she didn’t lose both of her parents and that she knew what her father would want from her now.\n“The most important thing to him was that we would be strong, that we take care of mom and strengthen her, and that we carry out his will — that we never stop dancing.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Yuval Bar founded a collective recycling program on the kibbutz. Maayan Bar was responsible for kibbutz job placements.\nTheir daughter Noya Bar shared a harrowing picture from the home’s safe room, which was destroyed and burned, and where the family “once felt safe,” she said.\n“Watch over us from above. We miss you and we’ll miss you forever,” their son, Itay Bar, wrote on Facebook on October 18, adding that their deaths left a “huge hole in our hearts.”\n“I’m sure you were together until the last second… the best parents and grandparents,” he wrote.\nIn his eulogy, which he shared to Facebook, Itay Bar described a tight-knit family, with loving parents and grandparents who were actively involved in their children’s lives and careers, and who offered a warm upbringing and a music- and story-filled home.\n“You and your home were for me a kingdom of freedom, love and contentment. Visiting you at the kibbutz after all the craziness of my life outside of it was, for me, like sitting on a rainbow,” wrote Bar. He recounted long nights of working as a deejay or out with friends, crashing at his parents’ home, and waking up to his mother’s singing and hearing his father puttering around the house waiting for him to emerge from his childhood bedroom to talk.\nIt was “a house of freedom and chaos, talking, shouting, jumping from conversation to conversation and topic to topic within seconds. I miss it so much.”\nHe joked about his father quickly falling asleep in the armchair for Thursday night basketball games on TV and abruptly waking to cheer when he heard his son, before falling asleep again 30 seconds later.\n“There were times I woke him up on purpose and got excited even when I didn’t need to be, just to see him like that again.”\n“They took my amazing father and mother from me and my sisters, they took from my nephews the grandparents they loved so much, they took from my grandmother her oldest and dearest son, they took from my uncles such a good brother and sister. Wherever I look I will notice who they took you from, because that’s who you were. A huge light and an open and giving heart to everyone. For me, you were my most basic and natural security and home in this world,” he wrote.\n“People, or rather monsters, full of darkness, evil and war cut short the lives of my parents full of light, love and peace.

Mom — you were always so proud that I was your spitting image, and today I’m just trying with all of my strength to carry on and figure out how I can keep living, but without you all I am lost.”\nHe also spoke of how he asked his parents for a little brother “and I received an angel.” An angel that was murdered on October 7, two years to the day since he celebrated his bar mitzvah.\nIn her eulogy, Tomer thanked her parents “for teaching me to love life. People often say that in cases like this, the body is torn apart — but I feel whole. Maybe that’s because you were always inside of me, or I just refuse to accept reality. I can’t believe that I am forced to say goodbye to you all in such a cruel way.”\nOn Facebook, Tal Zandman wrote: “10 years ago I arrived at the Zak family home for the first time. I was a lone soldier on Kibbutz Kissufim and the amazing Zak family was my adopted family. Etti and Itay are the warmest people anywhere, and without knowing me at all they treated me like a member of the family from day one. And in my mind, Sagi will forever remain the little boy with a giant smile and crazy energy. Thank you for being my family.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Nitzan Libstein, 19, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7.\nHe was the son of Ofir Libstein, head of the Sha’ar Hanegev Regional Council, who was killed fighting the terrorist invasion as a member of the kibbutz’s local security team. Ofir’s death was confirmed quickly and his body recovered, but the Libstein family searched desperately for news about Nitzan for 12 days, hoping he would be found wounded or even kidnapped before they were ultimately informed of his death.\nNitzan’s maternal grandmother, Bilha Epstein, 81, was also murdered in the attack, as well as his first cousin, Netta Epstein, 22.\n“I can’t believe that 48 hours later we’re back in the same place, with a heart in even more pain,” Nitzan’s mother, Vered, said at his funeral, held two days after Ofir’s ceremony. “You were a child full of heart, the first to lend a hand when help was needed.”\nVered described the horrible moments as the family tried to hide from terrorists in Kfar Aza: “I’m sorry we left you alone against the murderers,” she said, according to Ynet, of Nitzan, who was in the kibbutz’s youth living quarters when the assault began.\n“You were wounded and you made yourself a tourniquet, and even then you held onto the door of the safe room,” she continued. “We asked them to come rescue you and they never came. My survivor, I can’t believe your journey ends here. Thank you that I was your mother. Watch over dad up above.”\nHadas Ragolsky, a family friend, wrote that she knew Nitzan from the day he was born: “Little one, who for a while now has not been little, but would still smile bashfully when someone would call you that. Your mother, Vered… said she relied so much on your resourcefulness, even though you were the one with fears of what was to come after you were caught in a mortar attack as a child. You managed to overcome and became a promising young man — you were supposed to enlist in the IDF right now, which will no longer happen.”\nStav Guy Ben Shabat, who used to work at the school Nitzan attended, lamented the promising life cut short.\n“If only everyone could have known Nitzan,” she wrote. “If only everyone could have known this boy, who wasn’t afraid of his fears, who wanted to overcome them. If only you could have all known Nitzan, a boy who came to work on himself and emerged larger than life, a model for self-improvement.”\n“If only you could all have seen and heard your stubbornness, your refusal to accept half-explanations, your ability to drive the person in front of you crazy in the name of justice,” she added. “If only everyone could have known Nitzan. You should have known him, he should have been our prime minister in just a few more years… if only this sweet child had received a different ending.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

His son Eliad, 23, also volunteered for not-for-profit social organizations.\nEliad Ohayon. (Courtesy of the family)\nDr. Eilon Schwartz, who heads the Shaharit Institute, recalled that Ohayon had invited him to his succah on October 5 to give a lesson at an event entitled “Learning and listening together,” at which Rabbi Avi Giser, one of the founders of the Zohar rabbinical organization, also spoke. The program brings two people with different social, cultural, religious, and/or political views taught together.\n“Moshe was radiant at the event,” Schwartz wrote. “There were about 50 to 60 people there, and Moshe was filled with joy that some of his colleagues and closest friends had traveled to Ofakim to join him and his community.”\nSchwartz went on, “On Saturday morning, which was the holiday of Simchat Torah, Moshe and his son Eliad were murdered. He [Moshe] heard gunshots in the neighborhood, and ran out of the house with Eliad, gun in hand.”\n“When we heard the story, we all smiled through our tears and said, ‘That was Moshe, the first one out the door. Always in front.'”\nThe two men’s bodies were not found until late Sunday afternoon.\nOrna Angel, a well-known architect and activist, posted on Facebook on October 14 that it had taken her days to be able to write something about Ohayon.\nThe two worked together for several years at the Mandel Northern Leadership Center.\n“We became friends right away, and we knew that no political opinions, kippot on the head, or shrimps on Shabbat, could overcome the love we both felt for our country, the desire for it to be better here.”\nShe went on, “Your family came above all else…And when I heard that you fought like a lion, with your oldest son Eliad, through the sorrow and the immense pain, I smiled — you and your beloved Eliad. Moshe Ohayon, I will never forget you.”\nRabbi Benny Lau, who created 929, described Ohayon as “the essence of good.”\nThe last thing Ohayon did was to have 250 temporary dwellings used on the holiday of Sukkot erected all over Israel where people of different backgrounds and views could come together and talk, he said.\nMoshe Ohayon is survived by his parents, his wife, Sarit, and his four surviving children, Amitai, Yair, Shira and Uri.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Her grandson, Itay Svirksy, is believed to be held captive in Gaza. The 95-year-old survived the attack.\nSela’s daughter, Osnat Weinberg, told the Makor Rishon newspaper that by all accounts Cabrera protected Sela’s life.\nWeinberg said that when rocket sirens began to ring early Saturday morning in the kibbutz, Cabrera brought Sela into the safe room and shut the door, continuing to update the family via WhatsApp, telling them that she heard terrorists inside the house. “For hours she held the handle of the door closed to try and stop the terrorists coming in,” she said.\nWeinberg said they lost connection with Cabrera around noon, and later filled in the blanks from other survivors, who said that the terrorists brought both Cabrera and Sela to the balcony of her home and held them hostage there. She said when the family was finally reunited with her mother, she arrived with all her supplies, including medicine and fruit packed up in the basket of her walker.”Only Grace could have gotten her ready like that,” said Weinberg.\n“Her composure, her wisdom and her best intentions for my mother were far beyond the realm of ordinary,” added Weinberg. “She was simply an angel with her feet on the ground. What a good soul, how wise… we are so thankful to the wonderful Grace who became part of our family, and we are crying over her loss.”\nAviva Sela and Grace Cabrera (Facebook)\nAviva’s niece, Tamar Ben-Tzvi, attended a memorial service for Cabrera and said that “every word said there was complete truth. A noble woman who risked her life protecting Aviva. A woman who came from a quiet and safe country to Israel, in order to work and send money to her family in the Philippines. Gracie knew that she had two families — her family in the Philippines and her family in Israel. Gracie was as her name, a woman full of grace and love.”\nNimisha Vargese, a carer from India who also worked on Kibbutz Be’eri, said they both arrived at the kibbutz around the same time, “and the friendship started from that day… may your family and friends bear your loss… we miss you, dear.”\nCabrera’s sister, Mary June Prodigo, who also worked as a carer on the same kibbutz, said she was struggling to come to terms with the loss.\n“No words can explain the pain I feel right now… I lost my sister/best friend,” she wrote on Facebook. “Now everything is gone… all the happy memories will be replaced by pain.”\nProdigo lamented the cruel way in which her sister’s life was cut short: “I miss you… I don’t know if I can handle it… but I will do it for you… for our family… Someday we will drink a lot of breezer together, go for a walk, enjoy our trip, pick the fruits that we love… someday, together, we will laugh, make jokes, have fun, hug and kiss each other.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She was only found 11 days later, and on October 22, all three family members were laid to rest side by side at the Yarkon cemetery in Petach Tikvah.\nA friend of Yona’s, Sharon Abramovitz, wrote, “I’ll miss our phone calls, your support, the ease about you, your patience, and the powerful and strengthening sensitivity you had. You were always smiling, like a ray of sunshine.”\nAn obituary shared on the Kibbutz Be’eri website noted that Mila was born on December 29, 2022, “and brought light and love” into the lives of her parents and brothers, “and for nine months, everyone enjoyed the family harmony that Mila created around her… until that cursed Saturday.”\nOhad was a longtime Maccabi Tel Aviv FC fan and worked as the Salesforce Project Manager for Elad Software at their Sderot office.\nIn a post on Facebook, Elad wrote of Ohad that “it was hard not to fall in love with his bashful smile. He was the type of person that you could talk to about anything. An intelligent, funny, and talented man — a true friend. A rare blend of the directness of a kibbutznik and unusual sensitivity.”\nLast year, Cohen was selected by the charity “51 for the Promotion of Gender Quality” as one of the 51 people “helping assure a better future.”\nA friend of Ohad’s, Shai Baruch wrote on Facebook that “in the brief conversations I had with Ohad on the kibbutz I always felt tranquility and love. Ohad loved sports and he mainly loved [tennis player] Roger Federer. He traveled to see many matches and always chose to be happy.”\nOhad was an athlete, father, husband, fitness guy, and as of two years ago, a guitar player.\nIn April 2022, Ohad uploaded a video to his Facebook page in which he can be seen strumming an acoustic guitar. In the caption he wrote, “I always dreamed of playing guitar. To sit with my kids and sing a little for the soul. A year ago I decided to buy a guitar and make my dream come true.”\nThis past week, a video he posted singing the Yehuda Poliker song “Flower” went viral, the words taking on a heartrending meaning in the wake of the Cohen family’s unfathomable loss: “They took your life from you. Oh holy wars, angels wept for you with dry eyes. Your smile, baby girl, they buried it in the ground. How silence grows from this turmoil.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

They never heard from her again.\nShe is survived by her four children, Nahar, Carmel, Dror and Ayana, and a number of grandchildren. Her family insisted on her being buried in Be’eri in a small funeral amid the ongoing war.\nA kibbutz eulogy recounts that Neta moved to Israel after meeting the man who would become her husband while he was visiting the US. She went to visit him at Be’eri, where he was born, and never left the kibbutz. The pair settled there and had four children, but later divorced.\nMore than a decade after arriving in Israel, Neta trained as a midwife and became an integral part of the labor ward at Soroka for many years, “standing out as a midwife who treated every mother with respect and kindness no matter their race, religion or language,” according to the kibbutz, which estimated that she helped deliver thousands of babies over the years.\nMonique Attias, the head midwife at Soroka, wrote, “Adrienne was a unique woman with a huge soul and a sensitive and professional midwife. She educated generations of midwives with her simplicity and charm and instilled confidence in all of us… working with a sense of mission and high sensitivity.”\nNeta was also a part of a volunteer delegation from Israel which traveled to Nepal in 2015 to assist following a devastating earthquake there, the kibbutz noted.\nShe retired several years ago but continued to volunteer at the Rimon Farm in northern Negev, which uses sustainable agriculture and a supportive community environment to help youth at risk aged 14 to 18. The farm noted that she would be remembered “as a person filled with kindness, as a mature woman with the spirit and energy of a vibrant and youthful girl.”\nHer friend Eshkar Eldan Cohen, who noted that they had known each other for more than 40 years, wrote a tribute to her on the 30-day anniversary of her death.\n“She was a unique woman, always hugging her children and grandchildren, with rolling laughter on her lips,” she wrote. “Her Hebrew was soft and gentle… as a midwife, she helped bring life into the world. As a volunteer with youth, she helped find them a place in the world.”\nCohen wrote that she recalled meeting up with Neta a few years ago and having a long conversation: “I don’t remember what was said, but I remember the open heart, the hug for her grandchildren… Adrienne, you left the US and came here for love.

She was buried on October 17 in Netanya.\n“A girl with a smile, with joy for life, so mature, so rebellious, so unique,” her friend Lee Rubin Danan wrote on Facebook. “You went to a party to celebrate life and you never came back… you left an impact on my life and I’ll never forget you.”\nVainshtein particularly loved the music of Eden Hason, and the singer readily agreed to her family’s request to sing at her funeral, where he performed “Red Sunsets.”\nAs a child, Vainshtein appeared on the kid’s reality TV show “Boys vs. Girls.” Arutz Hayeladim, the children’s TV network, said it was devastated to learn of the death of a “beloved and standout contestant” on the show.\n“You were a girl with a pure heart, full of joy for life, with strong family values, a love of children and a good heart,” wrote her family member, Galina Vainshtein, in a social media post following her funeral. “Now you have wings and you are free, our angel.”\nLiel’s friend Maytal wrote on Facebook: “I want the world to know about you… I was privileged to know you, we worked together and you entered my heart.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He got into the driver’s seat to try and bring Odaya and the two young girls to safety at the Sderot police station, without knowing that it had been taken over by terrorists.\nBoth Abu Sabila and Odaya were murdered. Romi, 6, and Lia, 3, were lying on the floor of the car and were unscathed. Harrowing video footage from that day shows the two young girls screaming for help as police officers arrived. “Are you police?” the young voice of Romi can be heard from inside the car. “Are you from Israel? Take us!”\nOfficers managed to bring the girls to safety in a nearby stranger’s house, where they hid in the safe room until their grandparents could be tracked down.\nOdaya and Dolev’s family told Ynet that the couple met in Eilat during their military service in the Navy, and got married in 2015.\n“They were a wonderful couple and full of joy for life, they would all dance together as a family every day,” their family added.\n“Dolev, my dear son, who will I handle the longing and the sadness?” wrote his mother Eliana on Facebook. “How? Watch over us from above the way you did down here, and send me strength every day please.”\nZohar Blum, the deputy mayor of Rehovot, said Dolev is his wife’s nephew, and the family is heartbroken over the immense loss.\n“A young couple whose lives were cut short during a war just because of their geographical closeness to the Gaza Strip, and the unbelievable ease with which terrorists infiltrated their home,” wrote Blum. “An incredible couple who left two young and pure girls behind, orphaned.”\nLimor Moses described Odaya as “always smiling, always happy, so beloved, light-hearted, beautiful and funny… just incredible at everything!

He enlisted in the Air Force and started the aviation course before joining the Egoz anti-guerrilla warfare unit.\nHis family, friends, teachers, coaches and commanders all remembered Sasson as a true leader.\nHis parents, Aliza and David, said Sasson always wanted to be a fighter like his late grandfather, Michael Peretz, who fought in the War of Independence. “He felt it was his mission,” they said. “The defense of his people, the pride of the unit and teamwork were important to him.”\nTwo others from his squad, Staff Sgt. Jonathan Savitsky and Staff Sgt. Amit Peled, were also killed in the October 7 battle.\nSasson’s friends said that he was very generous, curious and loved helping people. He enjoyed cooking meals for them and organizing movie nights and hiking trips. He also had a great sense of humor and liked to laugh, and could see the good side of everything. He had an adventurous spirit and was looking forward to traveling with friends after his military service, which was half a year away, and then pursuing higher studies.\n“Elad knew he would be a doctor,” his parents said. “Even though he had a talent and passion for playing the guitar, he felt it was an important mission to save lives.”\n“If everyone succeeds like Elad in doing just a little, giving a little more love, being a little more kind, or simply not hate, maybe then we will succeed in making this world a better place,” his father David Sasson said.\nHis girlfriend Amit Shustak also mourned Sasson: “You are our angel, my angel.

He was due to be discharged from the army in five months.\nSavitsky and his team had been sent south to the border with Gaza to help retake an army post that had been overrun by Hamas terrorists. During a seven-hour gun battle, he helped save 50 people: 32 female unarmed soldiers from the border observation unit, three citizens, including one of the commanding officer’s wife with their baby, and 14 soldiers from the Golani unit, many of them injured, who were at the base.\nHis commanding officer said Savitsky fought bravely. “He was a true professional and was willing to take on any mission with a smile,” he said, adding that is why he twice received honorable mentions and made him his front marksman.\nSavitsky, from Modiin, is survived by his parents, Bella and Gershon, and older sister Lina.\nIn a eulogy, his family said: “Jonathan will forever be missed. His smile and laughter filled the room. He was so strong and handsome and the politest person around. He made friends easily and was always humble.”\n“He was well-loved by everyone and people from all parts of his life came to pay respect, telling us how much his presence was like a beacon of light,” they added. “Even strangers who met him training at the gym told us how much they were envious of his strength and kindness.”\nHis girlfriend of four years, Adi Harel, also mourned Savitsky: “I knew you were the best when I met you. Every mother would pray for her daughter to have a partner like you. You were perfect. In these moments of sadness, only you would know the words to comfort me.”\nIn an interview with N12 news in May, his mother Bella, described him as a “super-responsible man who you could count on if he told you he was ‘on it.’ He was a bit of a prankster with a sense of humor and a person who was fun to hang out with, but when he was in his job, there was nobody like him when it came to operational quality.”\nBella said her son was preparing to take on a combat role from age 14, “it was very important for him to get ready, so much so that he spent four years at the gym and in a combat strength class.” He took his military service “very seriously,” she said, noting that at a certain point she asked him to step back from combat because of the stress on her, “and he said to me, ‘Mom, I can’t, I was trained, I’m really good at it, somebody needs to do it.'”\nIn the battle on October 7, she said, “he advanced ahead together with his commander on the front line, and as I know my son, he was very sharp, focused. That’s what his friends said about him — he was the guy you’d want next to you in battle.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was buried at the Mt. Herzl military cemetery in Jerusalem in the presence of his parents, grandparents, and sister, Chloé, who came from France. Three hundred people attended his funeral.\nBorn in France to a non-practicing Jewish family, Ghanassia attended law school in Montpellier. It was there that he got involved with the Olami Association (meaning “My World” in Hebrew), which engages young Jews between the ages of 18 and 30 in social activities, Shabbat meals, debates and other activities, recalls the association’s president, Yann Arnoux.\nGhnassia had taken Hebrew classes at Olami before coming to Israel in 2022. Although he was not religious, his search for his identity led him to Israel, say those who knew him in Montpellier.\n“He wasn’t religious, his family was not active in the Jewish community. He sometimes went to the synagogue with his maternal grandfather, but he questioned his Jewishness a lot,” added Yann Arnoux.\n“Valentin asked himself a lot of questions, notably on the impact that he could have as a Jew,” confirmed Ghnassia’s university friend Carla Mathiou to AFP.\n“He was always joyous, always with a smile. He was also very sensible, but he loved to move and party,” said Mathiou, who now lives in Montreal but had remained in contact with Ghnassia. “In Montpellier, we are a little community, so when one of us dies, we lose a brother.”\nGhnassia studied law “because he cared about defending the other, but he also wanted to be on the ground,” confided another of his friends in Montpellier, who preferred to stay anonymous, recalling a boy who was “a ray of sun.”\n“In Israel, he discovered a country that embraced his identity, without fear of any problems. If we wanted to integrate into Israel, the army is a passageway,” said Arnoux.\nAfter his service, Ghnassia “wanted to start a business, to make money” because he had an “adventurous side” and he “was buzzing” with projects. “And then he had reached this level of maturity that made him want to start a family,” he added.\nHis mother, Geneviève Molina, gave an emotional testimony in a video, sharing her “enormous suffering.” There, she described Ghnassia as “very playful, very active, very energetic, always giving hugs, warm.”\nShe said he was very fulfilled in Israel and was very attached to the country he discovered thanks to a Taglit trip.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Baruch insisted that her unit commanders draft her following the October 7 onslaught on Israel by Hamas terrorists.\n“I just needed to hear myself propose to her,” Yanai told Channel 13 after the funeral. “I looked at her, at her grave, I told her about our life together and how from a very young age, she stole my heart,” he said.\nBaruch’s story has resonated with countless Israelis who have been exposed to it because it underscores both the patriotic devotion triggered by the attack and the price it has exacted on Israeli society, which has lost hundreds of young, promising and inspiring people like Baruch.\nNot long after her death, 27 Chabad rabbis from the United States who are visiting Israel on a solidarity mission met with Baruch’s parents, Orit and Avraham, in Kiryat Netafim, a religious town near Barkan.\n“We saw immediately where Adi of blessed memory got her qualities,” said Ruvi New, a Chabad rabbi of Boca Raton, Florida, referencing Adi Baruch’s parents. “Our mission here is to uplift spirits but we found ourselves being uplifted ourselves by Orit and Avraham, their faith and fortitude,” New, a 56-year-old father of 10, told The Times of Israel.\nDavid Eliezrie, another Chabad rabbi from California, said that Adi Baruch’s story “represents the unity in the People of Israel at this time.”\nOrit Baruch told the visiting rabbis about her daughter. Yanai, her grieving would-be fiancé, wanted to leave the ring with Adi’s parents, Orit told the rabbis. But she asked him to keep it, “recover emotionally and find another woman to start a family with,” New said, quoting the bereaved mother.\nAdi Baruch sent her mother a picture of herself smiling while wearing her uniform as she headed down to Sderot. She was satisfied that her lobbying with her unit resulted in a draft order conscripting her.\nAvi, her father, who was also drafted, had proposed she sit out the fighting. She replied: “You did not raise me to sit it out here,” the parents recalled while meeting with the rabbis.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Noam was the second oldest in the family.\nRojtenbarg grew up in a Haredi family but later broke with his upbringing, becoming secular and enlisting in the IDF. He was classified as a “lone soldier” due to his family’s lack of support for his path.\nHe attended the rave with four siblings from the Rivlin family, who had also left an ultra-Orthodox upbringing — two of the brothers were slain and two survived.\n“Noam, this war will be the last. We don’t want to live like that. The blood you shed will be avenged a hundred-fold,” vowed Col. Nissim Yitzhaki, who led the fallen soldier’s battalion, at his funeral on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. “Difficult days lie ahead for us as we face this cowardly and cruel enemy.”\nRabbi Yitzhak Revah, who runs the religious school that Rojtenbarg attended in his youth, said at his funeral: “You are dead because you were Jewish… It’s unbearable.”\nHis friend Eden Danieli remembered Rojtenbarg on Facebook as “so pure-hearted.”\n“I can’t believe you are already gone for two weeks,” he wrote. “I miss our calls on Friday afternoon and the laughter after holiday meals. I will never forget you.”\nHis father, Rabbi Aryeh Rojtenbarg, requested that Opposition Leader Yair Lapid — a staunch secularist — visit the family during the traditional mourning period in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Ramot, because he wants to use his son’s death “to work toward unity… we are one people.”\nIn an interview with Ynet several months after his son’s death, Aryeh said Noam was “very smart, like my wife, way above average. We had a joke at home that Noam could take any machine and break it, just to check how it worked, and then rebuild it.”\nHe said Noam was very sociable, and at his funeral “there were 2,500 people, from across the spectrum, friends from yeshiva and school and also those who were totally secular. Everyone was in touch with him because of his charisma.”\nDespite the difficulties for his family when he left the Haredi world, Aryeh said they continued to maintain a loving bond: “When he would come home for a visit they would jump on him, all his brothers and sisters, and talk about his world. If one of his brothers had a test in Gemara the next day, he would sit with him, a test in math, sit with them. Everyone felt buddies with him.”\nAryeh said first and foremost he wants to “give thanks to God for what he gave, there is no shortage of what to give thanks for. The pain is pain… but we gave thanks to Hashem that he gave him to us for 24 years.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

To sit and rest on a bench, to laugh with Mom, with Elad, with a friend who stopped for a moment to rest beside you… you really loved Chaim Peri and Aviv Atzili who worked with you in the garage [and were killed by Hamas]… your heart would have broken, Dad. At least now your heart is not broken.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

You succeed in deterring 20 armed terrorists, and you sacrificed your life.”\nRaz added that it was “unthinkable that I will no longer hear your unique laughter — a friend of 15 years, my brother.”\nVovk was a longtime diving volunteer with the ZAKA rescue and retrieval organization, taking part in dozens of life-saving missions over the years.\n“Throughout his life Danny acted with great devotion to other people, just as he did in his death,” the organization said in a statement.\nNoam Kalush, who also lived in Netiv Ha’asara, noted on Facebook that Vovk did not leave behind any immediate family, and he wanted to ensure his memory lived on.\n“Danny was my neigbor, and I never met anyone like him… with a huge heart and so much soul and generosity,” he wrote. Kalush noted that while Vovk did not have children, he had informally adopted two teenagers with nowhere else to go, “and became their mother, father and grandmother.”\n“He would always offer to help here or go there, always with a smile and goodwill,” recalled Kalush.\nAlex Lev recalled his friend in a Facebook post as someone “who loved the sea and the sea loved him.

    "story": "Neither Noam or Yishay Slotki were in active military service when air raid sirens began to ring where they lived in Beersheba, early Saturday morning on October 7.\nBut when the two brothers began to realize the scale of the Hamas assault on Israel that day, they chose to race together to the frontline in an attempt to aid in defending the southern border towns under attack, even before they ever received a call-up to the reserves.\nMaster Sgt. (res.) Noam Slotki, 31, and Sgt. First Class Yishay Slotki, 24, were both killed that day in the fighting near Kibbutz Alumim. Five days later, the brothers — who each left behind a wife and a baby — were buried side by side on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.\nNoam most recently served as a combat medic in the Carmeli Brigade, while Yishay was a soldier in the Oded Brigade.\n“They understood that there was a need to help Israel immediately, that the army was not able to arrive at that time to save the towns near Gaza, and they took on the task themselves,” said their father, Rabbi Shmuel Slotki — the outgoing rabbi of the Young Israel synagogue in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Ramot, home to many immigrant families — in an interview with Arutz Sheva.\n“Like many others, they enlisted for this task on their own and without being called… it’s really an incredible thing — the spirit of heroism, the spirit of responsibility, dedication to the people of Israel,” he added.\nThe father of seven, Rabbi Slotki was called up at the start of the war to assist in the monumental effort to identify the bodies of those who were murdered by Hamas. He continued such work even during the five days when his two sons were unaccounted for, before their remains were discovered and their deaths confirmed.\nFollowing the mourning period, Yishay’s twin brother, Yonatan, returned to fighting on the front lines as a reservist along the northern border, admitting that it is “a little tough on my parents.”\n“People told me, ‘your brothers are heroes’ but to us it was so obvious — that’s the personal responsibility we grew up with,” Yonatan told Arutz Sheva. “As soon as you realize that it’s not just our family’s issue, not only our personal pain, but rather a story of the entire nation of Israel, to protect the State of Israel, everything else is dwarfed.”\nYonatan said losing a twin brother, after they grew up side by side and shared most of their lives together, was something “indescribable.”\nNoam’s former comrade, Omer Levy, eulogized his friend on Facebook as someone heroic and brave who always had a smile on their face.\n“You were the best among us — you were, even to speak about you in the past tense is unthinkable,” Levy wrote. “You were the best among us and you proved this on Shabbat, when you drove from Beersheba when you heard there was trouble in the south, you left a wife and a young daughter and you just went to save people.”\nLevy wrote that throughout their friendship, “You made the difficult things seem easy and you always did it with a smile…  during our last reservist training I remember that we saw each other and the smile and the joy and emotion felt automatic.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He is survived by his children as well as 18 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\nMoshe was the oldest resident of the small community which numbered only around 200 people before Hamas’s murderous rampage. His family said he was sent to a concentration camp at age 9, and succeeded in fleeing at age 11. He moved to Israel in 1951, ultimately joining the police force and serving as a detective.\nAfter retiring from the police force, Moshe worked with the Jewish Agency, managing absorption centers which housed Ethiopian immigrants in the 1980s and 1990s.\nHis care aide, Petru Boscov, a Moldovan citizen, was by his side and also murdered by Hamas. Army Radio said everyone in the kibbutz knew Ridler and Boscov from their daily walks to the post office and the market, walking slowly and greeting everyone along the way.\n“He was the ‘grandfather of Holit’ but he was also our grandfather,” his grandson, Amir Tessler, told Ynet. “He loved to dance and travel abroad… even as he aged, his love for his family, for life, he continued to give us great strength even after he surpassed age 90.”\nHis granddaughter, Einav Ridler, wrote on Facebook: “Hi grandpa — do you remember how the last few times we met you argued with us that you were 100 years old, and you insisted that we don’t know how to count? Who would have thought that you would not reach age 92 — and in such a tragic way, after as a child you experienced the starvation, cold and rain in a concentration camp and succeeded in escaping?”\nThe Foundation for the Welfare of Holocaust Victims said Ridler was born in Romania in 1931. His mother and one of his sisters were killed during the Holocaust. After he arrived in Israel, the organization said, he was so proud of the large family he established.\nTessler said, “Grandpa always said that if you have something to be proud of and show off — be proud of it. All his stories about the war, they were stories of hope, he would tell them with a lot of pride. It was important to him to pass on that legacy of never giving up.”\nHis daughter, Pnina Hendler, told the Canadian Global News site that her father would swim in the Holit pool every day, visit the grocery store and always “flirted with the girls, and he told stories.”\n“He danced with his walking stick,” she said. “He really enjoyed his life on the kibbutz… the little ones were very attached to him,” Hendler added. “They went to his house to play on his piano and talk to him.”\nHis grandson, Mashav Ridler, wrote on Facebook that our “heroic and strong and beloved grandfather was murdered. I don’t even have words to describe what a special man he was, how much he meant to me and how much I am me because of him.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was buried in Mount Herzl in Jerusalem on October 10.\nKrasniansky, who left the ultra-Orthodox world at age 17, was killed while fighting Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Nahal Oz.\nThough serving in the security services is considered a taboo in the Haredi world, Krasniansky’s mother, Zvia told Channel 13 news that what was good for their late son had been good for them and that he always did things with his whole heart.\nHe had shown “heroism of the spirit and the soul.”\nZvia later told 103M Radio that her son had “a love of Israel that could not be explained, he was a bright and humble guy. Yaakov never spoke about where he was stationed or what he was doing.”\nShe said that she was “happy that Yaakov got to where he did.

You don’t understand how many he killed, how many he saved, how many kibbutz families are alive today thanks to him and his friends.”\nTibon said the meeting was one of the most moving experiences of his life. “There I was, a left-wing kibbutznik, a journalist for [the left-of-center] Haaretz, sitting in front of Yaakov’s mother, a Haredi woman, and I’m telling her, ‘Thank you for your hero son, who fought for us and saved us and paid with his life.'”\n“I so wanted to hug her, but I don’t know what the [modesty] rules are,” he went on. “And then she just gave me her hands, and we held hands, and we hugged, and cried together, and I told her the truth — that thanks to her son, and his heroic friends, we can hug our daughters before we go to sleep.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

PNA said that Alacre had been attending the Supernova music festival when she was murdered, although a family member later disputed this report.\n“We love Loreta very much, she was very kind to all of us,” her sister, Anabella, was quoted as saying by a local news site at the airport the day of her body’s arrival. “I am very angry at the people who did this to her, she would still be with us today if they had spared her.”\nAnabella earlier said that Alacre was generous to her extended family: “She was sending her nephews and nieces to school and was helping all of her siblings with various needs,” she said. “Loreta also paid for hospital bills, birthdays, weddings, baptisms and funerals of family members.”\nNoam Solomon wrote on Facebook that Alacre had been “my devoted caregiver of the last 6 years,” describing her as “my beloved and dear Lorie… an inseparable part of my family.”\nAt her funeral, the mayor of Cadiz City, Salvador Escalante Jr., memorialized her as “an icon of perseverance, persistency, hope and selflessness. She had always thought of her family’s welfare.”\n“She may be out of sight, but her memories highlighted by her unique heroism will linger in us Cadiznons,” Escalante added.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Sgt. First Class (res.) Omer Balva, 22, was on vacation in Maryland, where he was born and lived until graduating from high school, when Hamas launched its bloody onslaught on October 7.\nThe child of Israeli parents who lived in the United States for decades, Balva, recently finished a stint in the Israel Defense Forces and was among the 360,000 reservists called up as Israel mobilized to defend itself. Like an untold number of Israelis in the United States, he quickly booked a flight, packed safety gear and headed home.\nThere, Balva was killed on October 20 by a rocket fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon, just days after he was deployed to Israel’s northern border.\nBalva’s death was a blow not only to his family and country but to his friends and teachers from Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School in Rockville, Maryland, which he attended starting in second grade. After graduating in 2019, he moved to Israel to join the IDF.\nThe pluralistic Jewish school mourned Balva, whom it said had been “a beloved student,” on its Facebook page. “Omer was an unabashed advocate for the State of Israel. He is a hero to the State of Israel, the Jewish people, and the school,” the school wrote. “We are devastated and heartbroken.”\nDozens of condolences from people who knew him followed, including one woman who said he had performed in a school production of “Mamma Mia!” alongside her son.\nBalva detailed his family’s ties to Israel in a class presentation posted online when he was a high school junior. His father’s family had been in the land since being expelled from Spain during the Inquisition, he wrote, and his grandmother survived a 1938 Arab massacre of Jews in her native Tiberias when she was hidden between two mattresses. While his parents moved to the United States in 1996, he said the family spoke only Hebrew at home.\n“One day I plan on moving back to Israel and raising my children in the Jewish land,” he wrote in the presentation. He added, “My passion has always been to protect Israel and suggest what is best for what I believe is the greatest country in the world.”\nBalva had recently enrolled at Reichman University in Herzliya, Israel, where he was studying business and economics, according to his LinkedIn profile. He had returned to Maryland to visit friends during the Sukkot holiday.\n“He was such a loving person,” one of those friends, Ethan Missner, told the Washington Post. “He brought a lot of light to the world.”\nBalva and Missner had spent the night before Balva’s return flight to Israel packing supplies for his IDF unit, as part of a massive effort to supply Israeli troops with necessary supplies. Unusually for them, they also put on phylacteries, the leather straps and boxes that Jews wear on the head and on the arm, typically during weekday morning prayers, Missner’s father told the Forward.\nBalva is survived by his parents, Sigal and Eyal, and his three siblings, Barak, Shahar and Itai. He was buried October 22 in the military cemetery in Herzliya.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

We always tried to tackle him and take him down, but he was too strong for us. We didn’t mind. He was like a big brother to us all.”\nKaminka’s mother said their sense of loss will never truly go away.\n“It’s like a car with a wheel missing,” she told Fox. “You know, there’s a part that’s not there, and you can’t — nothing can fix that.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

But he chose to enter a combat unit, completing the course for Lotar — an elite special unit dealing with counter-terrorism.\nMaj. Sagi Golan (left) and his betrothed, Omer Ohana. (Screenshot)\nOn the morning of October 7, he and Ohana — both high-tech workers — woke up in their apartment in coastal Herzliya and turned the radio on to hear the morning news.\nGolan “jumped out of bed, he didn’t get up,” Ohana told Channel 12 news through tears.\nEven though nobody called on him to report for duty, “He had his uniform in hand, he brushed his teeth, and within a few minutes, we were at the front door,” Ohana said. “He gave me a kiss on the lips, and he said [he’d be back in] ‘Less than a week.'”\nGolan, 30, originally from the central city of Ra’anana, was killed leading his unit on the evening October 7. Formal notice of his death only came early several days later.\nAccording to Ohana, the soldier sent to deliver the bitter news wasn’t used to mixing with gay couples and made a point of saying it.\nOn the form Ohad was asked to sign, there was no place for a male partner. “I asked for something, and they said I had to request his parents,” Ohana recalled. “It made me so angry. I was the one who loved him. But I’m not taken into account. And he wasn’t taken into account.”\nAn IDF spokeswoman said parents were the address for a fallen soldier if the soldier had been neither married nor known in common law to have had a partner, and that this applied to heterosexual and homosexual couples in the same way.\nIf Ohana wanted to be recognized as Golan’s common law partner, he could apply to the Defense Ministry. The couple had planned to have children, via a surrogate. Golan’s sperm was frozen after he died.\nGolan’s mother, Eti, told Channel 12, that there was “no reason in the world” for the state not to honor his son’s wish to have children, and that “under no circumstances” would Omer Ohana not be recognized as the father of her grandchild.\nOpposition Leader Yair Lapid told the Ynet news site that Golan “fell in the battle for Be’eri. Sagi and his partner Omer were about to get married. The State of Israel must treat Omer exactly as they treat any spouse of a fallen warrior. If Sagi is good enough to die for his country, he deserves that his own country will respect the person that his heart chose, allow him to have a child, and embrace him with love. I promise you, Omer, I will be by your side.”\nThe couple met six years ago, and Golan proposed a year ago on a volcano in Tenerife, Ohana said.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

How can it be that you were at the peak of your life and they cut it short like this? How can I and everyone who’s ever loved you live with the fact that we’ll never see your smile again?\nAnother friend Stav Aharoni wrote that “there are people who have a job in this world, they’re not just like anyone else — they’re people of light, generosity, goodness — you were one of those people. Your huge heart was impossible to miss… you will be so greatly missed, but I’m sure that you gave such a lesson to so many people and made the world a slightly better place.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Yaron Oree Shay, 21, a combat soldier in the Israel Defense Forces’ Nahal Brigade, was killed on October 7 during fierce clashes with Hamas terrorists in the Kibbutz Kerem Shalom area near the border with the Gaza Strip.\nFormer Science and Technology Minister Izhar Shay recounted that his beloved son’s heroic actions protected hundreds of people who owe their lives to his unit’s young brave soldiers.\n“He was killed while protecting civilians, fighting hundreds of Hamas terrorists, not letting them reach the civilians and female soldiers who were under his unit’s watch,” said Shay.\n“The price this special unit paid was very painful, and we are still praying for some critically wounded soldiers, but the mission was accomplished – Kerem Shalom was not conquered by the enemy, they suffered minimal casualties, and all female soldiers were saved without any physical injury,” said Shay.\nTrying to sum up the lifetime experience of 21 years with the “perfect beloved child,” whom he called Noni, Shay told a personal experience they shared.\n“Noni was tough and cynical, with humor and wit… an athlete, but he was also a very talented piano player,” Shay said. “He played piano for many years, but only for himself… he never agreed to play in front of an audience… he loved playing Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah.”\n“We would play this piece together sometimes,” said his father.\nIn a passionate plea, Shay, a high-tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist who briefly served as Science Minister in 2020, on Thursday called on fellow tech investors and founders to join his initiative to commit to founding a new startup for each of the heroes who gave their lives to protect the country, and for each murdered baby.\n“Over the next 12 months, for every fallen soldier, for every murdered civilian, let’s put together a new innovative startup that will build a product or service that will serve thousands of companies and/or millions of people around the world,” he said.\n“Let’s put together a moral response to this evil attack on humanity by putting the foundations for thousands of new innovative businesses that will make this world better in so many ways,” said Shay.\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Mor Cohen, 24, an athlete in Israel’s small but potent lacrosse scene, from Azor, was murdered by Hamas terrorists at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nWhen the rocket fire began, Mor and his friend hurried to leave the site of the festival in their car. They made it to the junction outside Kibbutz Mefalsim when they slowed at the sight of a burning car on the side of the road. Stopping to help, they were ambushed by terrorists who opened fire, fatally wounding Mor, and injuring his friend, who managed to survive.\nHis family searched for him for days until his body was identified. Mor was buried in Tel Aviv. He is survived by his parents, Eli and Hana, and his younger siblings Eden Alin and Idan.\nBorn in Beersheba, his family moved to Ramat Gan when he was 6, later settling in Azor. His family said he was a lover of nature who enjoyed camping, and a free spirit, attending the Open Democratic School in Tel Aviv because of its flexible approach to education.\nAt age 14 he began playing lacrosse, as the sport was first gaining popularity in Israel, and became one of the country’s star players.\nMor “was one of our first lacrosse players, having helped start the team in Tel Aviv and our coexistence program… a remarkable young man, Mor touched the lives of everyone he encountered,” Israel Lacrosse Association said in a statement.\nIsraeli lacrosse player Mor Cohen (Facebook screen capture, used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)\nMor played in 2016 for Israel’s U-19 national lacrosse team, and represented South Jersey in the 2014 Maccabiah Games.\n“I remember his smile when he played and I remember all the original group of kids to pick up lacrosse in Israel. Mor was one of the pioneers of Israel Lacrosse. Mor’s life was tragically cut short senselessly by terrorists. Mor was family or ‘mishpachah.’ Our family is devastated by the loss of Mor, who just wanted to go listen to some music in the desert with his friends. Mor loved lacrosse and when I play again I’ll play for Mor and all those that can’t,” coach David Dennenberg posted on Facebook.\nFor the four years before his death, Mor worked for the Tatti bakery and cafe chain, working his way up to ultimately manage the storefront in Tel Aviv’s Dizengoff Square. In a post on social media, the cafe said it was shocked by his loss: “We will always remember you, a pure angel, who loved others and loved life.”\nHis father, Eli, wrote in a post on Facebook that “Mor was a person with a wide heart, polite, patient, who aspired to visit vast and breathtaking destinations. He had a connection to nature, he loved to travel and to climb to high places and enjoy beautiful views. Everyone admired him and his approach to life, which was always positive, and he always acted in accordance with his motto: ‘Everything happens for a reason.'”\nMor’s sister, Eden Alin, wrote on Facebook about Mor’s sunny outlook on life and all those around him he touched.\n“Mor wouldn’t just say ‘stay positive’ or ‘everything happens for a reason’ or ‘let it go,'” she wrote. “Mor had been applying this for years, Mor made it into a way of life, there was nothing that could break him. There was nothing he didn’t believe, there was no moment that he spoke to himself badly, there wasn’t a second where he judged on first impressions, he always saw something good in everything bad.”\nEden Alin added that “Mor was such a mature, old soul, with wisdom that truly none of us quite understood. I feel him smiling, and nodding, because I’m right. He succeeded, he understood the meaning of life before all of us and his mission here on earth was completed. His soul didn’t need to keep going.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Suhaib Abu Amer Razeem, 22, from East Jerusalem, was killed in Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7 after he was kidnapped by Hamas from the Supernova music festival and brought there to serve as a translator.\nRazeem, a minibus driver, was waiting near the site of the festival to bring partygoers home when Hamas attacked. Footage from that day shows Hamas accosting Razeem and demanding to know who he was. Some of the terrorists in the video suggest letting him go, nevertheless they kidnapped him and brought him to Be’eri.\nIn Be’eri, the terrorists brought Razeem to the home of Pessi Cohen, where he and 14 other civilians were held together, while Hamas attempted to negotiate with IDF soldiers who had arrived on the scene.\nThe terrorists used the hostages as a bargaining tool to demand safe passage to Gaza, intending to bring the hostages with them. They threatened to kill the hostages if the IDF opened fire. According to the two survivors from inside the house, the terrorists positioned the hostages between themselves and advancing IDF troops as a gun battle blazed.\nOne terrorist surrendered, using one of the survivors, Yasmin Porat, as a human shield as he exited the house, thus saving her. The gunfire between the sides continued for several hours, until, near dusk, the terrorists launched a rocket-propelled grenade toward the troops, according to reports. IDF commander Brig. Gen. Barak Hiram ordered troops to fire two tank shells at the house. Only one civilian emerged alive from the carnage. It is not clear who inside the home was killed from IDF fire and who was slain by the terrorists, and the family members of those killed inside the house have demanded an investigation.\nRazeem’s body was only identified 12 days later, during which time his family searched frantically for news, unaware of his whereabouts.\nUltimately they announced the confirmation of his death “with great sadness and grief… we had hoped that you would return.” He was buried on October 19 in Jerusalem.\nThe circumstances and location of his death were not known until weeks after he was killed. His family said that they were originally mistreated by the police when they tried to track down his whereabouts, and told to “go ask Hamas.”\nHis brother, Abed, told the Kan public broadcaster that “all day I think [about him], I can’t sleep at night, I’ve had enough of life.”\nIn December, Abed and another brother, Mahmood, retraced Suhaib’s footsteps with The New York Times while attempting to uncover his true fate.\n“If they knew he was Arab,” said Abed, “why didn’t they let him go?”\nMahmood said, “People ask me who killed him, but I don’t know how he died. I decided to come here to try to find out, hoping that if I know more about his last moments, the pain will ease.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Staff Sgt. Aner Elyakim Shapiro, 22, an unarmed off-duty soldier in the Nahal Brigade’s elite reconnaissance unit, from Jerusalem, was slain while attending the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nAner attended the rave next to the Gaza border with a group of friends from Jerusalem, including his close childhood friend, Hersh Goldberg-Polin. When the rocket fire began, they left via car and stopped on the side of the road to seek safety in a roadside bomb shelter next to Kibbutz Re’im.\nAner and his friends were among the last people to squeeze inside the shelter, where they soon realized that terrorists were gathering outside to attack. Aner positioned himself at the entrance to the shelter, and in video that later emerged from a dashcam, he can be seen catching and throwing back seven grenades before the eighth exploded and killed him.\nUltimately, of the 27 people who were holed up inside the shelter, only seven emerged alive. Aner and many others, including Ayelet Arnin, Laor Abramov, Tamar Samet and Segev Kizhner were slain inside the shelter. Four people were kidnapped — Alon Ohel, Eliya Cohen, Or Levy — whose wife, Eynav, was murdered there — and Aner’s close friend Hersh, who was murdered in captivity close to a year later.\n“Aner Shapiro… saved our lives and he deserves a a medal of honor for being an angel who guarded us,” wrote attack survivor Agam in a Facebook post. Agam, who was herself injured as she crouched inside the doorless shelter, said that when the terrorists first approached, Aner declared his intention to block the grenade attacks and rallied others to help him.\nAner was buried on Jerusalem’s Mount Herzl on October 13. He is survived by his parents, Shira and Moshe, and his six younger siblings, Talia, Ayala, Ariel, Tamara, Alma and Hila.\nHe grew up in the Arnona neighborhood of Jerusalem, as the oldest of seven in a religious family, attending the Himmelfarb school in the capital before enlisting in the IDF. He had dreamed of serving in the elite Sayeret Matkal unit but was wounded twice during tryouts, ultimately joining the Nahal Brigade and eventually serving in the Orev company in its special forces unit.\nHis great-grandfather was Haim Moshe Shapiro, a former Israeli lawmaker and minister who was a signatory of Israel’s Declaration of Independence. Shapiro was seriously injured when a Jewish immigrant, Moshe Dwek, threw a grenade into the Knesset plenum hall in 1957.\nAs a young child, Aner was always creating, writing stories, illustrating them, playing the piano and eventually discovered a love for rap and hip-hop. He had composed and produced five songs before he was killed, and a sixth song, “Hatred of Brothers,” was posthumously produced with the help of rapper and producer Avery G., and with rapper Shaanan Streett of Hadag Nachash, who wrote and recorded a final verse.\n“He had a personality of leadership and a love of people,” his father, Moshe, told The Jerusalem Post in an interview. “Aner was born 22 years ago, a Jerusalem boy with a great love for music and painting. Until the age of 18, he was a painter; and on the other hand, he really loved sports and fitness.”\n“He had a developed sense of justice and love for people. If he saw someone not being properly taken care of, he would get angry and go to their aid,” Moshe added. “He really liked to sit with people and talk to them. He wrote songs, composed and sang, and left hundreds of written texts. Dealing with pressing issues in Israeli society is what kept him busy.”\nHis mother, Shira, told Ma’ariv a year after he was killed that “Aner is still here, I’m his mother even more so now. People can keep living after death in a very powerful way, and that’s what happened with Aner. His breakthrough into the public consciousness in light of what happened is just one element. But his music, his personality are also alive with us, very much so. Despite him physically not being here.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Among the friends celebrating with him were Hanan Yablonka, who was presumed captive in Gaza for more than 7 months, until his body was recovered in late May by the IDF, which said he had been killed on October 7 and his body taken hostage.\nLior was buried on October 12 in Ra’anana. He is survived by his three children, Rom, 18, Sun, 17 and Amor, 16, his mother, Mimi, and his siblings Moshe, Dado and Ortal. His father, Avi, died in 2021.\nAsulin played as a striker for numerous top Israeli teams, including 10 years with Maccabi Herzliya, during a professional career that spanned from 1997-2017, in which he tallied 176 goals. After retiring he pursued a career as a coach, although his legal troubles cut that path short.\n“The Hapoel Tel Aviv club bows its head and sends condolences and strength to Lior’s family at this difficult time,” one of his former clubs said in a statement.\nAsulin spent eight months in prison in 2022 as part of a plea deal for dealing drugs. He told Ynet following his release that being in prison was difficult, but he found solace in his faith as well as his plans and dreams for the future.\n“What kept me sane was the knowledge that when I left there, I was going to do everything I could to never go back,” he said in an interview in 2022 following his release. “Get up, work, rehabilitate my life and my relationships with my family and my children.”\nHis brother, Moshe, told a sports podcast that “in the soccer world he was Lior and at home he was my little brother. Always smiling, always playful, always laughing, always helping… it’s a huge loss for the world of sport, for the world of soccer, for our personal lives. He loved life, he loved to do everything. That was Lior.”\nMoshe said that after Lior’s release from prison, “it was a very difficult period. He left soccer and tried to find his place. There’s no lower place than prison,” he said, but in a way, the arrest set him on a new path: “He was released, worked two jobs, tried to make a living on his own and take care of his kids. He understood there was a life after soccer, after success, and he succeeded in doing that. I saw him dealing with it.”\nLior’s sister, Ortal, told Walla that “if anyone else had gone through what he went through, they would lower their head, be depressed, and not get out of bed — but Lior was the opposite. To him sleeping was a curse, he had 40 hours in the day, not 24. He would go from party to friends and then to his parents and then go make music — he lived life, took advantage of life, tried everything and tasted everything. That’s something you can’t say about a lot of people.”\nHis mother, Mimi, told Channel 13 news that in his recent years he was “satisfied, sweet, he had finally found his place.”\nMimi said her son “was a good soul… what else can I say about him? I lost my soul,” she said. “You know who Lior was. A soccer player, a good boy, a good friend, loyal.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He always helped people who were alone or weak.” Ayelet said his dream was to work in agriculture, “to establish an orchard here, a winery, to cultivate a farm here — he had the blueprints and he had it all planned out on paper… He was very organized, knew what he wanted.”\nHe really “loved the moshav, the land, loved agriculture — on the one hand, he was such a moshavnik, but on the other hand, he also loved parties, raves, festivals,” and also had a spiritual-religious side, his mother said.\nJust after he was killed, Imbar wrote online to “my Zuri, the best person I knew.”\n“We met almost eight years ago and I fell in love with you immediately,” she wrote. “I always thought to myself, how can it be that I lucked out with such a perfect boyfriend… Your whole life was devoted to doing good. You were always dedicated to helping, to spreading light, to unifying and creating.”\nImbar said she found out after he was killed that he had been planning to propose, “I would have said yes to you a thousand times!”\n“I am comforted by the fact that you aren’t here to see the horrors going on in our country,” she added. “Your sweet heart would hurt and crumple. I love you my beautiful. I promise you that I will make sure everyone knows how wonderful your journey in this life was.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He was shot in the back, and his wounds could not be treated in time to save him.\nAmit, a retired Shin Bet operative and an official member of the town’s local security team, was posthumously recognized by the Defense Ministry as a fallen soldier with the rank of warrant officer in the reserves, after he was killed in a gun battle with Hamas terrorists. He is survived by his wife, Einat, and three children: Daniel, Talia and Oriya.\nThe brothers were also both survived by their father, Alfredo, an immigrant from Argentina, and their younger brothers Nimrod and Gilad. Back-to-back funerals for Igal and Amit were held on October 17 in the Palmahim Cemetery near Rishon Lezion, and they were buried in Netiv Ha’asara.\nAccording to a Shin Bet eulogy, Amit began his career in the agency in 1999, and quickly moved up in the ranks due to his “exceptional level of discipline and high motivation.” He was a “responsible and hard-working person, who acted quietly and modestly together with an intense passion,” the eulogy read, noting that his superiors said he was the guy who “could be relied on with ‘closed eyes.'”\nA friend eulogized Amit on Facebook as someone “who instilled confidence and a feeling that everything was going to be alright. Hundreds of people knew him, he volunteered in every place, always with a big smile, always modestly, always with a huge heart.”\nAmit’s daughter, Cpl. Daniel Wachs, a technician in the Israeli Air Force, said in an IAF article that she knew her father would go out to fight: “That’s who he was. We had no doubt that if something was going on he would be the first to lend a hand.”\nDaniel said her father “loved to hike, and he would always promise us a short path and then we’d end up walking for a long time. He had a license for everything in the world, he taught us off-roading,” she said. “I’m glad we experienced so much with him and we have such significant memories from him.”\nHer uncle Igal as well, she said, “knew how to do so many things, he was a welder and he would fix cars, he loved to cook and to play sports — they were both so wonderful.”\nTheir father, Alfredo, told a local news outlet, “I wasn’t surprised by what my children did [that day].

Roni Eshel, 19, an observation soldier in the Border Defense Corps’s 414th unit, was killed during the Hamas onslaught on southern Israel on October 7.\nShe was considered missing for more than a month, as her parents begged publicly and desperately for information, until on November 9 the IDF finally confirmed that she had been killed during the initial attack.\nRoni’s mother, Sharon Eshel, posted a death notice on her Facebook page, notifying people about the funeral held on November 12 in the Kfar Saba military cemetery.\n“My beloved girl. My Roni-ki. We went all over the world to find you. But we didn’t succeed. I love you my darling girl, I love you so much,” wrote Eshel on Facebook.\nThe family lives in Tzur Yitzhak, near Kochav Yair.\nEshel, 19, had been in the army for a year and two months, working as one of the communication lookouts at an army base near Kibbutz Nahal Oz — part of the team of soldiers who watch the feeds from the cameras placed on the high-tech barrier that was breached by Hamas terrorists.\nEyal Eshel, Roni’s father, stated in many interviews that Roni had told the family that Hamas was studying the border.\n“‘Dad, they’re studying us,'” she told Eshel. “‘They’re doing their homework. They know almost every corner of the fence itself.'”\nEyal Eshel visited the Nahal Oz base where Roni was stationed, and saw the Emergency Operation Center destroyed.\nOn October 7, Eshel’s mother received a text at 9:27 a.m. from Roni, saying that she was okay and in the command room of the base, meant to be a secure space. It was the last time the family heard from her.\n“She really liked her job in the army,” Eshel’s uncle, Guy Malki told The Times of Israel. “She felt a sense of mission in what she was doing, defending the land.”\nIn some ways, what Roni did in the army came naturally to her. She was the eldest of three, with two younger brothers whom she protected or got cross with when necessary, said her uncle. He called her “super responsible.”\nShe was also a teenager who enjoyed life, Malki said, “enjoying what all kids love to do, music and American culture and Taylor Swift and Maroon 5,” who she saw in concert in Tel Aviv last year.\nAt her funeral, her father said that “like everyone else, she planned what she would do after her army service, and how to take the world by storm. In one day that all came to an end.”\n“I believed with all my heart the entire month that you would come home to us,” he added. “Roni was warm, witty and kind-hearted. Our Roni, I want you to know that we fought for 35 days like a lion and lioness for our cub… Roni I’m sorry. I failed. I failed in bringing you home.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

That way perhaps we can overcome this terrible blow,” he said.\nHis sister Ayelet, recalled at his funeral his childhood, how “you were always the most organized kid in the house, everything you had was arranged by height and color. You were a symbol for us of stability and security.” She recounted how at the start of the Gulf War, when he was just 10 years old, “you rushed to wake everyone up to go into the sealed room. You led the occasion.”\nAyelet said his most defining characteristics were “modesty and humility. Without bragging or bells and whistles, you always took action and didn’t tell us the details. You taught us that you can express yourself with a smile and a wink. You knew the difference between what was major and what was minor. You were so appreciated and loved, a true friend… we were so proud to be the siblings of Yoni.”\nTwo months after he was killed, his wife, Yisca, told Kan public radio that the family was still struggling to adjust to their new normal.\n“What do we need? What would Yoni want to happen here? We had a family task, the mission of being a military family — now we need to find what our new family mission is,” she said.\nYisca said her husband was “a family man, very present even when he wasn’t physically here. He invested so much in the family, he made sure to find time to come home, he would come even at the expense of extra hours of sleep he was missing. He made nonsense with the kids, activities, he was very present. He knew how to give every child what he needed… he was our anger, with so much spirit, leadership.

Eden Nimri, 22, a swimmer who competed internationally for Israel and served as a commander in the Artillery Corps’ drone unit, was killed on October 7 while fighting Hamas terrorists in the IDF Nahal Oz outpost.\nEden served as a commander of an all-female team in the elite “Sky Riders” unit. Her family said that on the morning of the attack, they were stationed at Nahal Oz — covering for another team that was on break — and when the sirens began, she ran with her team to the bomb shelter.\nArmed but still in pajamas, Eden positioned herself at one of the two entrances of the shelter, a concrete structure which does not fully close, aiming to protect the large number of unarmed observation soldiers also inside. She opened fire on the first terrorist to enter, but he was followed by many more, armed with grenades and assault rifles. Eden was killed, but 11 soldiers, including the four other members of her Sky Riders unit, managed to run for safety from the second entrance, while many others inside the shelter were killed and kidnapped.\nEden is survived by her parents, Sharon and Michael, and her siblings Hadar and Noga. She was buried on October 13 in Modiin.\nAccording to an IDF obituary, Eden had wide and varied interests in her youth, including ballet, jazz, chess, photography and theater, but none as much as swimming, a love she inherited from her parents. She joined the Israeli youth team and became dedicated to practices and competitions, competing in Israel and abroad and arriving at school each day with wet hair from early-morning practice.\nEden represented Israel at the 2018 European Junior Open Water Swimming Championships, where she finished 30th. She also competed at the International School Sport Federation’s 2017 World Championships and at the 2014 Mediterranean Cup.\n“Eden was an amazing girl, a good friend, competitive, extremely hardworking, highly self-disciplined, worked hard, always aimed high, set goals and met them,” the Israel Swimming Association wrote on Instagram.\nHer family said that she could have served under the special conditions of an “outstanding athlete” in the IDF, allowing her to still train and compete, but she chose instead an all-encompassing army route. When she first enlisted, she started a pilots’ course, but ultimately didn’t make it through the very challenging path, and ended up in the Sky Riders.\nHer favorite holiday was Purim, her loved ones said, and each year she would spend hours designing and creating the perfect costume, including one year as falafel in a pita.\nHer boyfriend, who can’t be named due to his army service, told Kan public radio that Eden was “the most beautiful, the smartest, the bravest.”\n“She coolly led a battle on Saturday morning together with her fighters and ultimately sacrificed herself so they would stay alive,” he added.\nHer mother, Sharon, told Israel Hayom that Eden “always excelled, always demanded more from herself. Eden was very modest — she always planned to achieve bigger things, but only in competition with herself, not with others.”\nSharon said Eden “had dreams from here to Honolulu, she studied to be a coach and swim counselor and she thought that after the army she would go back to swimming, but also work in real estate and maybe even be a brain researcher. She even enjoyed fashion as well.”\nEden’s older sister, Hadar, told Haaretz that “she would break down barriers without even trying.” She wanted to be an Israel Air Force pilot, “and she believed she could do it because she was a woman. She wasn’t deterred by the fact that only 10% of people in the course were girls, she understood that those percentages weren’t because girls can’t do it.”\nHadar said Eden saw no contradiction between being both a tough fighter and a feminine woman: “She was the most girly you could imagine, but the biggest warrior, impressive, noble — that’s what was so groundbreaking about her.” Hadar said Eden “always wanted to be in a happy atmosphere, she was crazy funny. She was just kind and it was important to her for those around her to have fun. She was a wonderful sister, always caring and worrying. She was so busy, but in her own way she was also very caring and concerned.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

She was buried on October 17 in Holon.\nBorn in France, Celine moved to Israel at age 16 with her family and settled in Ashdod; after getting married the couple lived in Holon.\nFriends and family said Celine was slated to return to work after six months of maternity leave, and went to the party as one last celebration before her return to working as an administrative assistant at a law firm.\nCeline attended the rave with her friend Shiraz Tamam and her husband Adir Tamam, but they never reached the event. The friends turned their car around when rockets began falling around 6 a.m., and ran to a field shelter on the outskirts of a community.\nCeline last updated her husband that the IDF was on their way and she was sure she would be rescued. He never heard from her again, and was convinced that she had been kidnapped.\n“She is an amazing woman, a person who is surrounded by friends and love,” Ido told the BBC during the period in which she was missing. “And she is an amazing mother. We have a six-month old baby. This was supposed to be her one last party to enjoy before she returned to work. We agreed that I would pick her up at midnight, but she never came home.”\nHer friend, Yaelle Krief, penned a letter on Facebook to six-month-old Ellie, recalling how they first met while in high school and studying Hebrew in ulpan together.\n“Ellie, your mother was so beautiful, inside and out, and you look so much like her,” she wrote. “Ellie, I am writing these words to you because you probably won’t remember her smile, her warmth, or how her voice sounds. So many people knew her, loved her, appreciated her. I think we must write and speak about her to honor her memory, and so that she will live in you forever. So that you never forget how special your mother was.”\nOn what would have been their two-year wedding anniversary, on November 1, Ido wrote to Celine on Facebook, about “the day you walked toward me in a white dress, at the height of emotions, with the happiest tears there are in your eyes.”\nNagar said “it was clear to me that you were the woman of my life, the ultimate partner to embark on the journey of life.” From the moment they first met, he said, “it was clear to both of us that this was forever.” At the wedding, he said, they “said the blessings, got married, and from the moment we broke the glass… we didn’t stop celebrating, until that horrible Saturday.”\n“We were together almost four years, and married almost two years — full of experiences, full of memories. You insisted we experience, you insisted we photograph and document everything. Thank you for that. You gave me four perfect years and I have everything I need to tell Ellie about all the happy moments we had together.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Her family said around 6:30 a.m. she told them about the rocket fire and around 8 a.m. she said they were trying to flee in a car, but were stuck in traffic. That was the last they heard from her.\nFor close to a week she was considered missing, until her body was found and identified. She was buried on October 15 in Ramat Yishai. She is survived by her parents, Efi and Ron, and her sister Nitzan.\nRegev worked as an editor for TMI, the gossip and entertainment news section of the Ma’ariv newspaper. According to Haaretz, Shai and Nir had moved into an apartment together in Tel Aviv just three weeks before they were killed. Shai had worked for Maariv for three years and started working for TMI a year ago, while she was studying communications at the Open University.\n“The cursed terrorists, animals, destroyed the life of our Shai — talented, creative and full of love,” said Ma’ariv editor-in-chief Golan Bar-Yosef in a statement. “We will always remember your magical smile.”\nNoa Rachamim, a good friend of Regev who also worked as a TMI editor, said the staff “is struggling to accept and absorb this horrible news about the death of our Shai, who was a major pillar of all TMI activities and our success… Today we lost not just a dedicated professional but also a real friend and a huge light, whose loss we will feel with every word and letter we write.”\nRegev’s final byline on TMI was on a story about Bruno Mars, the pop singer who performed in Israel just days before the Hamas massacre and was forced to cancel his sold-out Tel Aviv show planned for the evening of the attack.\nHer sister, Nitzan, described her to TMI as “a sunflower, a sunflower pointing toward the sun and absorbing light. Like a sunflower, you absorbed light your whole life, but you were a unique sunflower, because you didn’t only know how to absorb, and you didn’t just take the light for yourself, but you gave it to me, to our parents, to everyone in their hearts like an arrow of hope. We will try to make sure that the light you absorbed… will go only to angels.”\nMarking Israel’s “family day,” Shai’s mother, Efi Azoulay Regev, wrote on Facebook that “my family will never be perfect or whole again.”\n“My Shaiki, I always told you guys that it was mother’s day, not family day,” she continued. “Today I’m prepared to accept that it’s family day, if you will only be here with us. The longing and the pain do not heal, they only grow from day to day, from hour to hour. I have a huge hole in my body and the air that I breathe doesn’t manage to stay, it gets sucked into that huge hole.”\nEfi continued: “I told you, next to your beautiful headstone, that we have stayed a small, pained family but not destroyed. We will succeed, maybe, to get up and to live and maybe even to be happy. I’m trying Shaiki, really. But it’s so hard.

I feel lucky that I had the privilege of working with her almost every day at Kan.”\nBefore joining Kan, Arnin served in the IDF as a news editor with Army Radio.\nKan anchor Michal Rabinovich described her as a “bright star, the best among us,” adding that Arnin “was my favorite, we sat next to each other, shoulder to shoulder, you were my right hand.

She had many friends, she was a pillar of support, was always there for them.”\nHartston said Arnin blossomed in recent years at Army Radio and then later at Kan: “Ayelet was a gentle soul, full of good, a girl with clear values, values of empathy, helping others and endless generosity. Ayelet, you will always stay in our heart.”\nHer brother, Nimrod, one of the organizers of Supernova, wrote that “Ayelet my love, you will forever be a loving and supporting sister, loyal and family-oriented, the anchor and basis for everyone.”\n“It’s hard for me to speak about you in the past tense, it’s hard to think that I won’t see you again and won’t get to hug you,” he wrote. “I am choosing to capture all of our last moments together, the trip to Italy that was so important and now even more so… I’m sorry that I didn’t get to hug you and say hi when you came to the party, I was sure that we would have more time to dance together.\n“I’m sorry I didn’t protect you when we were there, I’m sorry I didn’t succeed in sending people to save you, I’m sorry that it ended this way.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Yasmin’s father, Haim Livne, was also murdered in the attack.\n“Yaniv was the first newsman to arrive at the scene of the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit, and widely covered the Gaza disengagement. He was a wonderful friend, a devoted father, a man with heart and generosity,” Israel Hayom said in a statement.\n“He would always run after the next frame, despite the difficult sights he was photographing,” the newspaper added.\nReporter Almog Boker eulogized his friend on X: “How much he loved the Gaza border towns, how much he loved Nahal Oz, how much he fought for his home. This dear and beloved man and talented photographer whose photos were broadcast around the world was murdered with his wife Yasmin and two daughters.”\nYaniv also worked in the past as a photographer for the AP news agency.\nAn online obituary described Yaniv as a “devoted and loving father,” and Yasmin as a “warrior mother.” Keshet was “smart, opinionated, sensitive and kind,” the eulogy reads, while Tehelet “was beautiful and an excellent student,” who had only just started a year of national service working with troubled youth.\nYasmin worked as an accountant and later moved to work in educational administration at the Sapir College, and was also pursuing a PhD at at Ben Gurion University in Beersheba which explored relationships between teachers and parents.\nHer friend and fellow student Liron Motero told Ynet that they became the unlikeliest of friends during their studies: “I’m religious with a head covering, she’s a secular kibbutznik, but our connection was deep and our conversations diverged from studies and became deep conversations. On the one hand, she was very task-oriented but also spiritual.” Motero noted that a year before she was killed, Yasmin and her two daughters, Keshet and Tehelet, got matching tattoos of dragonflies, “which symbolized for her the harmony between the physical and heavenly worlds.”\nKeshet’s teacher, Limor Moshe, who guided her at a school in Ashkelon that prepared youth with special needs for army or national service, described her as the “energy of the class, the light of the class, she always joined people together… despite the difficulties she had, she never gave up and would always take to heart suggestions and comments she received.”\nTehelet’s former counselors in her youth group, Gaya and Naomi, described her as “talented and caring, a leader of the group and the campers, a wonderful counselor who truly loved her charges. She was smart and a leader, and a partner you could rely on.”\nAt their funeral in Rishon Lezion on October 17, the four bodies of Yaniv, Yasmin, Keshet and Tehelet lay side by side, as Ariel, 13, watched his entire family be buried.\nShuval Cohen, the couple’s niece, eulogized them in tears: “Where to begin? My Yanivi, the cool uncle. The talented photographer. Thank you that I had the privilege of being your first niece. Yasmini, you always brought everyone together. I remember the fairies you used to bring me as a child.”\n“My Keshet, my beloved cousin, my soulmate, you were the sun for everyone. My Keshet, how much I was thinking about you on that terrible Saturday. My beloveds, amid all this tragedy there was also a visible miracle. Your Arieli survived. I promise to watch over him, to raise him as my little brother. Rest in peace, and come to us in our dreams. We’ll take care of everything else.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

    "story": "Angelyn Aguirre, 32, a native of the Philippines, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7.\nShe is survived by her husband, Nicolas, her parents William and Erlinda, seven siblings and many nieces and nephews. Her remains arrived in the Philippines on November 3 for burial.\nHer family said she got married in September 2022 and flew back to Israel just a few days later to resume work.\nAguirre worked caring for an elderly Israeli woman, Nira Ronen, and they were both slain side by side as they tried to hide inside the apartment’s safe room amid the Hamas onslaught.\n“In her last message, she told us the gunmen had arrived and she was scared,” Wilma Bandong, Aguirre’s eldest sister, told the Philippine Star newspaper. “What happened to my sister was so painful.”\nRamon Guico, the governor of the Pangasinan region from where she hailed, said Aguirre “is truly the embodiment of unselfish and compassionate service. She is the supreme example of unbelievable loyalty and boundless mercy… she has demonstrated the highest standards of stewardship.”\nHer sister, Angenica, who also worked in Israel as a caregiver, told the Manila Times that Angelyn could have run to try and escape the attackers, “but she did not want to leave her employer.” She said Angelyn tried to close the door of the bomb shelter to prevent the gunmen from entering, “but they overpowered her.”\nAngenica later wrote on Facebook: “You are always in my heart my dearest sister Angelyn. I love you very much.”\nMickey Barlev, who employed Aguirre in the past to care for his late family member in Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak, described her in a Facebook post as “the lovely Angie, basically an angel who came to the Holy Land to earn a living and support her family in the Phillipines,” noting that she cared for her charges “with endless dedication.”\nNira Ronen’s daughter, Chen Stein, described Angelyn as “a sensitive, gentle and devoted young woman who instilled a profound sense of security in our mother, which she dearly needed.”\nAguirre had been working as a caregiver in Israel for seven years and was planning on returning to the Philippines for good at the end of the year to start having children, her family said.\nIsraeli Ambassador to the Philippines Ilan Fluss paid a condolence call to the family after her body arrived home, recounting what he learned from her loved ones: “She was smart, she even learned Hebrew to be able to communicate with her Israeli patient easier,” Fluss said. “It was heartbreaking to learn that she lived with Nicolas for one week only after their wedding, and that they were planning to have a family by next year.”\nHer mother, Erlinda, told the Philippine News Agency in tears that her daughter was sweet and caring: “She would always video call us. Sometimes from morning till night time. Sometimes we would just let her talk as long as our cameras are open while we are watching television,” she said.\n“Angelyn is always the first to greet us in our group chat,” she said. “She was like that.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

He is survived by his parents, Hannah and Daniel, and his siblings Ezra, Tova, Noy, Yedaya and Tzviya.\nHe was buried on October 12 in Petah Tikva.\nHis uncle, Abe Katsman, described him in a Facebook post as a “musician, mechanic, horticulturist, writer, academic/PhD, and a very good grandson to my father.”\nBorn in Israel to American immigrant parents, Katsman had a bachelor’s degree from the Open University in philosophy and political science, a master’s degree from Ben-Gurion University in politics and a PhD from the University of Washington in international studies. He was active in several local peace organizations.\nHis neighbor, Avital Alajem, told CNN that the two of them were hiding in a closet as Hamas terrorists stormed into Kibbutz Holit on October 7, and he protected her with his body.\n“He was murdered,” Alajem told CNN. “I was saved… he was a wonderful person, he was a talented person, he was a funny person, he was someone who wanted to live.”\nWriting in The Jerusalem Post, his uncle, Aaron Katsman, noted that “Hayim’s motto was, ‘In every room I enter, there is someone smarter than me in some way.’ Considering that he had a PhD from the University of Washington, there’s a pretty good chance he was the smartest in the room. His motto spoke volumes about his character. He was modest, generous, intellectually honest, was very principled, stuck to his convictions, and really loved life.”\nHis sister, Tzviya, wrote on Facebook that “Hayim loved the land, people, words and music. He was involved in so many different things that it would be impossible to even begin listing them here. He was loved and he was a source of inspiration in a unique way. I miss him so much.”\nHis mother, Hannah Wacholder Katsman, a blogger and women’s rights activist originally from Cincinnati, told The Washington Post that her son wanted to live in Holit to help “revive this kibbutz that was aging and isolated and frankly dangerous” due to its proximity to Gaza.\nShe said that she knew her son “wouldn’t want this conflict to be used to kill innocent people.”\nWriting in a Times of Israel blog post in January, Hannah said that as the family began mourning, “Hayim’s friends, colleagues, teachers and students sent memories and pictures from his childhood, his recent trek to India, his years studying for his doctorate in Seattle, peace activism, music, and his life on Holit where he served as gardener and was recently elected as head of the kibbutz council.”\nShe added that among all the messages she received, “what stood out most was the variety and intensity of the connections that Hayim had made. Colleagues and friends alike noted how he approached each person as an individual, with no sense of ego or superiority. Most people he met didn’t know about his doctorate or his many talents. He saw everyone as equal, no matter their gender, race, religion, nationality or political opinions.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

At 9:48 a.m., she wrote that she had been wounded and that was the last anyone heard from her. Johnny texted his sister, Ranae Butler, “They’re here, they’re burning us, we’re suffocating,” she told CNN.\n“He and his wife were shot through the window, they managed to keep the window closed… they decided they’d [rather] suffer from smoke inhalation together and they held up while wounded,” Butler said. “Great bravery, I’m so proud of them.”\nA joint funeral for all six members of the family was held in Kibbutz Lahav on October 19.\nTamar grew up in Jerusalem and Johnny was raised in Nir Oz. The couple met during their army service and settled in the kibbutz.\nTamar was an artist and was also running to be mayor of the Eshkol region in elections that were supposed to be held in October and were delayed by the war. Johnny was an operations manager of the tractors and agricultural tools and grew wheat in the kibbutz.\nIn a eulogy, the kibbutz noted that the family “lived a peaceful and happy life on the same kibbutz where Johnny grew up. But on that terrible day, it was all cut short — too quickly, and far too soon. The Kedem family was a happy family until their last moments. That’s how we’ll always remember them.”\nAmir Zinder, who spent a year working in Nir Oz, wrote that “John was an admired figure throughout the kibbutz, the one everyone wanted would love them, the one all the national service volunteers spoke about… He managed everything with a smile and a huge passion for the fields of the kibbutz.”\nTamar’s sister, Noa Kedem, said Tamar was “a painter and worked in art, she was an educator and a social entrepreneur. She was a total autodidact,” Noa told Haaretz. “Everything she touched was a masterpiece. Everything got a creative treatment. When Yonatan had to explain something to the Thai farm workers connected to work, she would make them drawings so they could get over the language barrier.”\nNoa said that Johnny “had the hands of an artist, he taught Tamari to weld. A true handyman. Everyone knew that if you needed help, you go to John, and the answer was always yes. They had a great love between them and perfect synergy. He pushed her and allowed her to do what she loved and dreamed of. Without him, it wouldn’t have happened.”\nReuma Kedem, Tamar’s mother, wrote online a month following their murders: “Tamar, John, Arbeli, Shahar and Omriko, our beloved. The world has seen only your names written on my skin, but I want the world to know what a shining and huge light you were for us. In this world and the world to come.

He was predeceased by his mother Michal and brother Shahar. He was buried on October 12 in Petah Tikva.\nHis death marked the third tragedy in his immediate family.\nWhen he was 16 months old, his mother died of illness, leaving his father Avi to raise him. Three and a half years ago, his brother Shahar was killed in a motorcycle accident.\nHis girlfriend of three years, Osnat Hazam, said that she and his father and sister had been planning to take food to him on his base on that Saturday. The last conversation between the couple took place by video on Saturday morning.\n“He said there were missiles, showed me the skies, and there were dozens of rockets. He showed me he was sheltering behind a wall, and then said he saw a vehicle near the base and had to go and help because that was his job as a soldier. He told me he loved me the most in the world, but that he had to go and help civilians. We were still on video when suddenly he photographed half his body and said, ‘Ossi, I’m dead,’ and then the phone disconnected,” Hazam said.\nHazam said the couple met through friends and became close after his brother died and she was there to comfort him: “Since then we were always close together. The love of my life, and I of his. He made sure to tell me every day that I was the one.”\nShe said he was very close to his surviving family, and “made sure every night to tell his father, ‘Good night, I love you.’ He was the best person and the most understanding person I knew. He told me I would be the mother of his children and he even planned to fly abroad for a post-army trip to propose to me.”\nMizrahi had been due to be released from his military conscription a month after his death, his father said.\n“We were told that 400 terrorists attacked them and that Or fell first,” Stav, his 28-year-old sister, told the Maariv newspaper. She said he was devoted to her and to his father: “He always made sure I was happy. He wanted us to take a class in English together. He was the heart of the house, my best friend. We would share secrets, he told me everything.”\nStav told Channel 13 news in an interview that Or “always wanted for us to be united. Me, dad, Shahar, he always wanted us to love each other, not to fight, not to argue — and if there was, to make up and to love each other.”\nHis father, Avi, told a local news outlet, “We lost a dear boy. I don’t have words to describe how much I loved him. Or is now closer to God. Or said to me once, ‘I will be a great guy, you will be proud of me.’ I am proud of him now, too, because I know that he tried to save the people of Israel.”\nAvi added that “Or was a happy person, and would want to see us all here smiling, even clapping for him… He was all light.”\nRead more Those We Have Lost stories here."

Roi Nahary, 23, an officer in the Paratroopers Brigade, from Moshav Ora, just outside of Jerusalem, was wounded while battling Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Kfar Aza on October 7 , and died of his wounds two days later.\nHe was buried on October 13 on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.\nHe is survived by his parents, Iris and Ronen, his twin brother Bar, and his younger siblings Rotem and Omer.\nHe studied at Jerusalem’s Boyer School, and, determined to enlist in a combat unit, underwent surgery for a sports injury, which involved a long rehabilitation.\nAccording to Hebrew media, his family donated five of his organs, each of which was transplanted into a different patient, believing that this would have been his wish.\nNahari’s mother Iris issued a statement describing her son as an “esteemed officer,” who was “handsome and brave in every way.”\nHis little brother, Omer, wrote that two months after his death, “I am still waiting. Still waiting for you to come home and say it was a mistake and that it was somebody else. Waiting for one more basketball game with you, one more time we work out together, one more time I’ll see you come home from the army after a month.”\n“I always thought we were the four perfect siblings,” he said. “Your eyes would fill with pride every time one of the names of your siblings came up in conversation. The pride I had in being part of this foursome, the unique connection we all had despite the age gaps, the promising future the four of us had together, all the experiences we were supposed to still have. Each of us filled a part of that foursome, four of us together. Now we are three.”\nRoi’s younger sister, Rotem, wrote online about “20 years of being privileged to live beside you. My heart refuses to believe that you won’t be here any longer. You always defended me and protected me, I was always your little sister and you my big brother. Everywhere I went I shouted your name with pride… Conversations with you gave me strength and a hug from you filled me up.”\n“Nothing prepared me for the understanding that you won’t be at my wedding, I won’t see your face anymore and your perfect smile. My heart is shattered into a thousand pieces, everywhere I go reminds me of you. If you were by my side now… I would tell you that you were the best brother I could ask for, and I had the privilege of being your sister,” she wrote.\nMarking 30 days since he was killed, his family gathered at his graveside in Jerusalem to unveil his headstone.\n“At the start, we were two, and now I am one,” his twin brother Bar said at the memorial service. “We walked together, hand in hand, with a lot of faith in our path,” he said.\n“Justice. Is it just that you are not with me? That you were taken from me? Is it just that you have only a past and no future? Is it just that you will never get to stroke the hair of your children? To embrace and adopt my family as your own family? To celebrate with you, to live with you and to die with you?” Bar said at his twin’s graveside.\n“Is it just that I wasn’t there then to protect you?” he continued. “How, out of everyone, was it you? And how out of everyone was it me?” He noted that their “love for the State of Israel is endless… Roi is missed, he has been missed already for a month and he will be missed my entire life.”\n“I remember us as two little kids, two chicks, with little and strong hands and legs, running in tall grass, climbing hills, one with brown eyes and the other with curls. A duo… speaking in a language all our own, seeing the world through our eyes. I will remember us loving, growing up, laughing, being angry, leaving, returning, forgiving. I remember the connection we had — only us and nobody else… because you are me and I am you,” he said. “At the start, we were two.
